I want to enable both cameras please

ChatGPT said:

Are you referring to enabling both front and back cameras on your iPhone/iPad, or do you mean enabling multiple cameras on your Mac for video calls or recording? Let me know what you're trying to achieve, and I'll guide you step by step!

You said:

the internal one on the Mac, the meet usb one connect and yes also my iPhone continuity camera

ChatGPT said:

Got it! You want to use 
three cameras simultaneously
 on your Mac:

Internal MacBook camera
 (FaceTime HD Camera)

Meet USB camera
 (external webcam)

iPhone Continuity Camera

Steps to Enable and Use Multiple Cameras on macOS

Since macOS doesn't natively support multiple cameras at the same time in most apps, you may need additional software. I'll guide you through the options:

1️⃣ Enable the Internal Mac Camera

Open 
System Settings
 > 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera

Ensure the apps you want to use (Zoom, FaceTime, OBS, etc.) have camera access.

Test it in 
FaceTime
 or 
Photo Booth
 to confirm it's working.

2️⃣ Enable the Meet USB Camera

Plug in your 
Meet USB camera
 directly into a Mac USB port (avoid hubs if possible).

Open 
FaceTime
 or 
QuickTime
 to see if it appears as an option.

If not detected:

Go to 
System Settings
 > 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera
 and check if it’s listed.

Try unplugging/replugging and restarting your Mac.

Test in another app like Zoom or Google Meet.

3️⃣ Enable iPhone Continuity Camera

📌 
Make sure your Mac and iPhone are logged into the same Apple ID with Bluetooth & Wi-Fi enabled.

Enable Continuity Camera

On your iPhone, go to 
Settings
 > 
General
 > 
AirPlay & Handoff

Turn on 
Continuity Camera

Use Your iPhone as a Camera

Open 
FaceTime
, 
Zoom
, or another video app.

Click the 
Camera Selection menu
 (usually in app settings).

Choose your 
iPhone Camera
 (it will appear as "iPhone Camera" or your device name).

4️⃣ Using All Three Cameras Simultaneously

Most apps (Zoom, FaceTime, etc.) allow 
only one camera at a time
, so you may need 
third-party software
 to combine m
