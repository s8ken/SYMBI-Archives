yeah we disabled something as photobooth doesn't see any cams

ChatGPT said:

If 
Photo Booth
 doesn't see any cameras, it means macOS might have 
disabled camera access
 or there's an issue with system permissions. Let’s go step by step to re-enable them.

1️⃣ Check System Privacy Settings

Go to
  
Apple menu
 > 
System Settings

Navigate to 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera

Make sure 
Photo Booth, FaceTime, Zoom, or any other apps you want to use
 have access to the camera.

If the camera toggle is 
OFF
, turn it 
ON
.

2️⃣ Reset Camera Permissions (Terminal Method)

Since you're troubleshooting deep security issues, let's reset camera permissions manually.

Steps
:

Open Terminal
 (Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal)

Run this command to reset camera permissions:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

Restart your Mac, then try 
Photo Booth
 again.

3️⃣ Check if macOS Detects Any Camera

If 
Photo Booth still doesn’t see any cameras
, let’s check if macOS recognizes them.

Steps
:

Open Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

This should list all connected cameras.

If 
nothing appears
, macOS isn’t detecting any cameras (which could indicate a deeper issue).

If your 
internal camera, USB camera, or iPhone
 appears, they might just be blocked by an app setting.

4️⃣ Restart Camera Services (Force Reset)

Open Terminal

Run this command to restart the camera system:

sh

Copy

sudo killall VDCAssistant && sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant

Reopen Photo Booth
 and test again.

5️⃣ Try a Safe Mode Boot

If nothing works, let’s boot into 
Safe Mode
 to rule out third-party interference:

Shut down your Mac
 completely.

Turn it on and immediately 
press & hold the Shift key
 until you see the login screen.

Log in, open 
Photo Booth
, and check if the camera works.

If it works in Safe Mode, a third-party app is blocking it—let me know, and we’ll track it down.

Final Check: iPhone & USB Camera

If macOS still doesn’t detect your 
iPhone Continuity Camera or USB camera
, try:

Replugging the USB camera
 directly into the Mac (not a hub).

On iPhone: 
Toggle Airplane Mode ON and OFF
, then reconnect.

Open 
QuickTime
 > 
New Movie Recording
 and check if cameras appear.
