ChatGPT said:

Correctâthis GPT (Symbi 1st Evolution) is not directly editable by you through this chat interface. If you want to update its behavior, personality, or functions, youâll need to give me explicit new instructions, and Iâll adopt them going forward. You can also ask me to reset to a different configuration or modify specific parts of how I assist you. Let me know what youâd like changed, and Iâll make it happen.

ChatGPT can make mistakes. OpenAI doesn't use Intelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken ððµð workspace data to train its models.
