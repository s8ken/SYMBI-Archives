Biggest deltas:

Critical gaps:

I=E2=80=99m issuing an operational m=
andate across four lanes. This is not a checklist; it=E2=80=99s the critica=
l path.

1) Trust Core Completion (crypto + =
standards)

Signature verification:
 Implement JWS/JWT for VCs; suppor=
t Ed25519 & secp256k1; add deterministic tests against W3C VC examples.=

DID resolution service:
 Pluggable resolver for 
did:web
, 
did:key
, 
did:ethr
, 
did:ion
; cache + TTL; failure modes defined.

Revocation:
 StatusList2021 or equivalent; publish, rot=
ate, and verify; expose 
/trust/=
revocation-status
 endpoint.

Interoperability tests:
 Golden vectors for each DID me=
thod + VC proof; conformance suite gate in CI.

Risk model hooks:
 Penalties in scoring auto-trigger do=
wngrade + alerts on revoked/expired proofs.

2) Test & Release Hardening (=
raise from 2/10 =E2=86=92 =E2=89=A57/10)

Coverage target:
 70% overall; 
=E2=89=A585%
 on 
src/core/trust/*
.

Pyramids:
 unit (fast) =E2=86=92 property tests (scorin=
g invariants) =E2=86=92 integration (DID/VC lifecycle) =E2=86=92 e2e (agent=
 =E2=86=92 trust =E2=86=92 dashboard).

Attack suites:
 fuzz inputs for validator; mutation tes=
ts for policy bypass; red-team scripts for JWT misconfig, replay, and clock=
-skew.

Non-negotiable gates:
 No merge if trust package <85=
% coverage or any flaky test in CI.

3) Security & Deployment (rai=
se from 3/10 =E2=86=92 =E2=89=A57/10)

JWT hardening:
 rotate secrets; enforce 
aud/iss/kid
; short TTL; JTI replay cach=
e (Redis).

Secrets posture:
 one-way vault (no env in logs); per-s=
ervice keys; least-priv DB roles.

Containers:
 minimal base (distroless), read-only FS, s=
eccomp; SBOM + image signing (cosign); admission policy blocks unsigned ima=
ges.

Observability:
 trace trust flows (span attrs: agent_id=
, did_method, vc_status); anomaly alerts on score volatility & revocati=
ons.

SLA runbooks:
 fail-open vs fail-closed matrix for trus=
t endpoints; circuit breakers; chaos drills monthly.

4) Productization & GTM (conv=
ert moat =E2=86=92 revenue)

SKUs:

TaaS:
 per-verification, DID issuance, VC signing.

CaaS:
 audit packs + regulatory dashboards (EU AI Act, =
SOC2 controls mapping).

Marketplace:
 certification + insurance partner rails.

Enterprise:
 self-hosted trust protocol + unlimited age=
nts + compliance suite.

Trust Dashboard (pilot-grade):

Org view: TrustScore (w/ CI), revo=
cations, lineage of attestations.

Agent view: Articles compliance, r=
ecent proofs, anomaly history.

Export: signed reports (PDF + JSON=
-LD).
