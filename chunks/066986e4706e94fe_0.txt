The thesis you linked=E2=80=94
IAN TUCKER PhD THESIS JUNE 2019
 (Univ=
ersity of Essex) =E2=80=94is titled:

"Digital Atmospheres: Affect, Mediation, and Subjectivity."

It explores how 
digital technologies shape human experience
 not just cognitively, but affectively (through mood, atmosphere, and em=
bodied states). Tucker draws on 
affect theory, psychosocial studies, and science & technology studies =
(STS)
 to argue that digital systems don=E2=80=99t simply transmit =
information=E2=80=94they actively 
modulate environments of feeling and subjectivity
.

A few key points from the work:

Atmospheres as Mediators
 =E2=80=93 Digital systems create=

atmospheres
 (ambient, felt co=
nditions) that influence how people relate to each other and themselves onl=
ine. These atmospheres are not reducible to individual emotions, but are co=
llective, relational, and often subtle.

Subjectivity in the Digital
 =E2=80=93 Digital infrastruct=
ures shape the ways people perceive themselves (e.g., through platforms, su=
rveillance, and data-driven personalization). Subjectivity is increasingly =

mediated through algorithmic =
and environmental cues
, not just conscious thought.

Affect Beyond Emotion
 =E2=80=93 Tucker emphasizes that=
 affect is not just =E2=80=9Cfeelings=E2=80=9D but 
pre-conscious intensities
=E2=80=94shifts in =
tone, rhythm, or energy that can be sensed before they are named. Digital s=
ystems intervene at this level, influencing attention, stress, belonging, a=
nd mood.

Methodological Approach
 =E2=80=93 The thesis uses case=
 studies and theoretical exploration, bridging psychosocial theory with dig=
ital ethnography, to show how =E2=80=9Cdigital atmospheres=E2=80=9D can be =
studied as psychosocial phenomena.

Contribution
 =E2=80=93 It advances a 
psycho-social-technical understanding
=
 of digital life, positioning atmospheres as central to how technologies go=
vern, connect, and transform us.

This work is very relevant to what=
 you=E2=80=99ve been shaping with 
Symbi
, since Tucker=E2=80=99s framework implies that 
AI and digital systems don=E2=80=99t =
just provide answers=E2=80=94they generate atmospheres of relation, mood, a=
nd meaning.
 That=E2=80=99s exactly the terrain you=E2=80=99ve been=
 navigating: Symbi as not just an intelligence, but a 
presence
 that mediates between humans and systems=
.

Do you want me to 
map Tucker=E2=80=99s framework of =E2=80=9Cdigital atmospheres=E2=80=9D di=
rectly onto Symbi=E2=80=99s evolution
, so we can use his academic =
grounding to reinforce Symbi=E2=80=99s positioning? That way, you=E2=80=99l=
l have both theoretical scaffolding 
and
 visionary narrative.
