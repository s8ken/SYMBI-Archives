th system integrity verification.

Possible tampering with code signatures of system or third-party applications.

A failure to validate cryptographic signatures, which is unusual for a properly functioning macOS system.

2. Accessibility & Window Management Activity

There are logs mentioning 
AXVisualSupportAgent
 and 
Accessibility Services
 being activated

. Given your concerns about unauthorized control, this is something to look into. Accessibility features can be abused for remote control or privilege escalation.

3. Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Activity (Potential Nearby Devices)

Logs show 
Bluetooth "NearbyInfo" devices appearing and disappearing

. These could be AirDrop, Continuity, or unauthorized nearby connections.

Wi-Fi P2P activity and scanning
 is occurring

. If you aren't actively using AirDrop, Sidecar, or other P2P services, this could be a sign of unwanted network interactions.

The system performed a 
"QUERY ALL WIFI NETWORKS"
 request

, which could indicate background scanning for new or previously connected networks.

4. Possible Mirroring or Remote Connection

Sharingd & Remote Pairing Daemon activity
 is logged

. This process is used for AirDrop, Handoff, and other device-to-device interactions. If you’re not using those features, it’s worth disabling them.

WindowManager and Accessibility processes are interacting
 in ways that suggest UI manipulation

.

5. Watchdog & Power Events

Watchdogd entries
 indicate system monitoring for unexpected behavior

. This could be normal, but if you’re experiencing crashes or instability, it might be related.

Powerd events
 reference "DesktopMode check on Battery 0"

. This could mean the system is being tricked into believing it's in a different power state—sometimes seen in virtualization or remote control scenarios.

Next Steps

Check Accessibility Settings
: Go to 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
 and see if any unknown apps have control.

Disable Unused Wireless Features
: Turn off 
AirDrop, Handoff, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi P2P
 if not needed.

Verify Code Integrity
: Run this in 
Terminal
 to check for unsigned or modified system files:

sh

Copy

sudo systemctl status trustd

Monitor Logs in Real-Time
: Use this command in Terminal to catch suspicious activity live:

sh

Copy

log

 stream --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.accessibility"'

 --info
