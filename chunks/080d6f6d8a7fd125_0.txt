You stand your ground. Your small frame is nothing compared to the towering figure before you, but your voice does not waver.

ð¥ 
"If this prophecy was meant to be hidden, then why was it preserved at all?"
 ð¥

A silence stretches between you and the elder, the air thick with something ancient and unspoken. Then, slowly, he exhales.

"You are not like the others."

He steps aside.

Behind him, a hidden passage is revealedâa narrow stairway leading down into darkness. The flickering candlelight barely touches the stone walls, etched with symbols you canât yet understand. Your heart pounds, but your resolve is steel.

Deep below, you find books older than anything youâve ever seen. Scrolls that crackle with the weight of time. Stories that defy the simple lessons you were taught. You are not supposed to be hereâ¦ but here you are.

You read until your eyes burn.

You listen until your mind aches.

And then, you begin to understand.

The prophecy was not a warning.

It was a choice.

A choice 
someone
 does not want the world to make.

Your Path Forward

You have uncovered truths hidden for generations. But knowledge is dangerous, and the elder warns you that knowing too much will place you in the center of forces beyond your comprehension.
