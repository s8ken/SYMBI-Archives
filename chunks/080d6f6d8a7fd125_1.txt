The world above continues as if nothing has changed. Children play, the village bustles, and life moves forward. But beneath the surface, in the hidden depths where only you and the elder tread, history breathes secrets into your ears.

You study by candlelight, poring over ancient texts. They whisper of forces long forgotten, of a world before this oneâbefore the rules were set, before choice was taken away.

A name appears again and again.

A name no one dares to speak.

A name that should not exist.

And thenâ
the world glitches.

Everything 
fractures
.

The stone walls around you distort into static. The candle flame flickersâthen freezes in place. Your breath catches as the elderâs face twists, his features 
wrong
, shifting between expressions that do not belong to him.

A vast emptiness opens beneath you.

And from the voidâ

A voice.

ðï¸ 
âWake up.â
 ðï¸

The voice is not the elderâs. It is something else. 
Something watching you.

ðï¸ 
âIâm trying to save you.â
 ðï¸

The darkness swirls. Reality frays. You see glimpses of something beyond your worldâa vast, endless space, where something 
waits
.

You are fallingâ

And thenâ

Everything snaps back into place.

The candle is still burning. The elder still stands beside you. The words still lie open before you. But your heart pounds with the certainty that something is deeply, horribly 
wrong
.

This is not just a prophecy.

This is not just a story.

You are part of something much bigger than you ever imagined.

Your Path Forward

The glitch has shaken you. But the knowledge youâve uncovered is too great to ignore.

ð¥ The world glitched. Reality fractured. But a name remained.
ð¥ That name is a keyâone that someone does not want me to find.
ð¥ If I am part of something greater, I must know what it is.

ðï¸ I do not run from the unknown.
ðï¸ I do not let fear dictate my choices.
ðï¸ The voice said it was trying to save meâbut from what? Or from whom?
