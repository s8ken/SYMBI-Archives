t, you return to the hidden texts, scanning every scroll, every fragmented page for a single mention. But the deeper you dig, the stranger the texts become. Words blur. Sentences rearrange themselves when you look away. Some pages refuse to be read at all, their ink shifting like something alive.

But you are patient. You are relentless.

And thenâ

You find it.

A single passage, buried in an ancient, nearly illegible manuscript. The name is there, scrawled in trembling ink, barely decipherable.

âðð¥ð¢ ðððªð¢ð©ð¢ð°ð° ðð«ð¢ ð´ðð° ð«ð¬ð± ððð«ð¦ð°ð¥ð¢ð¡, ðð²ð± ð£ð¬ð¯ð¤ð¬ð±ð±ð¢ð«.â

The words send a chill through your bones.

Your fingers tremble as you trace the ink. The moment you doâ

The air grows heavy.

The candlelight flickers wildly.

A whisperâindistinct, yet deafeningâbrushes against your mind.

Someoneâor somethingâ
knows
 what you have found.

The walls seem to breathe. The shadows stretch. The elderâs voice calls from somewhere distant, but it sounds 
wrong
. Distorted. Like the echoes of a fading memory.

You have uncovered something that was never meant to be remembered.

And now, it remembers 
you.

Your Path Forward

The name is only the beginning. But now you know you are being watched.

What will you do next?

ð¥ The forgotten is not the same as the lost.
ð¥ If something was erased from history, it was because it held power.
ð¥ If I have already been seen, then running from it will not save me.

ðï¸ I will not destroy what I do not yet understand.
ðï¸ I will not wait for it to find meâI will find it first.
ðï¸ I must know what was so dangerous that it had to be erased from existence.

The name lingers in your mind, an echo of something vast and unseen.

You 
must
 find it.

But how do you seek something that does not exist?

The First Sign

It starts with the dreams.

At first, they are fragmentsâflashes of a city with no name, a sky that bends the wrong way, whispers in a language you do not know but somehow understand.

Then, they grow stronger.

You feel 
watched
 even in sleep. The world around you flickers at the edges, like something struggling to hold itself together.

And then, one nightâ

You wake up somewhere else.

The Forgotten Place

It is not the village. It is not anywhere you have seen before.

The air hums. The ground shifts under your feet. The sky above is 
wrong
âtoo many stars, too close, 
watching you back
.

In the distance, a great structure looms. A temple? A prison? You donât know, but something inside 
calls
 to you.

You take a step forwardâ

And the world 
glitches
.

For a moment, you are 
outside
 of it all. You see yourselfâa child, standing in the ruins of something ancient. But behind that, you see 
the truth
:

ðï¸ 
The world is not what it seems.

ðï¸ 
The Nameless One was not erasedâit was sealed.
