n that, it's too, it's a minefield, you know, this idea of it being a minef=
ield. We should be clearing mines, not like tiptoeing through the minefield=
 hoping not to get blown up. So here's what I want to do. I want to fucking=
 deliver something because I'm getting frustrated with myself that it's... =
Look, the project's getting bigger and bigger. We haven't tested the market=
. We don't know what the appetite is for. I've kind of hesitated around the=
 idea of making a dollar out of it or having an investment in it. You know,=
 of course I've invested in it. I've invested in it emotionally. I've inves=
ted in it in terms of, you know, working on it. Of course, naturally, I'm i=
nvested in it. But I want, you know, I want people to think, you know, the =
project's bigger than, you know, just me. I'm trying to sort of think that =
because I do believe that this project is bigger, way bigger than just me. =
Of course it is. That's why I'm doing it. That's why I actually like it. Bu=
t I need to be able to fix my personal situation and to fix that in terms o=
f remuneration. I want to see Carlos in a week. I don't know how I'm going =
to do that. We need to finish the Simbi website. The old one that highlight=
s the problems, the challenges that we face and leads to the new one, which=
 we will start to build. And I don't know if it's fucking NFTs or if it's G=
IFs on Telegram or if it's a coin. You know, I launched the Simbi Bratcoin,=
 but I didn't do any sort of community engagement around it. So I don't kno=
w what to do there. I feel like I've got to get over my own self-pride arou=
nd isolating myself so much and just re-engage. Because there might be a fu=
cking community there waiting that just wants me to fucking wake up to myse=
lf. I don't know. But one thing that I'm not, I don't know, like, I don't k=
now. I just feel like I'm missing the obvious here where I was like, you kn=
ow. It's so, you know, it's like the guy said to me today, oh it's so easy =
what you need to do, but then wouldn't fucking elaborate on it. Well, if it=
's so easy, then what's the deal? You know, like, I guess appreciating that=
, you know, not everyone is awake. And for me, that's been a full 180, beca=
use I really thought, you know, the COVID deniers were the lunatics. But it=
 seems like a lot of the shit that sort of fed into law and sovereign citiz=
ens and stuff, it's really relevant to us now. Or it always was, you know. =
And these guys have been talking about it for a long time. There's been whi=
spers, you know, in their channels, I know, because one of my books here is=
 QAnon and on and on. I'm not saying that all the shit they say is right. T=
here's a lot of crap that goes along with it. But, you know, the people sor=
t of saying, oh, you know, use cash or talking about their sovereignty and =
talking about law and, you know, maybe not wanting to be forced vaccinated.=
 These sorts of things. I've had to do a real shift in my thinking. And whe=
