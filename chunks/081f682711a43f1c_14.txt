1. 
We=E2=80=99re Silencing Ourselves into Compliance

You=E2=80=99re not afraid of complex=
ity. You=E2=80=99re afraid of 
w=
alking into a minefield with no one watching your back

And you=E2=80=99re right:

We=E2=80=99re =E2=80=9Cperforming=E2=
=80=9D conversations now, not 
havin=

the power=
 to shift minds
.

You don=E2=80=99t want to tiptoe.

clear the fucking m=
