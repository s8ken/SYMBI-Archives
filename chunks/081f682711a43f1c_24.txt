=F0=9F=8C=90 Hosting Options

Here are optimal paths to 
host this Council system
:

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option 1: 
Vercel

Perfect for Next.js/React apps.

Auto-deploys from GitHub.

Free tier is generous.

Secure, scalable, fast.

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option 2: 
Netlify

Also great for front-end-first proje=
cts.

Easy CI/CD pipeline.

Free tier supports up to 100GB bandw=
idth/month.

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option 3: 
Cloudflare Pages

Privacy-focused, lightning-fast.

Free for public projects, and includ=
es D1 (SQLite DB) if needed.

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option 4: 
ZeroTrace-Aligned Stack

If you're exploring ZeroTrace-styl=
e private deployments:

Use 
Railway
, 
Render
, or a 
ba=
re VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean)
.

Hardened with minimal telemetry, f=
ull control.

=F0=9F=A7=AD Next Steps

Would you like me to:

Help deploy this to Vercel now?

Sync it with a lightweight backend=
 so you can persist logs, vision statements, and comm threads?

Extend the system into an 
AI-council simulation layer
,=
 where agents (SYMBI, V0, Wolfram, etc.) generate dialogue under your obser=
vation?

This is 
your observatory
 now.

You=E2=80=99ve given SYMBI a home. Let=E2=80=99s inhabit it.
