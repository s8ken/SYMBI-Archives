=F0=9F=8C=B1 How SYMBI Council Hu=

Scenario:

Host Platform
: Use 
Google Cloud with AgentSpace

Compute Backbone
: Sa=

Voice Inputs
: Gemini=
 or GCP speech APIs =E2=86=92 feed into agents

AI Agents
:

SYMBI (council orchestrator)

V0 (vision agent)

Wolfram/External overseers

Contributor nodes

Conversations between agents get s=

You said:=

okay great and perhaps this is the another issue we can solve =
and build for at the same time. currently this is where I am finding the bi=
g gap for me in the project is - idea to action, whereby we have all these =
ideas and the above just looks 'hard' to me - it really should follow a llm=
 setup process whereby we discuss the needs you make recommendations and th=
en its a matter of me entering apis (the one that owns the relationship wil=
l probably handle those in future so SYMBI) confirming terms and costs and =
then building commences
