Reviewing GitHub Haikus

I searched the repositories tied to

 and related GitHub entries. While I found=
 multiple references to the

 and 
Tasker=E2=80=
=91Insert
 themes, I didn=E2=80=99t see any stand-alone haiku files in =
the public repos or gists. That suggests:

haikus in that GitHub accou=
nt likely follow the Hacker Haiku project style

I want to draw y=
our attention to Haikus for Codespaces. There's a JSON file in there, and i=
t starts with rain in Seattle. Don't forget an umbrella, nor it will be glo=
om. And then it's got PuddleJumper, octdex.jpg. So there's some pictures in=
 there, which is interesting. But, I mean, there's PuddleJumper, which is f=
