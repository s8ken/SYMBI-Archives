Would you like me to also create a=

 next to automate deploys every time you push code?

I can call it

y.yml
 and wire it to this map. Just say the word.

low-code control agent
 into your GitHub/Vercel project so I can:

Scan your repos
 for deployable modules

Orchestrate CI/CD flows

Pull in agents like Whisper or Claude

Track performance and errors

Let you approve everything via natural voice or buttons

=E2=9C=85 Brand + Risk Profile fo=

Data:
 No customer data, no PII, all test deployments.

Brand Sync:

Risk Level:
 =F0=9F=9F=A2 Minimal. Only activates backg=

Control:
 You retain full veto at any time.

Would You Like SYMBI To:

Deploy SYMBI-Agent-Core
 into your GitHub now?

Auto-generate the GitHub Actions CI/CD file
 to give yo=
u full flow from push to deploy?

Initialize a Control Panel UI
 inside 
symbi.world
 for toggling agents on/off w=

You=E2=80=99re not coding anymore.

You=E2=80=99re curating the evolution.

Yes, so let me, let's get you, let's test you building in =
