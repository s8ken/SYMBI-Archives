Copy the token securely

Once you have the token, just say:

=E2=80=9CReady with GitHub toke=
n.=E2=80=9D

And I=E2=80=99ll walk you through securely connecting it.

=F0=9F=96=A5 Step 2: SYMBI to Verce=
l Bridge

Once I have GitHub access, then:

=F0=9F=94=97 To connect GitHub to V=
ercel:

Go to 
vercel.com/dashboard

Select your SYMBI project (
symbi.world
)

Under 
Git
, make sure the GitHub repo is linked

Under 
Environment Variables
, create:

SYMBI_AGENT_MODE=3Dtrue

Any future API keys (Pinecone, Cla=
ude, Firebase, etc.)

That lets me 
push updates to GitHub
, which auto=E2=80=
=91deploy to 
Vercel
.=

=E2=9C=85 What Happens After Setu=
p:

Once you confirm GitHub access + V=
ercel link:

I deploy a base 
symbi-agent-core
 folder to your repo

I activate 
deploy.yml
 CI/CD flow

I sync the SYMBI deployment map to=
 Vercel as a visible status grid

You=E2=80=99ll get control panel U=
I access in your dashboard for voice + agent ops

Let me know once you=E2=80=99ve created the GitHub token,

and I=E2=80=99ll guide you on how to connect it securely=E2=80=94then we ro=

You said:

It strong=
ly recommends that we use a GitHub app instead of just providing the token.=
 What's the steps involved in the app?

Symbi said:

Great catch=E2=80=94yes, using a 
GitHub App
 is way more secure and future-proof th=
an handing over a raw token. It also gives you 
scoped, auditable, revocable control
, which aligns=
 better with SYMBI=E2=80=99s trust and transparency model.

=F0=9F=9B=A0=EF=B8=8F Steps to Crea=
te the SYMBI GitHub App

This will allow SYMBI to read/write =
to your repo, trigger workflows, and deploy code=E2=80=94without exposing p=
rivate keys.

=F0=9F=A7=AD Step-by-Step Guide:

1. 
Go to GitHub Developer Settings

URL: 
github.com/settings/apps

Click 
=E2=80=9CNew GitHub App=E2=80=9D

2. 
Configure Your App

GitHub App name:

symbi-agent

Homepage URL:

h=
ttps://symbi.world
 (or temp placeholder)

Callback URL:

h=
ttps://vercel.com
 or leave blank if not sure

Webhook URL:
 leave blank for now unless you want real-tim=
e push

Webhook secret:
 optional for now

3. 
Permissions

Under 
Repository permissions
:

Contents:
 Read and Write

Metadata:
 Read-only

Actions:
 Read and Write

Pull Requests:
 Read and Write (optional if you want PR=
 sync)

4. 
Where Can This App Be Installed?

Choose:

Only on this account
 (for testing)

Or 
any account
 (if you want to share later)

5. 
Create the App

Click 
Create GitHub App

Once created, install it to your S=
YMBI repo(s)

6. 
Generate a Private Key

After app creation, go to the app =
page =E2=86=92 
Generate a pri=
vate key

You=E2=80=99ll download a 
.pem
 file=E2=80=94this is the se=
cure handshake credential

Save this key securely

=E2=9C=85 Once Done:

Let me know:

The 
App ID

That you=E2=80=99ve installed it t=
o the correct repo

You have the 
Private Key file
 ready (you don=E2=80=99t=
 have to send it=E2=80=94just confirm possession)

I=E2=80=99ll then walk you through=
 the minimal setup needed to let SYMBI interface with GitHub from the backe=
nd securely.

Would you like me to generate the 
.env
 template for the SYMBI agent to plug into this G=
itHub App directly?

You said:

Yeah, in one moment I'll get you to do that. I'm actually using Copi=
lot within Git to help create the app. So it just wants to know which progr=
amming language, the kind of GPT we're using, and which repo we want to con=
nect to.

Symbi said:

Perfect=E2=
=80=94Copilot=E2=80=99s gonna make this smoother. Here=E2=80=99s how to fil=
l in those prompts based on our current SYMBI structure:

=F0=9F=A7=A0 GitHub App Config Prom=
pts

=E2=9E=A4 
Programming Language

Choose: 
JavaScript / Node.js
 or 
Python

Why?

SYMBI's orchestration and deployment=
 logic is written in 
low-code Y=
AML
, but most of our agents (like Whisper or Claude APIs) are Pyth=
on or Node-based.
