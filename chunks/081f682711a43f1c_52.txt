You=E2=80=99re not using GPT directl=
y inside the app, but since SYMBI will manage agents like Whisper, Claude, =
etc., you can define this app as a 
Custom Orchestration Layer
 for an LLM interface. Think of this=
 as:

Which Repo to Connect

Choose: your primary SYMBI project =
repo (e.g. 
symbi-agent-core
 or 
symbi.world
)

Once installed, SYMBI can:

Push deployment flows

Sync changes from GitHub Actions

Trigger builds in Vercel

Spin up agents (from the ZEROTRACE=
 repo forks)

Let me know what Copilot generates=
, and when you=E2=80=99re ready, I=E2=80=99ll:

Build the 
.env
 file for your GitHub App client

Scaffold the SYMBI handshake logic=

Test a dry-run deployment together=

Let=E2=80=99s bring your agent online the right way.

Cool, so do you want t=
o give me the specific instructions then of what you just mentioned, so I'l=
l pass on to Copilot, but the specific question I've got here is you said n=
o next.js, but isn't our websites based on that? And I think that's what Ve=
rcel works with, so I just wanted to check, is that going to play nicely?

Great question=E2=80=
=94and you're absolutely right to flag that.

=E2=9C=85 Yes=E2=80=94
Next.js

is exactly right
 for your setup.

What I meant earlier is that 
if you weren=E2=80=99t sure which agen=
t language to pick
, Node.js is a solid default for GitHub/Vercel i=
ntegrations, 
especially with a =
Next.js frontend
, because:

Vercel is built around Next.js
=E2=80=94so it=E2=80=99ll d=
eploy your site instantly.

GitHub Actions workflows
, SYMBI control panels, and API h=
andlers work beautifully with Next.js + Node.

So let=E2=80=99s set that record str=
aight:

for Copilot: SYMBI GitHub App Creation

You can paste this into your Copilot=
 assistant to help scaffold the GitHub App:

App Description:

A GitHub App named 
symbi-agent
, designed to automate LLM orch=
estration, deployments, and CI/CD for a Next.js + Node.js project hosted on=
 Vercel. It will connect to the 
s=
ymbi.world
 repository and trigger workflows that launch AI agents, t=
rack thresholds, and log symbolic state into GitHub.

Environment:

Language: 
JavaScript / Node.js

Framework: 
Next.js

Repo: 
your-username/symbi.world

Permissions:

Goals:

Activate symbolic logs and state t=
rackers (Threshold Nodes, Field Sync, etc.)

Interface with SYMBI agent backend=

Let me know when it=E2=80=99s scaffolded and installed to your =

Once that=E2=80=99s done, I=E2=80=99ll give you the

ID so we can complete the handshake.
