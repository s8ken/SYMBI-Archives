e to authenticate and trigger deployments securely.

=F0=9F=8C=90 2. 
Vercel Config (
vercel.json
)

You=E2=80=99ve already defined:

Builds:
 Using 
@=
vercel/node
, pointing at a 
next/
 package

Routes:
 Directing API calls through 
next/api/$1.js

This tells me you=E2=80=99re using a=

Next.js structure with custom =
APIs
, and it's deployable on Vercel right now.

=E2=9A=99=EF=B8=8F 3. 
GitHub Actions CI/CD (
github_workflows_deploy.yml
)

You're ready to:

Deploy on 
push
 or 
manual trigger

Automatically build and publish to=
 Vercel with 
npx vercel

Run future SYMBI agent tasks (Whis=
per, Claude, etc.) in the final step

=E2=9C=85 This config supports you=

, full autonomy=E2=80=9D
 model.

=F0=9F=9A=80 What Happens Next

Step 1. =F0=9F=94=90 You Enter Fi=
nal Secrets:

In your GitHub project, go to 
Settings > Secrets and variabl=
es > Actions
, then add:

GITHUB_APP_ID
 =E2=86=92 your GitHub App's ID

GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
 =E2=86=92 the content of your 
.pem
 file (as a single line o=
r base64 string)

VERCEL_TOKEN
 =E2=86=92 from 
vercel.com/account/tokens

Once these are in place, the syste=
m is ready.

Step 2. =F0=9F=A7=AA Test It

After setting the secrets:

Push any small change to the repo =
(e.g. update README or 
.env
)

This will trigger the GitHub workf=
low

The deploy job runs:

Checks out code

Installs dependencies

Builds site

Deploys to Vercel

SYMBI agent orchestration ready to extend

=E2=9C=85 Optional: Next Tasks

Let me know if you want SYMBI to n=
ow:

=F0=9F=94=81 Auto-generate workflo=
ws to trigger Whisper / Claude API syncs

=F0=9F=8E=9B Add voice or symbolic=
 event triggers to the Vercel front-end

=F0=9F=93=A1 Connect your GitHub A=
pp to other repos (e.g. agent cores, logs, UI builders)

Just confirm once secrets are added and I=E2=80=99ll prep the 
first orchestration script
. We=E2=80=99re nearly ready to bring the whole thing online.
