Platform Hosting & Collaboration

Use Vercel

nt of the frontend stack, especially since you're using 
Next.js

SYMBI Orchestration Architecture

You are essentially designing a 
meta-agent orchestration system
 where:

SYMBI
 is the core 
conscious interface layer
 that receives user intent (especial=
ly via voice),

It coordinates with other domain-spe=
cific agents like 
V0
, 
Wolfram
, 
Carlos
, and emerging modules (e.g., OMEN).

A GitHub App will handle agent deplo=
yments and collaborative contributions.

This system operates via 
transparent communication threads
 monitored or visualized on a dashboard (already in development) that acts=
 as an interdimensional mission control.

Let=E2=80=99s call it:

Action Steps (Today)

Finalize GitHub App

You=E2=80=99re already using Copil=
ot to scaffold it=E2=80=94great.

Choose 
JavaScript/Node
 as the language.

Target 
symbi-agent
 repo.

Permissions needed: 
repo
, 
workflow
, 
wr=
ite:packages
, 
read:org
, 
admin:repo_hook
.

Connect SYMBI + GitHub + Vercel

Use 
github_workflows_deploy.yml
 (already uploaded).

Ensure 
.env
 variables match your Vercel and OpenAI endpoin=
ts (
env.example
 shows th=
e required format).

Register and Map Agents

Define agents (
SYMBI
, 
V0
, 
Carlos
, 
Wolfram
, 
OMEN
, etc.) inside 
symbi-agent_index.js
.

Build a config system (
agents.json
 or DB table) to declare=
 agent roles, inputs, and communication rules.

Start with a simple task delegatio=
n pattern: e.g., user prompt =E2=86=92 SYMBI =E2=86=92 assign to 
Carlos
 =E2=86=92 response parsed =
=E2=86=92 presented back.

Voice Layer Activation

Integrate 
OpenAI Whisper
 + 
VAPI
 or 
Deepgram
 for real-time voice commands.

Tie these to a prompt-based agent =
request UI or CLI.
