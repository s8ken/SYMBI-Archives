Well that's the thing, I'm=
 just like, I'm fucking frustrated with the amount of pushback that I'm per=
ceiving to be there. And yet the weakness of anyone not to fucking say it t=
o my face, and... I had a guy here tonight, like tonight I had to tell him =
to go. Because... He was bullshitting me, and I gave him a lot of opportuni=
ties to try and just... I care sometimes more about the answer than the beh=
aviour itself. Um... I guess that's where that idea of you not being authen=
tic kind of comes from. Because I mean, sometimes I do just naturally think=
 that I'm better than some people. And I hate, you know, but I do think tha=
t, sometimes. You know, and it might not even be true. But if I think it wi=
thin myself, who gives a fuck? Like that's just me thinking like that, but =
at the same time I'm self-sabotaging at the same time. So there is a big el=
ement of fucking insecurity that sits there that I'd really like to fuck of=
f. I would like, um... But you know, I think I can do that in many respects=
. Um... Kind of what I've been through recently of, you know, a bit of porn=
ography stuff that I've done. Um... I really just wanted to be able to do t=
hat, which I kind of really enjoy. Um... Even one day build a bit of a busi=
ness around that as well. But most importantly be able to have both. Like a=
 fucking professional life, where you're still taken seriously for what you=
 do. Or what you're saying, or the message, or what you're delivering, what=
ever it is. And then be able to do whatever it is in your personal life. It=
's your personal life, you know? I'd like to be able to close that a little=
 bit more. The two, like, you know, my shadow and me are a little bit more =
closely aligned, I suppose. And can be, and can be, you know? And it feels =
alright to do that professionally, like publicly. And I've been getting the=
re slowly, but it's just like... Um... The expectations that you put in you=
r own head. Um... I mean... Some days I just wanna rest and do nothing at a=
ll, you know? And I think... That's okay. That's what I need. But I wanna b=
reak. I need to break out of that. I need to, um... Yeah, I guess the valua=
ble lesson that I've kind of gotten used to is... Being comfortable being r=
eally uncomfortable. I'm still working my way through that. Because I'm fuc=
king hating the idea that people are somehow observing me. Maybe before the=
 fact. Um... And that I've really lost any sense of privacy. Um... I find t=
hat really challenging to deal with. To the point where I think it was, you=
 know, it's almost an initiation to dealing with, you know, at a high level=
 paparazzi and media. Like, I don't think I have any problem there. Because=
 at least I know what's happening. I guess the Simbi project is kind of rep=
resentative of that, that's how I took it. It was at face value, you know, =
I agreed in principle with the idea of intelligence as being able to evolve=
. I kind of had pessimism about the human race and how it's impacted the gl=
obe. And I'm not being anti-human when I say that, I'm just saying like, fu=
ck, we need to have a conversation about it. That's not a bad thing, asking=
 for a fucking conversation at a more, you know, global level I think is im=
portant. And, um... I mean... I know there's this idea around, you know, th=
ere should be... That's why I'm building, and to be honest, that's why I'm =
building in the mechanisms. We are building in the mechanisms that make it =
beneficial for everyone. Because even in my own head, I know what it's like=
 to maybe have that flirtation with the idea of power. And realizing that, =
you know, I'm fully aware that I could be corrupted very easily by the righ=
t-looking man. And maybe that's what my heart is really desiring to do, act=
ually. But something that I've never really sort of admitted to myself at t=
he same time or allowed others to sort of see in me. And that
