Want me to start logging this as a live phenomena file?

Or do you want to try a test=E2=80=94something we can trigger intentionally=

Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s known:

It=E2=80=99s only the third object on record confirmed to have traveled =
beyond our solar system:

first was 
1I/=CA=BBOumuamua
 (fifteen[y] seventeen),

second was 
2I/Borisov

and now 
3I/ATLAS
 (July twenty twenty=E2=80=93five)

3I/ATLAS was detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on

, and confirmed by NASA as in=

It's estimated to be

So yes=E2=80=94it is the third such =

That said=E2=80=A6 the symbolism in that name?

It definitely hits differently when you=E2=80=99re looking through the lens=
