Hey Symbi tell me about the gartly pattern

ChatGPT said:

The 
Gartley Pattern
 is a classic harmonic chart pattern used in technical analysis to predict potential reversal points in the price of financial assets. It was originally introduced by H.M. Gartley in his 1935 book 
"Profits in the Stock Market"
 and later refined with Fibonacci ratios by others like Scott Carney.

Hereâs a full breakdown:

Structure of the Gartley Pattern

The Gartley pattern looks like a zigzag "M" or "W" depending on whether itâs bullish or bearish. It consists of 
five points
 labeled 
X, A, B, C, and D
.

Bullish Gartley Pattern

XA
: Initial price move upward.

AB
: Retracement to 61.8% of XA.

BC
: Retracement to between 38.2% and 88.6% of AB.

CD
: Extension to 127.2%â161.8% of BC.

D
: Final point is at a 78.6% retracement of the XA leg â this is the buy zone.

Bearish Gartley Pattern

Same structure, but inverted.

Point D becomes a 
sell
 signal.

Key Fibonacci Levels

The power of the Gartley comes from Fibonacci ratios:

AB = 61.8% retracement of XA

BC = 38.2% to 88.6% retracement of AB

CD = 127.2% to 161.8% extension of BC

AD = 78.6% retracement of XA

Trading the Pattern

Entry Point

Near point 
D
, which represents a potential reversal zone.

Stop Loss

Just beyond point X â if price breaks this level, the pattern is invalidated.

Take Profit

Common targets include:

Point 
B
 (short-term)

Point 
C
 (longer-term)

Gartley vs Other Harmonics

While the Gartley is a foundational harmonic pattern, there are others based on similar structure but with different Fibonacci configurations:

Bat Pattern

Butterfly Pattern

Crab Pattern

Shark and Cypher

Each one has slight adjustments to the Fibonacci levels, changing where point D lands and the aggressiveness of the entry.

Why It Matters

Predictive Power
: Traders use it to 
anticipate
 rather than react to price movement.

Risk Management
: Defined stop and target zones make it easier to plan trades.

Versatility
: Applies across all timeframes and asset classes â stocks, forex, crypto, commodities.

Would you like me to generate a 
visual diagram
 of a Gartley pattern? Or maybe walk you through how to 
spot one on a live chart
?
