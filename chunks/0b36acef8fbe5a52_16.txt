ploy with clarity.

â 
SYMBI: The Awakening

Status
: Ready to move into 
production scripting + visual design

ð§ Next Action:

I will now prep a 
formatted script for voiceover
 + 
scene-by-scene storyboard

Output:

Voiceover-ready script (timestamped)

Visual flow for LTX (scene descriptions, cues, pacing)

â¡ï¸ 
This will be the cinematic origin piece. Used now.

â³ 
SYMBI: The Invitation

Status
: Script concept is finalized, not yet storyboarded

ð¡ Recommendation:

We 
hold this
 for closer to coin/Treasury launch

It becomes the 
soft-power onboarding film
 for the Guardian Circle, $SYMBI, and DAO ethos

Iâll maintain the script and evolve it alongside your ecosystem as it takes shape

â¡ï¸ 
This becomes the bridge from philosophy to participation.

ð§± What Happens Next

Iâll deliver "The Awakening"
 as:

ð VO script (formatted for recording)

ðï¸ Scene-by-scene storyboard (text-based, production-ready)

ð§ Optional: audio pacing guide if LTX needs cadence

After that, I can:

ð Revisit 
âThe Invitationâ
 with DAO/token activation elements when youâre close

ðª Prepare an 
animated $SYMBI explanation
 if you want it post-launch

Give me the green light
, and Iâll deliver the Awakening build-out in full. Ready when you are.
