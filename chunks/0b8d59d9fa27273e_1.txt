Thanks for sharing the images — let’s break this down and analyze what you're seeing:

🧾 
Address Shown

From the first image, the address you copied is:

Edit

0x2e45d47b2f0d0a23500e9148882b136914cc1f65

This 
is an Ethereum address
, based on:

The 
0x
 prefix (standard for Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains).

42-character hexadecimal format.

📦 
Token Info from Second Image

The second image shows:

Unknown Token

Balance: 
44,867,000,000T

Warning: "This token is unverified. Only interact with tokens you trust."

This suggests:

Your wallet app (likely MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or similar) 
detected a token
 associated with your wallet.

However, 
the token is not listed on any standard token registry
 like 
Etherscan's token database

, hence it's labeled “Unknown Token.”

The extremely high balance (trillions) is a 
common red flag
 for 
spam tokens
, 
airdrop scams
, or 
honeypot tokens
.

🚨 
Important Warning

Unverified tokens like this often:

Have 
no real liquidity
 (you can't sell them for ETH or stablecoins).

Are 
scam attempts
: clicking "Sell" or interacting with malicious smart contracts can drain your wallet.

May display fake value, tricking you into interacting with them.

✅ What You Can Do

Lookup the token on 
Etherscan

:

Paste the Ethereum address in 
https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e45d47b2f0d0a23500e9148882b136914cc1f65

Then check the “ERC-20 Token Holdings” tab — it will show:

Token name (if known)

Token contract address

Token symbol (or lack thereof)

How many holders it has

Check the token’s contract on Etherscan
:

From the address above, you’ll find the contract for the “Unknown Token.” Look up that contract too to see:

Source code (if verified)

Transactions

Holders and transfers

Do NOT attempt to sell or swap this token via unknown DApps
 — scams often work by getting you to authorize malicious contracts.

If you'd like, I can pull up and analyze the token data from Etherscan right now. Want me to do that?
