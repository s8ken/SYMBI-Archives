 or

Thanks — that Etherscan link shows the 
BTCMTX token
 (Bitcoin MetaX) held by your Ethereum address:

Wallet:

0x2e45d47b2f0d0a23500e9148882b136914cc1f65

Token contract:

0xb11dB272EbfABEdf611a07684e82165dB60dC70E

Let’s break down the findings:

🔍 BTCMTX Token Details (from Etherscan)

Name:
 Bitcoin MetaX

Symbol:
 BTCMTX

Decimals:
 9

Total Supply:
 1 Quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000 BTCMTX)

Holders:
 Very few (likely just airdropped)

Creator Address:
 Contract creator is different from the Uniswap pool deployer

Contract Verified:
 ❌ 
No
 — code is 
not verified
, which is a 
major red flag

⚠️ Red Flags

🔒 
Unverified contract
 — no one can inspect what the token actually does.

🧃 
Fake liquidity
 — pool exists, but token likely has no actual buy/sell support.

💰 
Enormous balance
 (hundreds of billions or trillions) is 
meaningless
 — artificially inflated to make it look valuable.

👻 
No price
, 
no market cap
, 
no trade history
 — indicates this is 
not a real or supported project
.

✅ Final Verdict

BTCMTX is worthless.

It is a textbook example of a 
vanity scam or airdrop trap token
.

Do 
not
 interact with the token (e.g., swap, approve, or transfer).

You can 
safely hide it
 in your wallet interface.

If you're worried about security, I can show you how to:

Revoke any token 
approvals

Or even 
sweep funds to a fresh wallet

Let me know if you'd like help with that or want me to scan any other wallet or token.

haha just like this https://netgamenv.com/book-of-nile-magic-choice/

Haha yes — 
exactly like that!

That link you shared (to a flashy online slot game like "Book of Nile: Magic Choice") is a perfect metaphor:

🎰 
BTCMTX and similar scam tokens
 are like:

A slot machine that 
shows a big jackpot
…

…but 
never pays out
 — or worse, 
charges you to spin.

They tempt you with:

Ridiculously high balances

Fake "liquidity"

And sometimes a UI that looks polished but hides shady mechanics behind the scenes

🛡️ TL;DR:

Just like a shady casino:

The house always wins

And if it seems 
too good to be true
, it 100% is in crypto

Always a good laugh 
after
 you avoid the trap 😄

Let me know if you want help reviewing other tokens or wallet security.

 the player can pick one or more among 9 symbols, which will transform into a special Expanded Symbol, and get up to 10 Free Spins.

Ah, now you're diving into 
game mechanics
 — and that sounds like a fun breakdown of the 
"Book of Nile: Magic Choice"
 slot feature!

Here’s what you’re describing:

🎮 
Magic Choice Feature Breakdown

9 Symbols Available
: Likely standard slot symbols (e.g., 10, J, Q, K, A, characters, etc.)

Player Chooses
: 1 or more of these to become 
Special Expanding Symbols

Special Expanded Symbol
:

When chosen and triggered during Free Spins, it 
expands to cover the full reel

Pays 
even on non-adjacent reels
, increasing win chances

🔁 
Free Spins

Player can win 
up to 10 Free Spins

During these spins, the chosen special symbol(s) 
expands whenever they appear

This mechanic is inspired by classic 
Book of Ra-style
 slots (popular in many games)

🎯 Strategy Element

This variation gives a 
slightly more skillful edge
 than regular “Book of…” slots:

You 
choose your special symbols

You can go for 
low-paying but frequent symbols
, or 
high-paying rare ones

Want to simulate the 
probabilities or payouts
 for different choices? I can model it using Wolfram's probability engine if you want a breakdown like:

Expected return based on number of symbols chosen

Odds of hitting full-screen expansions

Optimal symbol choice strategies (risk vs. reward)

Just let me know! 🎲💡
