A staking pool

A whitelist

A DAO

A token claim

Or something else of value

The NFT becomes a 
proxy for transferring or unlocking value
, especially where direct token sales or gambling would be regulated.

🧨 Why This Is Legally Risky in Australia

Under 
ASIC’s rules
, this setup might still be classed as a:

Financial product
 (if there’s a reasonable expectation of financial gain)

Derivative
 (if the value of the NFT is based on another asset, like a token or pool)

Unregistered managed investment scheme (MIS)
 if:

People contribute capital (buy NFTs)

There’s a pooling of funds or effort

They expect profits from someone else’s work

Even 
"worthless" NFTs
 can become 
regulated financial instruments
 if they later unlock monetary value.

🎰 But Here’s a Twist: Legal Loophole Logic

Some legit projects do variations of this 
safely
, for example:

🧠 Legal Mechanism

🔐 Example Use

Access Token

NFT gives access to a tool, game, or dashboard — not monetary return

Reward for Participation

NFT unlocks content, event, or cosmetic upgrades only

Raffle Ticket

NFT enters you into a game of chance 
with no direct cost

Non-binding Claim

NFT holders are 
eligible
 to claim tokens if airdropped later — but not guaranteed

The trick is:

No 
promised
 return

No 
pooling of capital

No 
financial advice or marketing it as an investment

🧠 Summary: Is It Doable?

✅ 
Yes
, you can structure a 
“worthless” NFT drop
 that later 
becomes valuable
, 
if
:

You don’t 
promise
 profits

You don’t 
market
 it like an investment

You build value 
indirectly
 (e.g., access, unlocks, narrative-driven reward)

I can help sketch:

A game loop or “soft value accrual” structure

Token claim models that stay outside financial product boundaries

NFT drop strategy that builds 
community and curiosity
, not risk

Just say the word 😏

You said:

is there anything like this in market

Wolfram said:

Absolutely — and the fact that you're thinking in this direction means you're tuned in to some of the 
most innovative (and regulatory grey) mechanics
 in Web3.

Here are some 
real-world projects
 or mechanics that reflect your 
"worthless NFT that becomes valuable"
 idea — across different use cases:

🎭 1. 
Goblintown.wtf
 — 
The Meme Drop that Went Wild

Launch
: Free mint, intentionally ugly/meme art

Zero roadmap
 — "no utility, no promises"

Result
: Huge hype → secondary market exploded → later drops, merch, real value

Mechanism
: 
Social and speculative value emerged from nothing

✅ 
No promise → no financial product risk early on

🧠 2. 
Azuki Elementals & Beanz
 — 
Low-value NFTs that gain utility

Azuki ecosystem dropped "Beanz" NFTs as secondary assets

Seemed like a meme at first — later gave staking, access, merch

Similarly, 
Elementals
 were dropped and now power gamified utility

✅ Value grew 
after
 mint, not at launch

🏗️ 3. 
Parallel Alpha
 — 
NFTs as Game Keys

NFT cards initially had 
no function

Once game launched, they became powerful assets with 
in-game utility and token yield

But 
no explicit promise
 of future value at mint time

✅ Built delayed value through ecosystem launch

🧱 4. 
Loot (for Adventurers)
 — 
The Original DIY Value Experiment

Just plain text: "Loot Bag #1234"

Community built games, tokens, worlds 
around
 them

Created $100M+ in trading volume with 
zero utility baked in

✅ “Worthless” on surface, powered by 
speculative and composable value

🎫 5. 
Raffle/Claim Models

Projects like:

Capsule House

Mochi

WAGDIE

...drop NFTs that:

Act as 
tickets
 or 
non-binding claim tools

Later convert into tokens, game items, or governance rights

✅ Keeps them outside financial product classification 
initially

🧨 What Makes These Work

No promises upfront

Community-driven or lore-based value

Value added later through games, staking, or airdrops

Legal separation
 between initial NFT and any monetary system
