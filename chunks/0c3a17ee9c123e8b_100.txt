)
}

✅ Step 2: Save the file and re-run your dev server

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Once that's done, the 
getPage()
 import in 
app/page.tsx
 will resolve correctly, and your CMS data should start flowing into your frontend.

Let me know once it’s reloaded or if you want help rendering that 
title
 or 
content
 from Sanity in the layout!

Thanks for confirming — this tells us that either:

The 
getPage
 function is 
missing
 from your 
lib/sanity.ts
 file, or

It exists but is 
not being exported properly
, or

There's a 
path resolution issue
 with the alias 
@/lib/sanity
.

Let's go through each possible fix:

✅ Fix 1: Ensure 
getPage
 is defined and exported

Open 
lib/sanity.ts
 and 
ensure the file looks like this
:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient, groq } 

from

"next-sanity"

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

, 

// ✅ your real project ID

dataset

: 

"production"

,

apiVersion

: 

"2023-01-01"

,

useCdn

: 

true

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

 client.

fetch

(
    groq
`*[_type == "page"][0]{
      title,
      content
    }`

  )
}

✅ Fix 2: Restart the dev server

If you just added or edited that export, make sure to restart your dev server:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ Fix 3: Confirm path alias resolution (
@/lib/sanity
)

Make sure that the 
tsconfig.json
 (or 
jsconfig.json
) in your project root includes the 
@
 alias like this:

json

Copy

{

"compilerOptions"

:

{

"baseUrl"

:

"."

,

"paths"

:

{

"@/*"

:

[

"./*"

]

}

}

}

Then 
restart the TypeScript server
 (or VS Code), and restart your dev server again.

Let me know if you’d like me to help check the contents of 
lib/sanity.ts
 again — just paste it in here and I’ll verify it’s all good.

You said:

yeah just tell me how to find it agaijn

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Sure thing! Here’s how to find and open the 
lib/sanity.ts
 file step by step:

🧭 Navigate to the File in Terminal

Assuming you’re in your 
symbi-main-site
 project folder:

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site/lib

If the 
lib
 folder doesn’t exist yet, you can create it:

bash

Copy

mkdir

 -p ~/Documents/symbi-main-site/lib

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site/lib

✏️ Open or Create the File with 
nano

To open or create the file in the terminal:

bash

Copy

nano sanity.ts

Then paste the following into the editor:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient, groq } 

from

"next-sanity"

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

,

dataset

: 

"production"

,

apiVersion

: 

"2023-01-01"

,

useCdn

: 

true

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

 client.

fetch

(
    groq
`*[_type == "page"][0]{
      title,
      content
    }`

  )
}

💾 Save & Exit Nano

Press 
Ctrl + O
 to save.

Press 
Enter
 to confirm.

Press 
Ctrl + X
 to exit nano.

Once done, restart the dev server:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Let me know once it’s in — or if you hit any snags.

Beautiful! 🌟 That means your 
Sanity
 backend is now 
successfully integrated
 with your Next.js frontend — and you're able to 
query live CMS content
 from your Sanity Studio and render it on your site.
