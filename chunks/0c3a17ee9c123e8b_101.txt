Big win! 🎉

✅ What’s Working Now:

lib/sanity.ts
 is set up with the right project credentials.

Your 
getPage()
 function is fetching the correct data (like 
title
, 
content
) from the Sanity 
page
 schema.

The homepage (
app/page.tsx
) is now connected and hydrated with CMS data.

Dev server is running with no errors.

🚀 Next Steps You Might Consider:

Render the actual CMS content
 in the UI.

If you haven't yet, loop through the 
content
 blocks and render them dynamically with something like 

@portabletext/react

.

Make multiple sections CMS-editable

You can build out additional Sanity schemas like:

team.ts

hero.ts

cta.ts

Deploy this new version to Vercel

Since you're working off a 
main-site
 branch, you can set up a 
Preview Deployment
 in Vercel for testing and collaboration.

Enable live preview mode (optional)

If you want editors to see changes in real time as they edit content in Sanity, we can set that up with 
previewMode
.

Just let me know what you’d like to do next and I’ll walk you through it step by step. You're killing it. 💪

You said:

alright so should I be able to see the existing content in the editor? 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Yes — if everything is wired up correctly, you 
should absolutely be able to see
 the content you created in Sanity (like the 
"test page title"
 and the rich text blocks) 
displayed in the frontend
 under 
/
 (your homepage) 🎯

But to clarify your question:

🔍 In the 
Sanity Studio
 Editor:

✅ You should 
see the structured content
 like:

title: test page title

content: [array of rich text blocks]

If you go to 
http://localhost:3000/studio

, log in, and click into 
Documents → Page
, you’ll see that data.

🖥️ In the 
Next.js Frontend
:

✅ You should see the 
same content rendered
 dynamically if:

You’re correctly calling 
getPage()
 in 
app/page.tsx

You’re rendering the 
title
 and 
content
 from the fetched page

You're using 
@portabletext/react
 (or similar) to display rich text content properly

🔧 Let’s Confirm It's Working:

In your 
app/page.tsx
, after fetching the page, you should have something like:

tsx

Copy

const

 page = 

await

getPage

();

return

 (

<
main

>

<
h1

>{page.title}

</
h1

>

<
PortableText

value

=

{page.content}

 />

</
main

>
);

If you’re 
not using 
PortableText
 yet
, the rich content blocks won’t render — let me know and I’ll help set that up in one minute flat ⚡

Wanna go ahead and check if 
page.title
 is showing and we’ll go from there?

You said:

ok where am I going?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Great! Here's exactly where to go and what to check depending on what you're trying to confirm:

✅ 
1. To View/Edit Content in Sanity Studio

Go to:

👉 
http://localhost:3000/studio

(Or port 3001 if that’s the one running.)

Steps:

Log in with your Sanity account.

In the left menu, click 
Page
 under “Documents.”

You should see the "test page title" entry.

Click into it to see/edit the title and content blocks.

✅ 
2. To See the Content Rendered on Your Site (Frontend)

Go to:

👉 
http://localhost:3000

(Or again, 3001 depending on which one is active.)

This will show the frontend rendering
. You're checking:

Is the title (
test page title
) being shown?

Is any content from the Sanity editor being rendered?

🤖 
3. If You Don’t See Content Yet

Let’s check if your 
app/page.tsx
 has this basic integration:

Example code:

tsx

Copy

import

 { getPage } 

from

"@/lib/sanity"

import

 { 

PortableText

 } 

from

"@portabletext/react"

export

default

async

function

Home

(

) {

const

 page = 

await

getPage

()

return

 (

<
main

className

=

"container mx-auto py-10"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-4xl font-bold mb-4"

>{page.title}

</
h1

>

<
PortableText

value

=

{page.content}

 />

</
main

>
  )
}

If 
PortableText
 isn't installed yet:

bash

Copy

npm install @portabletext/react

Let me know which step you're on and what you’re seeing — I’ll guide you through the rest 🔥
