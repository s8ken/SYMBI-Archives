yes its still there but I am wondering where I see the main site that's rendering http://localhost:3000

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Ah, gotcha — you're asking:

Where do I find and edit the content that’s rendering on 
http://localhost:3000
 — the main site?

Here’s how to break that down:

🔍 The main site at 
http://localhost:3000
 is rendered from:

✅ 
app/page.tsx

This file is your homepage component, and it contains the JSX that builds out the full landing page — hero section, what/why/who sections, footer, etc.

🧠 You’ve connected Sanity CMS — so now the goal is:

Start replacing hardcoded content in 
app/page.tsx

 (like 
"Meet Symbi..."
, 
"What We Offer"
, etc.)

with dynamic content fetched from Sanity.

🧭 Where to look/edit now

Great question — here’s your path forward 🔥

✅ 
Where you're currently seeing content:

Rendered on
: 

http://localhost:3000

Controlled by
: 
app/page.tsx

Currently hardcoded
: All the sections (Hero, What, Why, Who, etc.) are still static content written directly in JSX.

✅ 
Where your CMS content lives:

In 
Sanity Studio
 at 

http://localhost:3000/studio

You’ve created documents like:

page
 → with 
title
 and 
content
 rich text

✅ 
Where to go next:

Now that you’ve wired up the Sanity client and 
getPage()
 fetch works:

🎯 You want to replace 
hardcoded content
 in 
app/page.tsx
 with 
Sanity-powered content
 from 
getPage()
.

🔧 Quick Checklist

Make sure your Sanity schema is set up
 to include all fields you’ll need — e.g., 
heroTitle
, 
heroDescription
, 
sections
, etc.

Update your GROQ query
 in 
lib/sanity.ts
 to fetch that data.

Replace static JSX content
 in 
app/page.tsx
 with dynamic variables from 
const page = await getPage()
.

Want me to help scaffold the GROQ query + dynamic JSX bindings?

I can refactor your 
getPage
 function and 
app/page.tsx
 to load Sanity content live. Just say the word 👇

I don't know what any of that mean :( wasn't this the low code cloud option

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

You're absolutely right — and no stress! 🙌 You 
did choose the low-code cloud option
, and you’ve already done the hard part: wiring up the Sanity CMS into your Next.js site. 💪

Let’s simplify what’s happening and what you need to do next:

🧠 Quick Concept: What You Have

Area
What it Does
Where it Is

Sanity Studio

Your visual editor (CMS)

http://localhost:3000/studio

Next.js Website

What people see on your site

http://localhost:3000

Sanity Data

Lives in the CMS and can be shown on site
Edited in Studio

Static Content

Hardcoded text and images
In 
app/page.tsx

✅ What You Want to Do

Replace hardcoded content (like “Meet Symbi, your intelligent AI assistant”) with content from 
Sanity CMS
, so you can change it visually in the editor instead of in code.

🪄 What’s Next (The Low-Code Part)

I’ll take care of the wiring for you. Here’s how it’ll work:

I’ll update your page code
 so it loads the data from Sanity.

You edit everything in the CMS
 — no more code changes just to update the text or headings.

✅ Let's Do It!

If you're ready, I’ll:

Update your 
lib/sanity.ts
 with the right query.

Refactor 
app/page.tsx
 to pull in content from Sanity.

Make sure it still matches the design you have now.

Just say:

"Yes, let’s wire it to Sanity!"

…and I’ll give you exactly the files to paste with full instructions. 🔌💫

ok I was just trying now to update the test page and I keep getting an error

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Got it — you're trying to update your test page in Sanity Studio, and it's throwing an error. Let’s fix this up.

To help you quickly, can you tell me:

✅ 
What exactly were you editing?
 (e.g., title, content block, etc.)

❌ 
What error message are you seeing?
 (copy-paste it or screenshot if easier)

💾 Did you hit "Publish" or just save the draft?

Also, if you added any custom fields or changed your schema (
schemas/page.ts
), let me kno
