just changing the title of the test page

Perfect — thanks! If you're only changing the title and you're getting an error when you try to save or publish, then the issue is very likely 
either a schema mismatch or a Studio sync issue.

Let’s go step-by-step to troubleshoot this:

✅ 1. Confirm the schema has 
title
 defined

In 
schemas/page.ts
, make sure the field for 
title
 is defined like this:

ts

Copy

import

 { defineType, defineField } 

from

'sanity'

export

default

defineType

({

name

: 

'page'

,

type

: 

'document'

,

title

: 

'Page'

,

fields

: [

defineField

({

name

: 

'title'

,

type

: 

'string'

,

title

: 

'Title'

,
    }),

defineField

({

name

: 

'content'

,

type

: 

'array'

,

title

: 

'Content'

,

of

: [{ 

type

: 

'block'

 }],
    }),
  ],
})

✅ 2. Restart your local server

After making sure the schema is correct:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Let it compile fully, and then try editing the title again in Studio (
http://localhost:3000/studio
).

✅ 3. Still getting an error?

If yes, 
copy the exact error message you’re seeing
, and I’ll jump in with the precise fix.

💡 
Bonus Tip
: If you've changed the schema but Studio hasn't picked it up, try clearing the 
.next
 cache:

bash

Copy

rm

 -rf .next
npm run dev

Let me know what the error says if it's still popping up!

not even saving it yet Error: Request error while attempting to reach is https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/actions/production?tag=sanity.studio.document.commit

Ah, that error message means your Sanity Studio 
cannot connect to the Sanity API
 — which typically happens when:

🚫 
CORS is not configured properly

Sanity blocks requests unless the origin (your localhost or domain) is explicitly allowed.

✅ 
Fix in 2 steps

1. Go to 

Sanity Manage

This is your project dashboard.

2. Add your local dev URL to the 
CORS Origins

In the 
API Settings
 section:

Click 
"Add CORS Origin"

Add:

arduino

Copy

http:

//localhost:3000

Check ✅ 
Allow credentials

Save

Once that’s added, 
restart your dev server
:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Now your Studio at 
http://localhost:3000/studio

 should be able to 
successfully connect to Sanity
, and saving should work again.

Let me know when that’s done — I can walk you through adding dynamic content next!
