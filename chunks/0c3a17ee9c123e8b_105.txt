Thanks for sharing that detailed error. The key issue is here:

Request error while attempting to reach https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/...

This indicates a 
network error
, meaning your Studio can't reach Sanity’s API.

✅ Most Likely Cause:

Your local development server (e.g., 
http://localhost:3000
) is 
not whitelisted in Sanity’s CORS settings
.

🔧 Fix: Add 
localhost
 to Sanity CORS origins

Go to the 
Sanity project settings

In the 
API
 tab, scroll to 
CORS Origins
 and click “
Add CORS Origin
”

Enter:

arduino

Copy

http:

//localhost:3000

✅ Check 
“Allow credentials”

Save
 the changes.

🔁 Then:

Restart your local dev server
:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Head to 
http://localhost:3000/studio

, try editing again.

Let me know if you hit any blockers after this. Once the connection is stable, we’ll make sure your site pulls in Sanity content as intended.

You said:

yeah its for the 3000 and the 3001

Perfect — you're spot on for whitelisting both ports.

✅ Here's what your Sanity CORS origins list should include:

arduino

Copy

http:

//localhost:3000

http:

//localhost:3001

And for each, make sure:

✅ “Allow credentials” is 
checked

💾 You 
save
 after adding each one

🔁 Once added:

Restart your local server:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Open your Sanity Studio at 

http://localhost:3000/studio

(or port 3001, depending on what’s in use)

Try editing and saving a document again.

If you’re still getting errors after that, we’ll dig into API keys or firewall blocks — but this fix usually clears it. Ready to test again?

Thanks for confirming — since both 
http://localhost:3000
 and 
http://localhost:3001
 are already whitelisted in your CORS settings and the issue still persists, let’s run through a rapid-fire 🔍 
diagnostic checklist
 to pinpoint the cause.

✅ Quick Sanity Save Debug Checklist:

1. 
Token Permissions (If Using an API Token)

Are you using an API token (like in a 
.env.local
 or headers)? If so:

Make sure the token has 
write permissions

Go to 
Sanity Manage

, click your project → 
API
 tab → scroll to "Tokens"

If you're not using a token for local studio, skip this.

2. 
Check if You're Online

Since this is a 
networkError
, confirm:

🛜 You're connected to the internet

🌐 You can access 
https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/...
 in your browser (try opening it — it should show a JSON message if working)

3. 
Sanity Project Dataset Permissions

Run this in terminal:

bash

Copy

npx sanity debug

Then check:

Is the 
dataset
 listed as 
production
?

Is it set to 
public
 or 
private
?

If it's private:

You 
must
 be logged into Sanity Studio

Or use an authenticated token

4. 
Sanity Studio Authentication

From the error, it looks like a request using an 
Authorization: Bearer
 header failed. Are you:

Editing the content 
as a logged-in user in Studio
?

If not logged in,
