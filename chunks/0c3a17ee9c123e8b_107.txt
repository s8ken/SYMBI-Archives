et’s now look one level 
up
 to the root of your project (you’re inside 
lib
 right now).

✅ Try this from the 
project root
:

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site
find . -name 

"sanity.config.ts"

This will search the whole project directory and tell us exactly where 
sanity.config.ts
 is (if it exists). Once we find it, we can verify and fix the 
projectId
.

Let me know what you get!

Perfect — we’ve found your 
sanity.config.ts
 file! ✅

Let’s now 
open and inspect that file
 to make sure your 
projectId
 and 
dataset
 are correctly defined.

🔍 Run this command to open the file:

bash

Copy

nano sanity.config.ts

Once inside, look for the 
projectId
 field. It should look something like:

ts

Copy

export

default

defineConfig

({

name

: 

'default'

,

title

: 

'Symbi Studio'

,

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,
  ...
})

Make sure:

projectId
 is 

wryptr7v

 (as per your Sanity debug output earlier)

dataset
 is 

production

 (or whatever dataset you actually created)

No extra characters like colons or quotes in the wrong places

When you're done:

Press 
Ctrl + O
 to save

Press 
Enter
 to confirm the filename

Press 
Ctrl + X
 to exit

Then run:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

And try saving content again from the Studio at 
http://localhost:3001/studio

Let me know how it goes — we’re super close! 🔥

import siteSettings from './schemas/siteSettings'
import { defineConfig } from 'sanity'
import { deskTool } from 'sanity/desk'
import { visionTool } from '@sanity/vision'
import page from './schemas/page'

export default defineConfig({
  name: 'default',
  title: 'Symbi Studio',
  projectId: 'wryptr7v',
  dataset: 'production',
  basePath: '/studio',
  plugins: [deskTool(), visionTool()],
  schema: {
    types: [siteSettings, page],
  },
})

That config looks perfect! ✅

You’ve got:

✅ Correct 
projectId: 'wryptr7v'

✅ Dataset: 
'production'

✅ Schema types correctly defined (
siteSettings
, 
page
)

✅ Essential Sanity tools added (
deskTool
, 
visionTool
)

🔄 Next Step: Restart your dev server

Just to clear any stale config and connections, run:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Once your app is running again:

Head to 
http://localhost:3001/studio

Try editing and saving a document (like your test page)

If the network error is still happening, we’ll double-check:

CORS settings
 for your project at 
https://www.sanity.io/manage

Make sure 
localhost:3000
 and 
localhost:3001
 are both added as allowed origins under 
API → CORS Origins

Let me know if the save works now or if we’re still hitting that error 👇

Got it — since the 
same network error
 is persisting when saving a document in Sanity Studio, even with correct config, we’re likely dealing with a 
CORS misconfiguration
 or 
invalid auth/token environment
. Let's troubleshoot this with precision:

✅ 1. 
Confirm CORS Origins

Go to 

sanity.io/manage

 → your 
symbi
 project → 
API > CORS Origins
.

Make sure 
these origins are added
:

arduino

Copy

http:

//localhost:3000

http:

//localhost:3001

Also tick:

 Allow credentials

 Allow all methods

Save changes.

✅ 2. 
Verify Token + Permissions

If you’re using a token in a 
.env.local
 or inside 
sanityClient
 config, ensure:

It's 
correctly scoped
 (read+write)

The token is 
NOT expired

The user who owns the token has 
editor
 or 
administrator
 role

You can regenerate a token at:

sanity.io/manage > API > Tokens

Example 
.env.local
:

env

Copy

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wryptr7v
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk...yourTokenHere...

Update your 
lib/sanity.ts
 (if using 
@sanity/client
) to include:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient } 

from

'
