🔥 That’s a 
win
! Everything compiled successfully and your 
.env.local
 file was detected — notice this line:

diff

Copy

- Environments: .env.local

That means your Sanity environment variables are now in place ✅

✅ Next Steps to Test It All

Now that the setup is live:

Head to 
http://localhost:3001/studio
 in your browser.

Try editing and saving that 
test page
 in Sanity Studio again.

Confirm that:

You can 
save
 the updated content (no API/network error).

It 
reflects
 on 
http://localhost:3001
 if your Next.js page is fetching from Sanity.

Let me know how the save goes. If it still errors out, we’ll recheck the token scope or CORS — but it looks like we’re right on track 🚀

I got got a 404

Thanks for the update — let’s get you into the Studio. A 404 on 
/studio
 usually means one of these:

🔍 Quick Debug Checklist

✅ 1. 
Check Sanity Studio Route

You must have this file in your Next.js app:

bash

Copy

app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx

If that folder/file isn’t there, create it like this:

bash

Copy

mkdir

 -p app/studio/[[...index]]

Then inside that folder, create 
page.tsx
 with:

tsx

Copy

'use client'

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

'next-sanity/studio'

import

 config 

from

'../../../sanity.config'

export

default

function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

=

{config}

 />
}

✅ 2. 
Double Check Your 
sanity.config.ts

Make sure it's at the root of your project (next to 
package.json
) and looks like this:

ts

Copy

import

 { defineConfig } 

from

'sanity'

import

 { deskTool } 

from

'sanity/desk'

import

 { visionTool } 

from

'@sanity/vision'

import

 siteSettings 

from

'./schemas/siteSettings'

import

 page 

from

'./schemas/page'

export

default

defineConfig

({

name

: 

'default'

,

title

: 

'Symbi Studio'

,

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

basePath

: 

'/studio'

,

plugins

: [

deskTool

(), 

visionTool

()],

schema

: {

types

: [siteSettings, page],
  },
})

✅ 3. 
Restart Dev Server

If you made any of those changes, restart Next.js:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Once that’s confirmed, navigate to:

bash

Copy

http://localhost:3001/studio

It should now load your embedded Sanity Studio.

Let me know what happens next, and I’ll walk with you through the rest.

acutally it came back up 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Perfect! 🙌 That means everything is connected correctly now — Next.js, Sanity Studio, schema, and embedded route at 
/studio
.

✅ Next Steps (Optional but Recommended)

If you're ready to integrate CMS content into the main site:

Verify GROQ Queries
 – You already tested fetching data from Sanity.

Use your 
lib/sanity.ts

 to create functions like 
getPage()
:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient } 

from

'next-sanity'

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

apiVersion

: 

'2025-02-19'

,

useCdn

: 

false

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

 client.

fetch
