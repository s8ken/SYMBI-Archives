}

Update 
app/page.tsx

 to consume that data:

tsx

Copy

import

 { getPage } 

from

'@/lib/sanity'

export

default

async

function

Home

(

) {

const

 page = 

await

getPage

()

return

 (

<
main

>

<
h1

>{page?.title}

</
h1

>
      {/* Render other content as needed */}

</
main

>
  )
}

If you want to wire in dynamic CMS content into the homepage layout (e.g. 
what
, 
why
, 
who
 sections), I can help you update the schema + frontend too. Just say the word 💬

Do you want to try that next?

Error: Request error while attempting to reach is https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/actions/production?tag=sanity.studio.document.commit

Thanks for flagging — that error usually means 
Sanity Studio is unable to commit/publish content
, and it’s most often caused by:

🚫 
Missing or invalid API token

Your Sanity Studio client needs an 
API token with write permissions
 to commit data. Since you mentioned earlier that there was 
nothing in your tokens list
, that’s likely the issue.

✅ Here’s how to fix it:

1. 
Create a new API token
 in 
Sanity Manage

Go to your project: 
wryptr7v

Click 
Settings → API → Tokens

Create a 
new token
 with 
Editor
 or 
Write
 permissions

Copy it immediately
 (it won’t be shown again)

2. 
Update your 
.env.local
 file

In your 
symbi-main-site/.env.local
 file, add:

bash

Copy

SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_newly_copied_token

✅ Make sure you 
don’t wrap it in quotes
 and 
no trailing spaces
.

3. 
Restart the dev server
 (important):

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Optional Debug

You can test if the token is working via a simple fetch using the 
@sanity/client
 instance and setting 
token: process.env.SANITY_API_TOKEN
.

Let me know when you’ve added the token and restarted. I’ll help you verify it’s working.

no we just made it like 5 minutes ago

Ah — perfect. If the token 
was just created
, but you're still seeing the 
Request error while attempting to reach
 message, here are the next steps to check:

✅ 
Checklist to Resolve the Error

1. 
.env.local contains the token?

Open 
.env.local
 at the root of your project and verify it includes:

env

Copy

SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk...   # The full token you just created

🔒 Make sure it's 
not wrapped in quotes

💡 Make sure there's 
no whitespace at the end

✅ Save the file

2. 
Your Sanity Client uses the token

In 
lib/sanity.ts
 (or wherever your client is defined), it 
must
 look like this:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

export

const

 sanityClient = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

apiVersion

: 

'2025-02-19'

, 

// or your version

useCdn

: 

false

,

token

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_TOKEN

, 

// 🔥 this must be here

})

3. 
Restart the Dev Server

This is critical so it picks up the token from 
.env.local
.

bash

Copy

npm run dev

4. 
Check for typos in projectId or dataset

In 
sanity.config.ts
, make sure the values are exact:

ts

Copy

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

🧪 Want to test it now?

Try going into 
http://localhost:3000/studio

 and editing + saving the test page.

If it 
still fails
, let me know:

What your 
.env.local
 file looks like (you can censor the token)

And the current contents of 
lib/sanity.ts

I’ll debug it instantly with you.

/sorry that file and I doing this time?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

No worries — let's walk through it 
step-by-step
 so you know exactly what file to check and what to do this time. Here's what you're doing and 
why it matters
:

🛠️ You’re Updating: 
.env.local

This file holds 
private environment variables
, including the 
Sanity API token
 that allows editing content in the Studio (at 
/studio
).

✅ Step-by-Step Fix

1. 
Open 
.env.local
 file

In your project root (
symbi-main-site
), create or open the file named:

lua
