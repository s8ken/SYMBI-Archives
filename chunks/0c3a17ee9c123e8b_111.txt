Perfect — you're super close! Here’s what’s going on and what to do next:

🔍 What Just Happened?

✅ 
touch .env.local
 — ✅ this 
created the file
 successfully.

❌ 
zsh: command not found: .env.local
 — That’s expected! 
.env.local
 is 
not a command or folder
, it’s a 
file
, so you don't run or 
cd
 into it.

✅ What You Need to Do Now

Let’s open and edit the file:

1. 
Open the file in your text editor (e.g., VS Code)

bash

Copy

code .env.local

If you're not using VS Code, you can also do:

bash

Copy

open -a TextEdit .env.local

2. 
Paste this into the file:

env

Copy

SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk4jQNIOJE1hrmV0LV98ULchrc6D8jUjqPYURxm9aMTVUU3x4twmOWlsQBbFdqFo92cvMmeDbEZUHzux

3. 
Save the file
 and close the editor.

4. 
Restart the development server:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Now try editing and saving in Sanity Studio again. Let me know what happens!

Perfect — that 
.env.local
 file looks great and contains all the correct Sanity credentials. If it was already there and you're still getting the error:

bash

Copy

Request error 

while

 attempting to reach https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/...

Then the issue is likely one of these:

✅ 
1. Token permissions

Ensure the token has 
write access
:

Go to 
Sanity Manage

Select your project (
symbi
)

Navigate to 
API > Tokens

Make sure the token:

Exists

Has 
"Editor"
 or 
"Developer"
 role (not just read-only)

Regenerate it if unsure, then update your 
.env.local
 file again

✅ 
2. Restart the dev server

After confirming the 
.env.local
 is correctly set:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

That ensures the env variables are reloaded.

✅ 
3. Double-check usage in code

Ensure the token is actually being passed into your client setup, typically in 
lib/sanity.ts
:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID

!,

dataset

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET

!,

apiVersion

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_VERSION

!,

token

: process.
