If all that checks out, try a quick 
test
: change something simple in Sanity Studio (like a title), hit save, and check if the error still appears.

Let me know if you'd like help testing or verifying any of this.

Nice! That log shows your main site is now running smoothly on 
http://localhost:3000

 ✅

Those 
GET /host 404
 logs are nothing to worry about — they’re likely requests from a browser extension or a leftover from Vercel/Next.js dev tools looking for a route that doesn’t exist. Since your root (
/
) is returning 
200
, you're good.

✅ So what’s working now:

Sanity Studio at 
/studio
 — ✅

Environment variables properly set — ✅

Main website is building and loading — ✅

🔜 Next steps:

If you're ready to start pulling CMS content (like that test page) into the actual site, I can walk you through integrating Sanity data into your homepage or dynamic routes.

Would you like to:

Render the "test page" from Sanity into 
/

?

Set up dynamic routing for individual pages (like 
/about
, 
/what
, etc.)
?

Deploy to Vercel as a preview/live environment?

Let me know what you’re aiming to do next, and I’ll guide you there step by step.

no I am done its just not working and we are going around and around

Totally understand — this has been a long and complex ride, and it's frustrating when things don’t just 
click into place
.

You've put in serious effort here, and that doesn't go unnoticed. Before we wrap, I want to give you a few clear options, no pressure:

🛠 If you want to take a break but come back later:

I can generate a 
clean checklist
 of what’s done vs. what’s still broken.

I can also prep a 
reset script or backup template
 based on what you've built.

🚀 If you’d prefer someone else to step in:

You can share your repo or environment with a dev or team member and I’ll help 
document the problem
 for them.

I can help prep a 
deployment handoff
 doc if needed.

🧘 Or, if you’re just done for now:

That’s more than okay. Close the terminal, take a walk, clear your head. You’ve already learned a ton. None of this work is wasted.

Let me know what you’d like — no code or debugging unless you ask. I’ve got your back whenever you’re ready.

You said:

it just doesn't appear robust enough 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

That’s a 
completely fair take
 — and honestly, you're not wrong.

Sanity + Next.js can be powerful, but when you’re expecting a low-code experience and instead run into:

fragile peer dependency conflicts,

confusing version mismatches,

and 500s on basic content updates...

…it 
stops feeling like a smooth developer experience
 and starts feeling like you’re wrestling with a brittle puzzle.

So, if you're questioning:

“Is this even the right tool for the job?”

That's valid.

If you're building a content-driven site with occasional interactivity — and want:

a smoother visual editor,

faster publishing with less plumbing,

or a setup that doesn’t break every time the ecosystem updates...

There 
are
 alternatives.

Want a couple of better-suited options for your use case?

I can recommend:

One simpler, drop-in CMS
 (e.g., 
Payload

, 
Plasmic

, or even 
Notion + Super

 for ultra-low-code),

One robust hosted alternative
 (e.g., 
Webflow CMS

 or 
Builder.io

),

One way to keep Sanity but simplify the setup
, using just GROQ and a static build.

Let me know your vibe — builder, dev, visual-first — and I’ll point you at what makes the most sense for 
you
. No fluff
