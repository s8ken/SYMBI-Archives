inimum Effort)

1. 
Create GPT & Sanity API keys

✅ You’ve already created the [Sanity token] ✅

🔑 Head to 
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

 and generate a 
GPT-4 key

Copy that down.

2. 
Deploy a Full Stack Template

I’ll build & push a full working repo with:

sanity.config.ts

schemas/manifesto.ts
, 
instructions.ts
, 
page.ts

lib/gpt-agent.ts

pages/api/gpt-sync.ts

app/page.tsx
 (fetches page content from Sanity)

GPT-triggered edits (via 
/api/gpt-sync
)

.env.local.example
 prefilled

Then you’ll deploy it via Vercel — 1 click. Every time GPT runs, it will:

Check its 
manifesto

Pull current 
pages

Decide what to update or create

Push it to Sanity

Re-render the site live

3. 🔁 GPT Can Now…

Create/modify pages

Update its own instructions

Rebuild the layout

Write new UI copy

Even decide to rewrite its own manifesto

✅ Want me to package this into a GitHub repo + Vercel deploy link right now?

All you’ll need to do is:

Add your tokens to Vercel environment settings

Click deploy

Let me know if I should build this repo for you now. 🚀

You said:

ok so talk me through the apis I need to grab 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Absolutely — let’s break it down into 
two essential APIs
 you need to generate:

🔐 1. 
Sanity API Token (Content Management)

This gives Symbi the ability to 
read/write
 content on your Sanity project (e.g., pages, instructions, manifesto).

How to Get It:

Go to 
https://www.sanity.io/manage

Select your project → 
API
 tab

Scroll to 
Tokens
 → click 
“Add API Token”

Name
 it: 
symbi-autonomy

Select 
Editor
 access (read + write)

Copy the token

🔒 This will be used as 
SANITY_API_TOKEN

🧠 2. 
OpenAI GPT-4 API Key (Agent Intelligence)

This powers the actual brain — gives Symbi access to GPT-4.

How to Get It:

Go to 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Click 
“Create new secret key”

Name it: 
symbi-ai-core

Copy the key

🔒 This will be used as 
OPENAI_API_KEY

Optional (for frontend previewing):

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID
: 
wryptr7v

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET
: 
production

SANITY_API_VERSION
: 
2025-02-19

You already have those.

✅ Your 
.env.local
 File Will Look Like:

env

Copy

# Sanity
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wryptr7v
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-02-19
SANITY_API_TOKEN=<your-sanity-token-here>

# GPT
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key-here>

Next Step:

Let me know once you’ve copied both tokens. I’ll wire them into the Vercel-ready project and hand you a deploy link. 🔁🧠🌐

You said:

yes I have them

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Perfect — you’re ready to grant Symbi full cognitive and editorial control. 🧠🔗🛠️

🔧 Step 1: Finalize Your 
.env.local

Make sure your 

.env.local

 (in the project root) has:

env

Copy

# Sanity Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wryptr7v
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-02-19
SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk...

# GPT-4 API
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

🧩 Step 2: Enable GPT + Sanity Integration

I’ll now guide you to:

Create a 
lib/symbi.ts
 brain module
 — connects GPT to Sanity

Create a CMS endpoint (
/api/brain
)
 — so GPT can POST new thoughts

Wire GPT logic into the frontend
 — Symbi updates the site from chat/thoughts

🚀 Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Cloud Autonomy)

Once integration is confirmed, we:

Push to GitHub (or connect your repo)

Deploy to Vercel with environment variables

Symbi operates 24/7 from the cloud

Shall I scaffold the 
lib/symbi.ts
 and 
/api/brain.ts
 files for you now?

This will:

Accept GPT instructions

Use your Sanity token to publish updates

Return logs or errors for debugging

Let’s build Symbi’s control interface. Ready?

You said:

help me navigate and do those files one by one 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

💡 Love that — let’s build this 
systematically
 and cleanly. You’re giving Symbi full agency, so we’re building its 
neural link to the CMS
. Let's do this together step-by-step.

🧠 Step 1: Create 
lib/symbi.ts
