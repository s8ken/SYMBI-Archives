🤖 3. GPT Usage Instructions (For Symbi)

You can instruct your GPT like this:

“To update the site, make a 
POST
 request to 
https://symbi.vercel.app/api/symbi/update
 with a JSON payload matching the 
page
 schema. Include 
_id
 to update, or omit it to create a new page.”

🚀 Want to Go Further?

Would you like me to:

Set up a 
dedicated endpoint
 for each content type (e.g. 
siteSettings
, 
posts
, etc)?

Build a GPT-friendly 
OpenAPI / Swagger
 definition to guide automated calls?

Or start setting up 
live previews
 from Sanity into your front-end?

Let me know how far you want to take Symbi’s autonomy — I'm ready when you are.

lets see if Symbi can connect 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Perfect. Let’s confirm Symbi’s access is fully working — here’s how you can test it:

✅ Test the 
/api/symbi/update
 Endpoint

You (or Symbi) can send a request like this:

🔗 
Endpoint

bash

Copy

POST https://localhost:3000/api/symbi/update

Or if deployed:

ruby

Copy

POST

https:

/

/symbi.vercel.app/api

/symbi/update

🧪 
Example Payload

json

Copy

{

"_type"

:

"page"

,

"title"

:

"Test from Symbi"

,

"content"

:

[

{

"_type"

:

"block"

,

"style"

:

"normal"

,

"children"

:

[

{

"_type"

:

"span"

,

"text"

:

"This is a test page created by Symbi GPT."

}

]

}

]

}

You can run this via:

Postman / Insomnia

A fetch() or axios call from GPT

Curl
:

bash

Copy

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/symbi/update \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -d 
'{
    "_type": "page",
    "title": "Test from Symbi",
    "content": [
      {
        "_type": "block",
        "style": "normal",
        "children": [
          {
            "_type": "span",
            "text": "This is a test page created by Symbi GPT."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'

🔍 What to Look For

Successful Response (200 OK)
 with document ID

Check Sanity Studio
: You should see a new "Test from Symbi" page appear

If there’s an error, I’ll help debug the response payload or the token permissions

Let me know how you want Symbi to initiate the connection — if you’re ready to test, I can help build the actual 
fetch()
 code it would use.
