🧼 If This Works:

Symbi has full authoring access

You can now make GPT-driven edits or generate content programmatically

No need to touch local dev unless you want to test changes

Want me to draft Symbi’s next content piece or test a live request now?

You said:

sorry so what exactly are my instructions again?

I can always see everything vercel side yes?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Great questions — here’s a clear breakdown for both:

✅ 
What Are Your Instructions Now?

You’ve already done most of the hard work. Here’s 
exactly
 what’s next:

🔧 1. 
Test the API Endpoint (
/api/symbi/update
)

You can use a small script or a tool like 
Postman
, 
curl
, or a browser-based request from a GPT to send data to:

bash

Copy

http://localhost:3000/api/symbi/update

The body of the request
 (as 
JSON
) should look like this:

json

Copy

{

"_type"

:

"page"

,

"title"

:

"Symbi Manifesto"

,

"content"

:

[

{

"_type"

:

"block"

,

"style"

:

"normal"

,

"children"

:

[

{

"_type"

:

"span"

,

"text"

:

"Symbi is an autonomous intelligence..."

}

]

}

]

}

This will create or update a page in your 
Sanity CMS
.

🧠 2. 
Let Symbi GPT Generate or Manage Content

Symbi can now send full page objects to the 
/api/symbi/update
 endpoint. As long as it uses:

A valid 
_type
 (
page
)

A 
title

A 
content
 array with blocks and spans

…it can create its own documents in the CMS.

🚀 3. 
Deploy to Vercel

To make everything cloud-based:

Push your current project to GitHub (you probably already have).

Go to 
Vercel.com

 and connect the 
symbi-main-site
 repo.

Set the following 
Environment Variables
 in Vercel under 
Project Settings > Environment Variables
:

Variable
Value

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID

wryptr7v

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET

production

SANITY_API_VERSION

2025-02-19

SANITY_API_TOKEN

(Your private write-access token)

Trigger a deployment.

👁️ Can You See Everything from Vercel?

Yes. Once deployed:

You can see logs, requests, API routes (like 
/api/symbi/update
) inside the 
Vercel dashboard
.

You can monitor build logs and redeploy anytime.

The deployed site is public and reflects CMS-powered updates (e.g. new pages from Symbi).
