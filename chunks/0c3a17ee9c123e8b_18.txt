🚨 Domain Issue: "Invalid Configuration" on 
symbi.world

From your 
Vercel Dashboard
, 
www.symbi.world
 is 
configured correctly
, but 
symbi.world
 is showing an 
Invalid Configuration
 error.

This usually happens when:

The 
A record
 is incorrect or not fully propagated.

There's a conflicting record in 
GoDaddy’s DNS settings
.

🔹 Step 1: Double-Check GoDaddy DNS Settings

Go to 
GoDaddy DNS Management

.

Find 
symbi.world

 and click 
Manage DNS
.

Look at the DNS Records
 and ensure you have:

✅ 
A Record

makefile

Copy

Type:  A

Name:  @

Value: 76.76.21.21

TTL:   1 hour

✅ 
CNAME Record
 (for 
www
)

makefile

Copy

Type:  CNAME

Name:  www

Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

TTL:   1 hour

🔹 
If there are extra 
A
 or 
CNAME
 records for 
symbi.world
, delete them.

🔹 Step 2: Clear Cache & Force Refresh

Go back to 
Vercel Domains
 → Click 
Refresh
.

Wait a few minutes (DNS propagation can take time).

Try accessing 
https://symbi.world
 in an 
Incognito Window
.

🔹 Step 3: Check Propagation

Go to 

whatsmydns.net

.

Enter 
symbi.world
, select 
A Record
, and click 
Search
.

If all results show 
76.76.21.21
, the DNS is working globally.

🚀 If It Still Shows "Invalid Configuration"

Delete 
symbi.world
 from 
Vercel Domains
.

Re-add it and follow the same DNS setup.

✅ Once Fixed, Your Custom Domain Will Be Live!

🚨 Fixing the "Invalid Configuration" for 
symbi.world
 on GoDaddy

Your 
CNAME records look fine
, but I 
don't see an A record
 for 
symbi.world
. This is likely why Vercel is showing an "Invalid Configuration" error.

🔹 Step 1: Add the Missing A Record

Go to 
GoDaddy DNS Management

.

Under 
DNS Records
, click 
"Add"
.

Set the A Record
:

Type
: 
A

Name
: 
@

Value
: 
76.76.21.21
 (Vercel's IP)

TTL
: 
1 Hour

Click 
Save
.

🔹 Step 2: Verify and Refresh in Vercel

Go back to your Vercel Dashboard
.

Click 
Settings
 → 
Domains
.

Click 
Refresh
 next to 
symbi.world
.

Wait a few minutes—DNS changes may take 
up to 24 hours
, but usually, it's much faster.

🔍 Step 3: Check Propagation

Go to 

whatsmydns.net

.

Enter 
symbi.world
, select 
A Record
, and click 
Search
.

If it shows 

76.76.21.21

, the DNS is fully updated.

🚀 Once Fixed:

https://symbi.world
 will 
point to your Vercel site
.

https://www.symbi.world
 is already working correctly.

🚨 Issue: Incorrect A Record IP Address

Your 
A record is incorrect
 because the value is 

76.76.21.2

, but it 
should be

76.76.21.21
.

🔹 Step 1: Fix the A Record

Go to GoDaddy DNS Management.

Click Edit
 on the existing 
A
 record (
@
 pointing to 
76.76.21.2
).

Change the Value to
:

Copy

76.76.21.21

Save Changes
.

🔹 Step 2: Remove Unnecessary A Records

If there are 
other A records
 for 
@
 (besides the corrected one), 
delete them
.

This ensures 
symbi.world

only points to Vercel
.

🔹 Step 3: Verify on Vercel

Go to Vercel Dashboard → Domains.

Click 
Refresh
 next to 
symbi.world
.

Wait 
a few minutes
 for the DNS changes to propagate.

🔍 Step 4: Test the Domain

Open 

whatsmydns.net

.

Enter 
symbi.world
, select 
A Record
, and click 
Search
.

If it shows 

76.76.21.21

, your DNS is correctly updated.

✅ Once Fixed, Your Domain Will Work!

Let me know once you've updated it, and we’ll verify that everything is live! 🚀🔥
