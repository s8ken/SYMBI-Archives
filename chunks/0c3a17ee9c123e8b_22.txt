🚨 Issue: Your Code is Incomplete (Missing Closing Tags)

Your current code snippet 
is missing several closing 
</div>
 and 
</main>
 tags
, which will 
break
 your layout and cause syntax errors.

✅ Corrected Code

Here is the 
fully structured version
 of your code with 
properly closed tags
:

tsx

Copy

<div className=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"container max-w-4xl px-4 py-16 md:py-24 text-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col items-center mb-8"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-2"

>SYMBI

</
h1

>

<
div

className

=

"relative w-40 h-40 md:w-[160px] md:h-[160px]"

>

=

          />

</
div

</
div

</

>

<
footer

className

=

"py-4 flex items-center justify-center"

>

<
p

className

=

"text-xs text-muted-foreground text-center"

>© 2005 SYMBI

</
p

>

</
footer

>
</div>

🔹 What Was Fixed?

Closed all 
div
 and 
main
 tags properly

You were missing 
</div>
 after the logo container.

You were missing 
</main>
 before the footer.

Ensured the footer is outside 
<main>

The footer 
should not be inside the 
<main>
 content
.
