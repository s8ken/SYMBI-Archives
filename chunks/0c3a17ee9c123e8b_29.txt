Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

That makes total sense! If you're looking for a 
dashboard with a simple GUI to edit pages
 and an 
AI assistant for content updates
, here’s what I’d recommend:

🔹 Best Solution: Next.js + Strapi (or Sanity) + AI Integration

This setup will give you:

✅ 
A user-friendly CMS (dashboard) to edit pages

✅ 
No coding needed for updates
 (text, images, layout)

✅ 
AI-powered content generation
 (e.g., automated copywriting, image generation)

✅ 
Smooth integration with Vercel

🛠️ Recommended Tech Stack

1️⃣ 
🔧 Content Management System (CMS)

Strapi
 (best for self-hosted) OR

Sanity.io
 (best for cloud-based & real-time editing)

WordPress (headless)
 (if you're used to WP)

2️⃣ 
🌍 Next.js Frontend

Your existing Next.js site
 will fetch content dynamically from the CMS.

All changes will reflect instantly.

3️⃣ 
🤖 AI Integration (Optional)

ChatGPT API
: AI-generated content suggestions for headlines, blog posts, etc.

Replicate API
: AI-generated images & designs.

🔹 Option 1: Strapi CMS (Self-Hosted)

Strapi is 
open-source
, free, and lets you 
edit pages via a clean dashboard
.

How It Works

✅ 
Strapi
 lets you define 
page content (e.g., homepage, about, blog)

✅ A 
dashboard
 lets you edit text/images with a simple UI.

✅ Next.js 
fetches data dynamically
, so updates appear instantly.

✅ AI-powered text/image generation can be integrated.

const

 res = 

await

fetch

(

'http://localhost:1337/api/pages?populate=*'

);

const

 data = 

await

 res.

json

();

Use this data to dynamically render content.
