🚀 Sanity Setup in Next.js 15 + React 19

You're getting a 
compatibility warning
 because 
Sanity isn’t fully compatible with React 19
 yet. But don’t worry—we can fix this! 🔧

🔹 Step 1: Continue Installation

1️⃣ 
Choose Yes (

) for TypeScript

2️⃣ Let the setup complete.

🔹 Step 2: Apply Fix for React 19 Compatibility

After installation:

Open 

sanity.config.ts

 and modify the 
useCdn
 setting:

ts

Copy

import

 { defineConfig } 

from

"sanity"

;

export

default

defineConfig

({

projectId

: 

"your-project-id"

,

dataset

: 

"production"

,

useCdn

: 

false

, 

// Ensure fresh content in dev mode

reactStrictMode

: 

false

, 

// Fix for React 19 compatibility

});

Also, in 

package.json

, add this under 
dependencies
:

json

Copy

"sanity"

:

"^3.0.0"

,

"next-sanity"

:

"^4.0.0"

,

Run:

bash

Copy

npm install

🔹 Step 3: Restart the Dev Server

npm run dev

✅ Now, 
Sanity Studio should load correctly

🚀 What is Sanity Studio and Why Do You Need It?

Sanity Studio is a 
dashboard (CMS)
 that lets you 
edit and manage your website content easily
, without touching code. Since you want a 
GUI-based editor for your Next.js website
, 
Sanity Studio is what provides that
.

🔹 Why Use Sanity Studio?

✅ 
Easy Page Editing:
 No coding required—just update text, images, or layouts in a user-friendly UI.

✅ 
Real-Time Updates:
 Any edits made in the Studio 
immediately update your website
 (no need to redeploy).

✅ 
AI-Powered Content:
 We can integrate your GPT model 
directly into the Studio
 to generate content.

✅ 
Cloud-Based:
 Changes sync instantly across all users & devices.

🔹 How Does It Work?

1️⃣ 
Sanity Studio (CMS) → Stores Page Content

Example: "Homepage Title = SYMBI", "Text = Coming Soon"

2️⃣ 
Next.js Fetches This Content

The website dynamically loads the latest data.

3️⃣ 
AI Assistant Generates Content (Optional)

If enabled, AI can suggest 
headlines, blog posts, or text
 inside the Studio.

🔹 Step 1: Open Sanity Studio

After running:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Visit:

📌 

http://localhost:3333

(You’ll see the Sanity Studio dashboard where you can edit your content.)

🔹 Step 2: What Can You Edit in the Studio?

Homepage Title

Animated Words List

Text, Images, Videos

Future Pages (Blog, About, etc.)

🎯 Next Steps

Open Sanity Studio (
http://localhost:3333
).

Let me know if you see the dashboard!

We’ll now connect it to your Next.js site for real-time updates.
