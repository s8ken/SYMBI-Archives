🔹 Step 2: If That Fails, Use 
--force

If the above command 
still fails
, try:

bash

Copy

npm install --force

⚠️ 
Warning:
 This 
may break dependencies
, so we will test the build afterward.

🔹 Step 3: Ensure Sanity Studio Uses the Correct React Version

After installation, 
check which React version is installed
:

bash

Copy

npm list react

If it 
still shows React 19
, downgrade it:

bash

Copy

npm install react@18 react-dom@18

✅ This ensures 
Sanity works properly
 while still keeping Next.js functional.

🔹 Step 4: Restart Everything

Now, 
rebuild and test
:

bash

Copy

rm

 -rf .next
npm run dev

🚀 Fixing Sanity Installation After Removal

Since you removed 
Sanity, 
node_modules
, and 
.next

, let's 
properly reinstall everything
 while fixing the 
React 19 compatibility issues
.

🔹 Step 1: Install Dependencies with Compatibility Fixes

Since 
Sanity doesn't fully support React 19
, we need to 
force install it
:

1️⃣ Install All Packages

Run:

bash

Copy

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

✅ This ensures all dependencies install 
without strict version conflicts
.

🔹 Step 2: Reinstall Sanity Studio

Since 
Sanity was removed
, let's reinstall it:

bash

Copy

npm install sanity @sanity/client @sanity/vision @sanity/icons @sanity/image-url next-sanity

🔹 Step 3: Ensure React 18 is Installed

Sanity 
doesn't fully support React 19 yet
, so 
downgrade React to 18
:

bash

Copy

npm install react@18 react-dom@18

🔹 Step 4: Rebuild the Project

bash

Copy

rm

 -rf .next
npm run dev

📌 
Check if your website works:

http://localhost:3000

📌 
Check if Sanity Studio loads:

http://localhost:3000/studio

🎯 Let Me Know If This Works! 🚀🔥

If 
Sanity Studio still doesn’t load
, send me the 
full error log from your terminal
 so I can debug further! 😊

5 moderate security vulnerabilities

🔹 Step 1: Fix Security Issues (Optional)

Run:

bash

Copy

npm audit fix

If some issues remain, try:

bash

Copy

npm audit fix --force

⚠️ 
Note:
 Using 
--force
 may update packages to breaking versions, so be sure to test afterward.

🔹 Step 2: Start Your Project

Now, 
run your development server
:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ 
Check your website at:

http://localhost:3000

✅ 
Check Sanity Studio at:

http://localhost:3000/studio

🔹 Step 3: Verify What's Working

1️⃣ 
Does your website load correctly?

2️⃣ 
Does Sanity Studio (
/studio
) open without errors?

3️⃣ 
Any missing styles, broken layouts, or console errors?

🎯 If Anything Fails, Send the Error Message! 🚀🔥

If something is broken, send the 
full error log from your terminal
 so I can debug further! 😊
