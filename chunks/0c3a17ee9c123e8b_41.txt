🚨 Major Issue: Sanity Installation is Completely Broken

Your 
Sanity setup is completely broken
 due to:

Missing exports in 
sanity.config.ts

 (e.g., 
defineConfig
 not found).

Incorrect 
structureTool
 import
 (this was removed in newer Sanity versions).

next-sanity/studio
 is not exporting 
metadata
 or 
viewport
 anymore
.

React 19 + Next.js 15 is causing issues with Sanity plugins
.

🔥 Solution: Full Reset & Proper Sanity Setup

Let's 
completely reset Sanity
 and 
install it correctly for Next.js 15
.

🔹 Step 1: Remove Everything Sanity-Related

Run:

bash

Copy

rm

 -rf sanity node_modules .next package-lock.json

This 
removes all broken Sanity files
 and 
clears cached builds
.

🔹 Step 2: Reinstall Sanity Studio

Now, 
install Sanity with proper dependencies
:

bash

Copy

npm install sanity @sanity/client next-sanity @sanity/icons @sanity/image-url

✅ 
Fixes missing dependencies.

🔹 Step 3: Fix 
sanity.config.ts

After reinstalling, 
open 
sanity.config.ts

:

bash

Copy

nano sanity.config.ts

Replace 
everything
 with this 
corrected version
:

ts

Copy

import

 { defineConfig } 

from

"sanity"

;

import

 { deskTool } 

from

"sanity/desk"

;

import

 { visionTool } 

from

"@sanity/vision"

;

import

 page 

from

"./schemas/page"

;

export

default

defineConfig

({

basePath

: 

"/studio"

,

projectId

: 

"your-project-id"

,

dataset

: 

"production"

,

title

: 

"Symbi Studio"

,

plugins

: [

deskTool

(), 

visionTool

()],

schema

: {

types

: [page],
  },

reactStrictMode

: 

false

, 

// Fixes React 19 issues

});

✅ 
Fixes missing exports (
defineConfig
) and removes 
structureTool

.

🔹 Step 4: Fix Next.js Route for Sanity Studio

Now, 
open your Next.js Studio page file
:

bash

Copy

nano app/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx

Replace 
everything
 with this:

tsx

Copy

"use client"

;

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

"next-sanity/studio"

;

import

 config 

from

"../../../sanity.config"

;

export

default

function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

=

{config}

 />;
}

✅ 
Fixes metadata & viewport export errors.

🔹 Step 5: Rebuild Everything

bash

Copy

npm install
npm run dev

✅ 
Your site should now load at:

http://localhost:3000

✅ 
Sanity Studio should open at:

http://lo
