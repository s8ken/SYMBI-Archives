-animate

or, if you're using Yarn:

bash

Copy

yarn add tailwindcss-animate

2️⃣ Restart Your Next.js Dev Server

After installing the missing dependency, restart your server:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

or

bash

Copy

yarn dev

Then, check 

http://localhost:3000

 to see if everything is working properly.

3️⃣ Verify the Tailwind Configuration

Your current 
tailwind.config.ts
 file is 
almost perfect
, but ensure:

The 
content
 paths cover all components and pages correctly.

The plugin (
tailwindcss-animate
) is now properly recognized.

    },
  },

: [

require

(

)], 

// Ensure this works after installation

};

export

default

 config;

🚀 Final Check

If everything compiles without errors:

Try making a small CSS change in 
globals.css
 to confirm Tailwind is working
 (e.g., change the background color).

If you still have issues, 
send me any new error logs
 after restarting the server.

Let me know if anything else breaks!

You said:

it looks as intended locally - if I wanted to add a text animation (so eg letters typing) how would I do that?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Great! Since your project is working as expected locally, let's 
add a text animation effect
 to create a 
typing effect
 for your text.

📌 Adding a Typing Animation Effect

1️⃣ Install 
react-typical
 (Best for Simplicity)

To create a typing effect without manually coding animations, install 

react-typical

:

bash

Copy

npm install react-typical

or

bash

Copy

yarn add react-typical

2️⃣ Use It in Your 
page.tsx

Modify your 

app/page.tsx

 to include the animation:

tsx

Copy

"use client"

;

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

import

Typical

from

"react-typical"

;

export

default

function

  );
}

🎨 How It Works

The 
Typical
 component 
types and deletes words dynamically
.

The 
steps
 array defines the 
text
 and how long it appears (
in milliseconds
).

"SYMBI", 1000,
 → Displays 
SYMBI
 for 1 second.

"Welcome to SYMBI", 1500,
 → Changes to 
Welcome to SYMBI
 for 1.5 seconds.

"Coming Soon", 2000,
 → Types 
Coming Soon
 and holds for 2 seconds.
