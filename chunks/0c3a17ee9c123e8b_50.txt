static pages (like your homepage).

🧠 Step 3: Add Sanity Studio Route to Next.js

Create this file:

bash

Copy

mkdir

 -p app/studio/[[...index]]
nano app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx

Paste this:

tsx

Copy

'use client'

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

'next-sanity/studio'

import

 config 

from

'../../../sanity.config'

export

default

function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

=

{config}

 />
}

🧪 Step 4: Run It All

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Then open:

🧠 CMS Studio: 

http://localhost:3000/studio

🖥️ Website: 

http://localhost:3000

✅ Next Up: Connect CMS Data to Your Homepage

When you're ready, I’ll show you how to:

Pull CMS data dynamically into 
app/page.tsx

Replace hardcoded content with editable fields

Use live previews and eventually plug in AI ✨

🚀 Fixing the 
zsh: no matches found
 Error

You're getting 
"no matches found"
 because 
zsh
 is 
interpreting 
[[...index]]
 as special characters
 instead of a directory name.

✅ Solution: Use Quotes When Creating the Directory

Run:

bash

Copy

mkdir

 -p 

"app/studio/[[...index]]"

Now, create the file:

bash

Copy

nano 

"app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx"

✅ 
This will allow you to create the route without 
zsh
 errors.

📌 Reminder: Paste This Inside 
page.tsx

After opening the file in Nano, paste this:

tsx

Copy

'use client'

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

'next-sanity/studio'

import

 config 

from

'../../../sanity.config'

export

default

function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

=

{config}

 />
}

Then 
save and exit:

Ctrl + X

Y

Enter

🚀 Next Steps

Now, start your project:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ 
Open Sanity Studio:

http://localhost:3000/studio

✅ 
Check the website:

http://localhost:3000
