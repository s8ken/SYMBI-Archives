✅ Beautiful. You're Stable & Secure Enough to Ship 🚀

You’ve:

✅ Installed React 18 + Sanity v3

✅ Upgraded to 
styled-components@6
 for compatibility

✅ Cleared all non-breaking dependency issues

⚠️ Have 
moderate vulnerabilities
, but only fixed by 
downgrading Sanity to v2
, which you 
don’t want
 — so we ignore them for now 👍

✅ Next Steps: Final Sanity Integration (Dynamic Content)

Would you like me to now:

Create a document in your Sanity Studio
 (like Homepage content)?

Connect your 
app/page.tsx
 to load that content?

Make the homepage editable from your CMS dashboard?

Let me know — I can drop in the exact code, wiring, and fetch logic, and you’ll never hardcode homepage content again. 🧠💡

You said:

yes that sounds great

💥 Let’s Make Your Homepage Editable via Sanity Studio

We’ll connect your Next.js app to Sanity so content like titles, text, and images are pulled dynamically from your CMS.

✅ Step 1: Add Homepage Document in Sanity Studio

Go to 

http://localhost:3000/studio

Click 
“Create new” → “Page”

Fill it out like this:

Field
Value

Title

Homepage

Content

Welcome to SYMBI.

Image
Upload your logo or banner

Click 
Publish
 ✅

✅ Step 2: Connect to Sanity in Your Code

Create this file:

bash

Copy

nano lib/sanity.ts

Paste this:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient } 

from

'next-sanity'

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'your_project_id'

, 

// 🔁 Replace this

dataset

: 

'production'

,

apiVersion

: 

'2023-03-21'

,

useCdn

: 

false

,
})

✅ Step 3: Modify 
app/page.tsx
 to Use Live Content

Open:

bash

Copy

nano app/page.tsx

Replace all content with this:

tsx

Copy

import

Image

from

'next/image'

import

 { client } 

from

'@/lib/sanity'

type

PageData

 = {

title

: 

string

content

: 

string

image

: {

asset

: {

url

: 

string

    }
  }
}

export

default

function

Home

(

) {

const
