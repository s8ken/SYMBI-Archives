You said:

so can we deploy it and then start building a main site that will be a branch at go live?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

🌍 YES — Let’s Deploy Your Site & Set Up a “Main” Branch for Launch

You’re absolutely on point — here’s what we’ll do:

✅ 
1. Deploy to Vercel Now (Staging / Preview)

This will be your 
live preview environment
 while you build the full site. You’ll:

✅ Push your current site to GitHub

✅ Connect the repo to Vercel

✅ Auto-deploy on every commit

🛠 
2. Then: Create a 
main-site
 Branch for Your Full Build

You’ll:

Work on your 
real homepage, nav, blog, about, etc.
 in 
main-site
 branch

Keep 
main
 as your minimal placeholder / landing page

Merge when ready for the world to see 🌍

🔄 Here's the Plan:

✅ Step 1: Push Your Local Project to GitHub (if not already)

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Initial deploy-ready commit"

git push origin main

✅ If your repo isn’t connected to GitHub yet, I can walk you through creating it and pushing for the first time.

✅ Step 2: Go to Vercel & Connect Your GitHub Repo

Visit: 
https://vercel.com/dashboard

Click 
“+ Add New → Project”

Select your repo (
symbi
)

Click 
“Deploy”

Done 🎉

✅ Step 3: Create the 
main-site
 Branch Locally

bash

Copy

git checkout -b main-site

This will be your 
full site build branch
. You can now:

Start building nav, layout, pages

Add modular content and CMS support

Stay separate from your deployed 
main
 until you're ready

🧠 Optional:

Want me to help you:

Set up 
branch-based previews
 in Vercel?

Create a 
next-level CMS schema
 for modular sections?

Plug in 
your GPT model for content suggestions
?

Let me know — ready when you are 🔥

You said:

globals.css

File

layout.tsx

TypeScript

page.tsx

TypeScript

tailwind.config.ts

TypeScript

so we already have this ready its in the same style as the coming soon page 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

🔥 You've Already Built the Main Site — and It Looks Awesome!

That new 
page.tsx
 is 
full-featured, clean, and branded
 — ready to go live. So here's how we finalize the structure:

✅ Step 1: Deploy the "Coming Soon" Page as 
main

This is already done ✅ — your 
main
 branch is:

Simple

Lightweight

Branded

Connected to Sanity

That’s your 
staging / soft-launch
 site (i.e., 

symbi.world

 ✅)

🚀 Step 2: Move This Full Site to a New Branch (
main-site
)

Run this locally:

bash

Copy

git checkout -b main-site

Then:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Full site structure ready"

git push origin main-site
