✅ Your GitHub will now have:

main
 → Current live site (Coming soon)

main-site
 → Full experience, building in parallel

🌐 Step 3: Set Up Vercel Preview for 
main-site

Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

Open your 
Symbi
 project

Go to 
Settings → Git

Ensure 
"Automatically deploy new branches"
 is 
enabled

Vercel will create a preview like:

arduino

Copy

https:

//main-site-symbi.vercel.app

You can use this to:

Preview your full site

Share it with collaborators

QA everything before launch

🧠 Optional: Schedule a Switch

When you're ready to go live:

bash

Copy

git checkout main
git merge main-site
git push origin main

✅ Boom — your 
full site is now public
 on 
symbi.world

✨ Ready for Next Steps?

I can now:

🎨 Help style dynamic blocks via Sanity (make the full site editable)

🔗 Wire up nav, content, pricing, etc. from Studio

🤖 Add GPT-4-based editing assistant into your CMS

Let me know what you want next. You're in launch shape, my friend 💪🔥

You said:

so do I put those files I shared somewhere specific?

Where to Place the Files You Uploaded

Your files are 
ready to be integrated
 into your 
main-site
 branch. Here's where they should go in your project:

📌 
1. Move 
globals.css
 (Styles)

This should go in:

bash

Copy

./styles/globals.css

Run:

bash

Copy

mv

 /mnt/data/globals.css styles/globals.css

✅ 
Ensures your Tailwind and global styles apply correctly.

📌 
2. Move 
layout.tsx
 (Page Layout)

This file should be inside:

bash

Copy

./app/layout.tsx

Run:

bash

Copy

mv

 /mnt/data/layout.tsx app/layout.tsx

✅ 
This controls the global structure of the site (header, footer, etc.).

📌 
3. Move 
page.tsx
 (Homepage)

Place this in:

bash

Copy

./app/page.tsx

Run:

bash

Copy

mv

 /mnt/data/page.tsx app/page.tsx

✅ 
This is the main landing page.

📌 
4. Move 
tailwind.config.ts
 (Tailwind Setup)

Since Tailwind config files live at the project root, move it here:

bash

Copy

./tailwind.config.ts

Run:

bash

Copy

mv

 /mnt/data/tailwind.config.ts tailwind.config.ts

✅ 
Ensures Tailwind works correctly with the new UI.

🚀 
Final Steps to Apply the Changes

After placing the files correctly:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Integrated main-site design"

git push origin main-site

Then check the preview at:

arduino

Copy

https:

//main-site-symbi.vercel.app

🔥 
Next Steps (Optional)

Would you like me to:

Make it CMS-driven?
 (Editable in Sanity Studio)

Ensure full responsiveness & animations?

Set up AI content editing inside Sanity?

Let me know, and I’ll drop in the next level of code! 🚀🔥

You said:

alright so I just created a new project folder in documents called symbi-main-site

🚀 
Great! Setting Up 
symbi-main-site
 as Your Full Project

Now that you’ve created a 
separate project folder
, we’ll set it up 
correctly as a branch-based workflow
.

✅ 
Step 1: Clone the Repo Into Your New Folder

Since 
symbi-main-site
 is a full build, we need to 
clone your GitHub repo inside it
.

Run:

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site
git 

clone

 https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/symbi.git .
git checkout -b main-site

✅ This does:

Clones your existing 
symbi
 repo

Switches to a 
new 
main-site
 branch
 for your 
full build

✅ 
Step 2: Move Your Files into This New Project

Now 
move the files you uploaded
 into 
symbi-main-site
:

bash

Copy

mv

 /mnt/data/globals.css styles/globals.css

mv

 /mnt/data/layout.tsx app/layout.tsx

mv

 /mnt/data/page.tsx app/page.tsx

mv

 /mnt/data/tailwind.config.ts tailwind.config.ts

✅ 
Now your design & structure are in the correct place.

✅ 
Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run:

bash

Copy

npm install

✅ This ensures 
Tailwind, Sanity, Next.js, and all other dependencies
 are installed.

✅ 
Step 4: Start Your Dev Server

Run:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Then check:

🖥️ 
Main Site Preview
 → 

http://localhost:3000

🧠 
Sanity Studio (if enabled)
 → 

http://localhost:30
