✅ Perfect — that’s exactly the kind of quick tweak that’s super smooth now that you’re running with a clean setup and version control.

💡 Quick Tips After Updating Your Logo File:

✅ If You Just Replaced It Locally:

Make sure it’s staged and committed:

bash

Copy

git add public/symbi-logo.jpg
git commit -m 

"Updated logo"

git push origin main-site

🧠 
Assumes your logo is stored in 
public/
 and referenced like 
/symbi-logo.jpg
 in your code.

✅ Vercel Will Auto-Deploy

Vercel will redeploy your 
main-site

Make it CMS-editable in Sanity?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

🔥 Let’s Make Your Logo CMS-Editable via Sanity Studio

This means: you (or anyone non-technical) can change the logo image right inside your Studio — no code edits, no Git commits.

✅ Step 1: Add a 
siteSettings
 Schema

Create the file:

bash

Copy

nano schemas/siteSettings.ts

Paste this schema:

ts

Copy

import

 { defineType, defineField } 

from

'sanity'

export

default

defineType

({

name

: 

'siteSettings'

,

title

: 

'Site Settings'

,

type

: 

'document'

,

fields

: [

defineField

({

name

: 

'logo'

,

title

: 

'Logo Image'

,

type

: 

'image'

,
    }),

defineField

({

name

: 

'tagline'

,

title

: 

'Tagline'

,

type

: 

'string'

,
    }),
  ],
})

✅ Step 2: Register It in 
sanity.config.ts

Open:

bash

Copy

nano sanity.config.ts

Update the 
schema.types
 array to include both 
page
 and 
siteSettings
:

ts

Copy

import

 page 

from

'./schemas/page'

import

 siteSettings 

from

'./schemas/siteSettings'

schema

: {

types

: [page, siteSettings],
},

✅ Step 3: Create Your Logo in Studio

Go to 

http://localhost:3000/studio

Click ➕ "New" → Choose 
Site Settings

Upload your logo

(Optional) Add a tagline

Click 
Publish
 ✅

✅ Step 4: Update 
layout.tsx
 to Use CMS Logo

Open:

bash

Copy

nano app/layout.tsx

Add this to the top:

tsx

Copy

import

 { client } 

from

'@/lib/sanity'

async

function

getLogoUrl

(

) {

const

 data = 

await

 client.

fetch

(
`*[_type == "siteSettings"][0]{
    logo{asset->{url}}
  }`
)

return

 data?.

logo

?.

asset

?.

url

}

Then inside your 
RootLayout
, modify where your logo is rendered:

tsx

Copy

const

 logoU
