🚨 
Fix: 
metadata
 Cannot Be Used in a 
"use client"
 Component

Next.js 
does not allow exporting 
metadata
 inside a client component
 (
"use client";
). Since we added 
"use client";
 in 
layout.tsx
, the 
metadata must be moved
.

✅ 
Solution: Move 
metadata
 to a Separate File

1️⃣ 
Create a new metadata file

bash

Copy

nano app/metadata.ts

Paste this:

ts

Copy

export

const

 metadata = {

title

: 

"Symbi AI - Intelligent Assistant"

,

description

: 

"Empowering your workflow with advanced artificial intelligence that adapts to your needs."

,

generator

: 

"v0.dev"

,
};

2️⃣ 
Remove 
metadata
 from 
layout.tsx

Open:

bash

Copy

nano app/layout.tsx

Then 
delete this part
:

ts

Copy

export

const

 metadata = {
