🎨 How It Works

The 

phrases
 array
 contains the text and duration (in seconds) for each phrase.

useState
 and 
useEffect

 cycle through the words 
infinitely
.

Framer Motion (
motion.h1
)
 applies:

initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
 → Starts 
invisible
.

animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
 → Fades 
in
.

exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
 → Fades 
out
.

transition={{ duration: 0.8, ease: "easeInOut" }}
 → Smooth fading.

🚀 Final Steps

Test locally
 (
npm run dev
).

Push changes to GitHub
:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added animated text effect"

git push origin main

Vercel will automatically redeploy! 🎉

💡 
Want additional effects?
 I can tweak the fade speed, colors, or add extra animations. Just let me know! 😊🚀
