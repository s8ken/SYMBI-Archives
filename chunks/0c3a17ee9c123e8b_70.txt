✅ 
Now 
layout.tsx
 should only contain UI-related code.

3️⃣ 
Restart the Server

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Then check:

🖥️ 
Homepage:

http://localhost:3001

🧠 
Sanity Studio (if enabled):

http://localhost:3001/studio

🔥 
Why This Works

metadata
 must be in a server component
 (it’s static and Next.js injects it at the page level).

Moving it to 
metadata.ts

 ensures it remains in a 
server-only file
, separate from 
layout.tsx
.

Let me know if this worked, and we’ll move forward 🚀🔥

You said:

"use client";
import type React from "react"
import { Inter } from "next/font/google"
import "./globals.css"
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] })

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="light" enableSystem disableTransitionOnChange>
          {children}
        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>  
  )
}  

import './globals.css'

✅ 
Your 
layout.tsx
 is now correctly structured as a client component
 without the 
metadata
 export issue.

🚀 Next Steps

Now that the 
layout.tsx
 issue is resolved, you should:

1️⃣ Restart Your Next.js Server

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Check:

Homepage:

http://localhost:3001

Sanity Studio:

http://localhost:3001/studio

2️⃣ (Optional) Add 
metadata
 Back in a Server File

Since 
metadata
 was removed from 
layout.tsx
, you may still want a 

metadata.ts

 file for SEO:

📌 
Create 
app/metadata.ts

bash

Copy

nano app/metadata.ts

Paste this:

ts

Copy

export

const

 metadata = {

title

: 

"Symbi AI - Intelligent Assistant"

,

description

: 

"Empowering your workflow with advanced artificial intelligence that adapts to your needs."

,

generator

: 

"v0.dev"

,
};

✅ Now 
metadata is handled separately in a server component
, following Next.js best practices.

3️⃣ Test Everything

Once your server is running, confirm:

✅ 
No hydration errors

✅ 
Sanity Studio loads correctly

✅ 
Homepage works without crashes

Let me know if you hit any new errors or if it’s running smoothly! 🚀🔥

You said:

okay so its rendering correctly but there's still Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used

- A server/client branch 
if (typeof window !== 'undefined')
.
- Variable input such as 
Date.now()
 or 
Math.random()
 which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error

- className="light"
- style={{color-scheme:"light"}}

Fixing the Hydration Error in Next.js

Since your site is rendering 
but still showing a hydration error
, the issue is likely caused by:

Mismatched server vs. client HTML

ThemeProvider (
next-themes
)

A dynamic variable (
Date.now()
, 
Math.random()
, etc.) rendering differently between SSR & client

✅ 
Step 1: Fix ThemeProvider with 
useEffect

If you're using 

next-themes

, wrap it with a 
useEffect
 inside 
layout.tsx
:

📍 Open 
app/layout.tsx
:

bash

Copy

nano app/layout.tsx

✏️ Update It Like This:

tsx

Copy

"use client"

;

import

type

React

from

"react"

;

import

 { 

Inter

 } 

from

"next/font/google"

;

import

"./globals.css"

;

import

 { 

ThemeProvider

 }
