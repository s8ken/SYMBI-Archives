Could not open page.tsx in the editor.
The editor process exited with an error: (code 1).

To set up the editor integration, add something like REACT_EDITOR=atom to the .env.local file in your project folder and restart the development server.

🚨 
Fix: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'next-sanity/studio'"

Your project is 
missing 
next-sanity

, which is required to run 
Sanity Studio inside Next.js
.

✅ 
Step 1: Install 
next-sanity

Run the following command in your project folder:

bash

Copy

npm install next-sanity

If you continue to get dependency errors, try this instead:

bash

Copy

npm install next-sanity --legacy-peer-deps

✅ 
Why?
 This installs 
next-sanity
, which includes the missing 
next-sanity/studio
 module.

✅ 
Step 2: Restart Your Server

After installation, restart the Next.js development server:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Then go to:

👉 

http://localhost:3001/studio

🔥 
What If It Still Fails?

1️⃣ 
Confirm the installation

Run:

bash

Copy

npm list next-sanity

If it’s missing, install it again.

2️⃣ 
Delete 
node_modules
 & Reinstall Everything

bash

Copy

rm

 -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run dev

🚀 
Final Steps

After installing 
next-sanity
, 
/studio

should no longer show a 500 error.

If anything still isn’t working, 
send me the latest error log
 and I’ll debug further.

Try this and let me know! 🚀🔥
