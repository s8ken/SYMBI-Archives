🚨 Vercel Deployment Failed: 
app/api/replicate/route.ts
 Type Error

Your 
Next.js build failed
 because of an issue with 

app/api/replicate/route.ts

.

The error message:

"File '/vercel/path0/app/api/replicate/route.ts' is not a module."

This means 
Next.js cannot properly recognize or import this file
. Let's fix it!

🔍 Step 1: Identify the Issue

Possible Causes

Incorrect or missing TypeScript export in 
route.ts
.

Incorrect API route structure.

A syntax or TypeScript error in 
app/api/replicate/route.ts
.

🔧 Step 2: Fix the Issue

1️⃣ Check 
route.ts
 Exports

Open

app/api/replicate/route.ts
 in your editor.

Ensure it 
properly exports a Next.js API route
:

✅ 
Correct Format (
route.ts
)

ts

Copy

import

 { 

NextResponse

 } 

from

"next/server"

;

export

async

function

POST

(

req: Request

) {

try

 {

const

 body = 

await

 req.

json

();
