Sanity core packages
. Now, let's get 
Sanity Studio running
 🚀.

✅ 
Step 1: Start Your Next.js Server

npm run dev

Once it's running, check:

👉 

http://localhost:3001/studio

🔍

Make sure the 
Sanity Studio route exists
.

📌 Open 
app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx

bash

Copy

nano app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx

Paste this:

tsx

Copy

"use client"

;

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

"next-sanity/studio"

;

import

 config 

from

"../../../sanity.config"

;

export

default

function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

=

{config}

 />;
}

Save & exit:

Press 
CTRL + X

Press 
Y
 to confirm

Hit 
Enter

Then 
restart your server
:

🎯 
Final Checks
