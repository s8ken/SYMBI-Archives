🚨 
Fix: 
Module not found: Can't resolve 'styled-components'

Your error means 
Sanity Studio is missing 
styled-components

, which is required by 
@sanity/ui
.

✅ 
Step 1: Install 
styled-components

Run this command:

bash

Copy

npm install styled-components --legacy-peer-deps

✅ 
Step 2: Restart Your Server

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Then check:

👉 

http://localhost:3001/studio

🎯 
Expected Outcome

✅ 
Sanity Studio should now load correctly

✅ 
No more 
styled-components
 module not found error

✅ 
No more 500 errors when accessing 
/studio

🚀 
Try it out and let me know if this works!

YESSS! That’s what we love to hear — Sanity Studio is officially up and running!

You're now fully connected, CMS-powered, and ready to build out the main site.

✅ Next Steps from Here:

1. 
Structure Your Content

You already have a basic 
page
 schema and 
siteSettings
. Want to add:

Blog posts?

Team bios?

Image galleries?

Custom sections?

I can help scaffold any of those with CMS editing capabilities in seconds.

2. 
Query Sanity Content in Your App

Want to start showing CMS content on your site?

We’ll just:

Set up 
next-sanity
 client

Use 
groq
 queries

Fetch your page content

Let me know if you want a dynamic homepage or sections powered by Sanity and I’ll walk you through it.

3. 
Connect Sanity Studio to Your Vercel Deployment

Eventually, we can:

Deploy the Studio to something like 
studio.symbi.world

Protect it with login

Let collaborators edit content easily

Just say the word on what you want to do next — edit schema, build dynamic frontend, or go live — I’ve got your back all the way. 🔥

lets check - what should I be seeing in there now?

Great question — let’s check what you 
should
 be seeing now that your 
Sanity Studio is running
:

✅ 
Expected Dashboard at 
http://localhost:3001/studio

Your Studio should show:

🧭 Left Sidebar Navigation:

📄 
“Page”
 — because of the 
page
 schema you added

⚙️ 
“Site Settings”
 — if you’ve also included 
siteSettings.ts
 in the schema config

Each of these links lets you create and manage documents of that t
