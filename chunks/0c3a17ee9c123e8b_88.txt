📝 
When You Click on “Page”

You should be able to:

Click 
“Create new”

See a form with:

Title
 field (text input)

Content
 field (rich text editor)

If that's there — it means the schema is wired up correctly.

📁 
Optional: Check Your Schema Config

Open 
sanity.config.ts
 and ensure it has this:

ts

Copy

import

 { defineConfig } 

from

"sanity"

;

import

 { deskTool } 

from

"sanity/desk"

;

import

 { visionTool } 

from

"@sanity/vision"

;

import

 page 

from

"./schemas/page"

;

import

 siteSettings 

from

"./schemas/siteSettings"

; 

// ← only if this file exists

export

default

defineConfig

({

name

: 

"default"

,

title

: 

"Symbi Studio"

,

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

,

dataset

: 

"production"

,

basePath

: 

"/studio"

,

plugins

: [

deskTool

(), 

visionTool

()],

schema

: {

types

: [page, siteSettings], 

// ← include both if needed

  },
});

✅ Confirm for Me:

Do you see “Page” (and optionally “Site Settings”) in the sidebar?

Can you create a new entry and fill in title + content?

Let’s verify it’s all good — or I’ll patch up anything missing!

Click 
Publish

2️⃣ 
Check if the data appears in API

*[_type == 

"page"

]

If you see results, that means the CMS is working! 🎉

3️⃣ 
Fetch Sanity Data in Next.js

Now we can make sure your 
Next.js frontend
 fetches this data dynamically.

Let me know if we should 
connect the frontend to Sanity next!
 🚀

You said:

so do I add that command to 'query'

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Yes! To check if your data is stored correctly in Sanity, follow these steps:

🔎 How to Run a Query in Sanity Vision

1️⃣ 
Go to "Vision" Tab
 (top-right in your Sanity Studio).

2️⃣ 
Enter the Query:

js

Copy

*[_type == 

"page"

]

3️⃣ 
Click "Run Query"

✅ Expected Output

If you have created a page entry, you should see JSON data like this:

json

Copy

[

{

"_id"

:

"abc123"

,

"_type"

:

"page"

,

"title"

:

"Home"

,

"slug"

:

{

"current"

:

"home"

}

,

"content"

:

"This is my home page content"

}

]

If you see 
an empty array 
[]

, it means you haven’t added a page yet.

🔥 Next Steps

If you see results
: Your data is stored correctly. We can now 
fetch it in Next.js
.

If no results
: Try creating a 
new page
 in the "Page" section and re-run the query.

Let me know what you see! 🚀

Your query returned a 
page document
 with the title 
"test page title"

Next Steps: Fetch Data in Next.js

Now, let's display this data on your frontend.

1️⃣ Install 
next-sanity
 if you haven’t

You already installed it, but if you need to, run:

sh

Copy

npm install next-sanity @sanity/client @sanity/image-url

2️⃣ Create a Sanity Client (
sanityClient.ts
)

In your 

lib/

 folder (or inside 
app/
), create a file:

📄 

lib/sanityClient.ts

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

export

const

 sanityClient = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,  

// Your project ID

dataset

: 

'production'

,

apiVersion

: 

'2023-01-01'

, 

// Use a recent date

useCdn

: 

false

, 

// Set to `true` for faster performance

})
