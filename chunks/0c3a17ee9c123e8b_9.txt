 Example: Log input data (modify as needed)

console

.

log

(

"Replicate API Request:"

, body);

return

NextResponse

.

json

({ 

success

: 

true

, 

message

: 

"Replicate API is working!"

 });
  } 

catch

 (error) {

return

NextResponse

.

json

({ 

success

: 

false

, 

error

: 

"Error processing request."

 }, { 

status

: 

500

 });
  }
}

🔹 
Ensure 
export async function POST(req: Request) {}
 is present.

🔹 If you're using 
GET
, make sure it's exported as 
export async function GET() {}
.

2️⃣ Ensure Correct File Naming

The API route should be inside:

app/api/replicate/route.ts

❌ Wrong:

app/api/replicate.ts
 (should be inside 
replicate/
)

app/api/replicate/index.ts
 (Next.js expects 
route.ts
)

✅ Correct:

markdown

Copy

app/
  api/

    replicate/
      route.ts

3️⃣ Check for TypeScript Issues

Run this command locally 
before pushing
:

bash

Copy

npm run build

or

bash

Copy

yarn build

🔹 If it 
fails locally
, it will also fail on Vercel.

🔹 
Fix any errors
 shown in the terminal.

🚀 Step 3: Push the Fix & Deploy Again

Once fixed:

Stage & commit the fix
:

bash

Copy

git add app/api/replicate/route.ts
git commit -m 

"Fixed API route exports"

git push origin main

Check Vercel
: The deployment should automatically retry.

💡 Extra Debugging

If the error persists:

Share the 
route.ts
 file content
, and I'll help debug further.

Check 
Vercel Logs
:

Open 
Vercel Dashboard
 → Your project.

Click 
"Deployments"
 → Find the 
latest failed build
.

Click 
"View Logs"
 to see the exact error.

You said:

sorry where is route.ts and how do I open it?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

No worries! Let's 
find
 and 
open
 your 
route.ts
 file so you can edit it.

🔎 Step 1: Locate 
route.ts

Your 
Next.js API routes
 are usually inside:

📂 

app/api/replicate/route.ts

🔹 Open it via Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows)

Go to your 
project folder
:

bash

Copy

~/Documents/symbi/

Open these subfolders:

nginx

Copy

app

 → api → replicate

Look for 
route.ts

 inside the 
replicate
 folder.

Right-click

route.ts
 → Open with 
VS Code
, 
Notepad++
, or any text editor.

🖥️ Step 2: Open in VS Code (Recommended)

If you have 
Visual Studio Code
, you can quickly open it via terminal:

📌 Open Your Project in VS Code

Open a terminal and go to your project:

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi

Open the whole project in VS Code:

bash

Copy

code .

In 
VS Code
, open 
app/api/replicate/route.ts
 from the file explorer.

📌 Open 
route.ts
 Directly

bash

Copy

code ~/Documents/symbi/app/api/replicate/route.ts

🛠️ Step 3: Edit & Fix the File

Once open, 
replace its content with this fixed version
:

ts

Copy

import

 { 

NextResponse

 } 

from

"next/server"

;

export

async

function

POST

(

req: Request

) {

try

 {

const

 body = 

await

 req.

json

();

// Example: Log input data

console

.

log

(

"Replicate API Request:"

, body);

return

NextResponse

.

json

({ 

success

: 

true

, 

message

: 

"Replicate API is working!"

 });
  } 

catch

 (error) {

return

NextResponse

.

json

({ 

success

: 

false

, 

error

: 

"Error processing request."

 }, { 

status

: 

500

 });
  }
}

🚀 Step 4: Save & Deploy

Save the file
 (
Cmd + S
 on Mac / 
Ctrl + S
 on Windows).

Push the fix to GitHub
:

bash

Copy

git add app/api/replicate/route.ts
git commit -m 

"Fixed API route exports"

git push origin main

Vercel will auto-deploy
. If it still fails, check the 
Vercel logs
 for details.

No problem! It looks like you're trying to navigate through folders using the wrong command. 
Let's fix that and properly open your 
route.ts
