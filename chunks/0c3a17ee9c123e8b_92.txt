Perfect! 🎉 Now that 
lib/sanity.ts
 is set up, let’s wire it into your homepage.

✅ 3. 
Update 
app/page.tsx
 to Fetch from Sanity

Open the file:

bash

Copy

nano app/page.tsx

Then follow these steps:

📌 At the top, import the Sanity client:

tsx

Copy

import

 { sanityClient } 

from

"@/lib/sanity"

;

📌 Add this fetch function 
before
 the component:

tsx

Copy

async

function

getPageData

(

) {

const

 query = 

`*[_type == "page"]{ title, content }`

;

return

await

 sanityClient.

fetch

(query);
}

📌 Update your component to fetch and render the data:

tsx

Copy

export

default

async

function

Home

(

) {

const

 pages = 

await

getPageData

();

return

 (

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"container max-w-4xl px-4 py-16 md:py-24 text-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col items-center mb-8"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-8xl font-bold text-white mb-6"

>SYMBI

</
h1

>

<
div

className

=

"relative w-40 h-40 md:w-[160px] md:h-[160px]"

>

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"SYMBI Logo"

fill

className

=

"rounded-lg object-cover"

priority

sizes

=

"(max-width: 768px) 160px, 160px"

              />

</
div

>

</
div

>

          {/* Render Sanity Content */}
          {pages.map((page, index) => (

<
div

key

=

{index}

className

=

"text-white mt-8"

>

<
h2

className

=

"text-3xl font-semibold mb-2"

>{page.title}

</
h2

>
              {page.content?.map((block: any, i: number) => (

<
p

key

=

{i}

className

=

"text-lg"

>
                  {block.children?.[0]?.text}

</
p

>
              ))}

</
div

>
          ))}

</
div

>

</
main

>

</
div

>
  );
}

✅ 4. Save and Restart

If editing in 
nano
:

Press 
Ctrl + O
, then 
Enter

Press 
Ctrl + X

Then run your dev server if it’s not already running:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Go to: 
http://localhost:3001

You should now see the content from your Sanity CMS rendered dynamically on your site below the logo!

You said:

do you know where the component is based on what I shared earlier?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Yes — based on what you previously shared and uploaded, your 
animated content
 (like the typing words) and structure for 
SYMBI
 and the logo were all located inside the main layout of 
app/page.tsx
.

Here’s the breakdown based on your last working version:

✅ 
Structure Summary

Inside 
app/page.tsx
, your component looked like this:

tsx

Copy

<div className=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"container max-w-4xl px-4 py-16 md:py-24 text-center"

>

      {/* Static SYMBI heading */}

<
h1

className

=

"text-8xl font-bold text-white mb-6"

>SYMBI

</
h1

>

      {/* Logo below heading */}

<
div

className

=

"relative w-40 h-40 md:w-[160px] md:h-[160px]"

>

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"SYMBI Logo"

fill

className

=

"rounded-lg object-cover"

priority

sizes

=

"(max-width: 768px) 160px, 160px"

 />

</
div

>

      {/* Animated text below logo */}

<
div

className

=

"mt-6"

>

<
AnimatedWords

 />

</
div

>

</
div

>

</
main

>
</div>

The 
AnimatedWords
 component was likely imported from a separate component file like:

tsx

Copy

import

AnimatedWords

from

"@/components/AnimatedWords"

;

🧠 So your page 
component is 
Home()
 in 
app/page.tsx

, and inside that are:

SYMBI
 heading (
<h1>
)

Logo image

A component (likely 
AnimatedWords
) for animated text — possibly created with Framer Motion.

🔎 Want to Confirm Where That Component Is?

If you're unsure where 
AnimatedWords
 lives, just run:

bash

Copy

grep -r 

"AnimatedWords"

 .

This will search your codebase for the component's location and usage.
