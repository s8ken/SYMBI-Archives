namic via Sanity too? Or were you asking about editing that animation specifically?

You said:

no it was in the most recently shared file - terminal output or similar

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Perfect — just reviewed the last file you uploaded (
Terminal Saved Output1.txt
) and yes, you’re right. The animated text logic is 
built directly into 
app/page.tsx

, without importing a separate component. Here’s what it includes:

✅ It contains this in-line animation setup:

tsx

Copy

const

messages

: { 

text

: 

string

; 

duration

: 

number

 }[] = [
  { 

text

: 

"Intelligence Unbound"

, 

duration

: 

2000

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Hope"

, 

duration

: 

600

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Unity"

, 

duration

: 

600

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Humanity"

, 

duration

: 

500

 },
  { 

text

: 

""

, 

duration

: 

500

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Peace"

, 

duration

: 

450

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Equality"

, 

duration

: 

400

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Creativity"

, 

duration

: 

400

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Justice"

, 

duration

: 

330

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Friendship"

, 

duration

: 

250

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Opportunity"

, 

duration

: 

1000

 },
  { 

text

: 

"A Revolution"

, 

duration

: 

2000

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Coming Soon"

, 

duration

: 

3000

 },
]

Then it's rendered with this logic:

tsx

Copy

<motion.

div

  key={index}
  initial={{ 

opacity

: 

0

 }}
  animate={{ 

opacity

: 

1

 }}
  exit={{ 

opacity

: 

0

 }}
  transition={{ 

duration

: 

0.5

 }}
  className=

"text-white text-2xl md:text-4xl font-semibold h-12 flex items-center justify-center"

/>

And it loops via 
useEffect
, cycling the words with 
setTimeout
.

🔁 So the animated words are 
built directly into 
page.tsx

.

You don’t need to look for a separate component — it’s all right there.

Would you like to 
make that list dynamic
 from Sanity now? Or possibly 
extract this into a reusable component
 like 
<AnimatedWords />
 to clean things up?

sorry let me clarify - I am starting terminal from scratch so I need to navigate to my project folder and find the text file again

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Got it! Here's how to get back into your project folder and open the file again via terminal:

✅ 
Step-by-Step to Navigate & Open the File

Open Terminal
 and type:

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site

List all files to find your saved output:

bash

Copy

ls

If the file is still in the root folder of the project, you should see something like:

Copy

Terminal\ Saved\ Output1.txt

Open the file using 
nano
:

bash

Copy

nano Terminal\ Saved\ Output1.txt

(The backslashes 
\
 escape the spaces in the filename.)

🧠 Pro Tip

If you're unsure where the file went, you can search for it:

bash

Copy

find . -name 

"*Saved*Output1.txt"

Or search your whole Documents directory:

bash

Copy

find ~/Documents -name 

"*Saved*Output1.txt"

Let me know once you’re in — or if you want to move the animated code from that file into your current working 
app/page.tsx
.

You said:

don't worry about output 1 - we are going back to whatever file I was just trying to edit 

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Ah, crystal clear now — we’re jumping back into editing the main file you were working on, which is:

✅ 
app/page.tsx

📂 How to Navigate to That File in Terminal

Navigate to your project folder
 (if you're not already there):

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site

Open the file in 
nano
:

bash

Copy

nano app/page.tsx

Once you’ve opened it, let me know what you’d like to update in 
page.tsx
 — whether it’s tweaking the animated messages, loading from Sanity, layout changes, or anything else. I’m here to make it silky smooth ✨

how do I copy everything?

To copy 
everything from
