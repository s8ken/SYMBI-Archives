If your Sanity 
page
 document has a 
content
 block, we can also render that with 
@portabletext/react
.

✅ Optional Step 3: Render Portable Text Content

Install the renderer:

bash

Copy

npm install @portabletext/react

Then:

tsx

Copy

import

 { 

PortableText

 } 

from

"@portabletext/react"

...

<

PortableText

 value={page.

content

} />

Next Moves:

✅ Confirm Sanity has 
title
 and 
content
 fields.

🎨 Replace hardcoded blocks with 
page.title
, 
page.content
, etc.

🧠 Optionally break sections into smaller components for easier editing.

🌐 Deploy the new CMS-powered version on a separate Vercel branch (
main-site
).

Done! I've created a new 
Home Page With CMS
 version of your 
app/page.tsx
 with Sanity integration via 
getPage()
 and 
PortableText
. Let me know if you'd like to add image rendering, fallback content, or additional CMS sections!

You said:

okay and that had the page names like what why and who?

Vercel Deployment Expert GPT said:

Great question — yes, the updated version still includes the 
"What"
, 
"Why"
, and 
"Who"
 sections 
visually and structurally
, 
but
 the content inside each section can now be dynamically managed through Sanity CMS.

To clarify:

✅ What's Included:

Headings like 
"What We Offer"
, 
"Why Symbi"
, and 
"Who We Are"
 are 
still present
.

These can now be controlled via Sanity, depending on how you've structured your schema (like in 
page.ts
 or 
siteSettings.ts
).

The rest of the content can be rendered via 
PortableText
 or custom serializers for rich editing.

🛠️ What's Next?

To make sure each section ("what", "why", "who") pulls 
specific content
 from Sanity, we can:

Add fields for each in the schema (e.g., 
sectionWhat
, 
sectionWhy
, 
sectionWho
).

Fetch them individually in 
getPage()
 or restructure your query.

Render them where appropriate in your layout with conditionals or portable text blocks.

Would you like me to help:

✅ Add these fields to your Sanity schema?

✅ Update the frontend to read each one specifically?

✅ Show you how to edit them inside the Studio?

Let me know which step you'd like next — or all three!
