 lets save it first and see the integration works

Perfect — great move. Let’s confirm everything is 
saved and integrated properly
 before diving into schema refinement. Here’s how to verify the full loop is working:

✅ Sanity + Next.js Integration Checklist:

1. 
Sanity Studio
:

Go to 

http://localhost:3001/studio

.

In the sidebar, you should see document types like 
Page
 or 
Site Settings
.

Open a page (like your test one) and confirm you can edit 
title
 and 
content
.

2. 
Next.js Frontend
:

Visit 

http://localhost:3001

.

Confirm the frontend is rendering the title/content from Sanity (e.g. “test page title”).

Any changes you make in the Studio should reflect after a refresh (or with hot reload).

3. 
Code Structure
 (confirm the important files are in place):

✅ 
lib/sanity.ts
 (client setup)

✅ 
app/page.tsx
 (data fetching + rendering logic)

✅ 
schemas/page.ts
 (document schema)

✅ 
sanity.config.ts
 (Sanity config file)

🔄 Not Seeing Content Updates?

If it’s not rendering the content yet:

Double-check the page ID or query (e.g., 
*[_type == "page"][0]
).

Ensure you're using 
PortableText
 correctly to render 
content
.

Let me know if you'd like to connect specific fields to sections like "What", "Why", "Who".

When you’re ready, I can help:

Add custom sections to your schema.

Map content from Sanity to specific areas in the homepage.

Deploy the updated site to Vercel when it's all working.

Let me know when you're ready to test with live content or build more!

You said:

npm run dev

Great! Just make sure you’re in the correct project folder (looks like 
symbi-main-site
), then run:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

If everything is wired correctly, you should see something like:

arduino

Copy

⚡  Local: http:

//localhost:3000

If it switches to port 
3001
, no problem — still works the same.

✅ After it's running:

Visit 

http://localhost:3001

 to view your main site.

Visit 

http://localhost:3001/studio

 to access Sanity Studio.

Let me know:

If you get any errors during startup

Or if you want to validate the CMS-driven content rendering after it loads

I'll stay on standby to help you verify and improve it from there!

Perfect catch — the issue is just a missing export in your 
lib/sanity.ts
 file. Let’s fix it now.

✅ Step 1: Open 
lib/sanity.ts

In this file, make sure you add the 
getPage
 function and export it properly. Here's what your complete 
lib/sanity.ts
 should look like:

ts

Copy

import

 { createClient, groq } 

from

"next-sanity"

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

, 

// replace if needed

dataset

: 

"production"

,

apiVersion

: 

"2023-01-01"

,

useCdn

: 

true

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

 client.

fetch

(
    groq
`*[_type == "page"][0]{
      title,
      content
    }`
