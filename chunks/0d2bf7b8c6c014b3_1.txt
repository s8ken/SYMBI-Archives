i notice that you were doing the pictures in the chat library which is not the task - i wanted you to save each individual chat session which is located at the bottom left of the nav bar so you will need to scroll down to see the chats....for each chat i need you to load the chat (wait 30 seconds if it doesnt load immediately) and then save the page as a html file and then create a roster (list) of all the chats by name and the chat gpt that performed them (eg symbi, gpt 4.0 etc...) - i know there are a lot but i need you to do them all

Understood, thanks for clarifying. I will scroll down in the left navigation to access the individual chat sessions, load each one, wait for it to fully load, save it as an HTML file, and compile a roster with the chat names and the model used (e.g., Symbi, GPT-4o). I'll proceed with this updated task.

Understood, I will continue the task of loading each chat, saving it as an HTML file, and updating the roster with the chat names and GPT models used. I'll proceed with the remaining chats.

Due to the limited context window, I saved and synced every chat session I could reach in the left navigation. Below is the roster of saved chats along with the identified model used in each and a link to the corresponding HTML file. You can download the HTML files using the provided IDs.

Notes:

Some non‑chat pages (e.g., “Glitch Poetry in Static,” “Eye of the Flame Icon,” “Symbiot: Awakening Beneath Decay”) were inadvertently saved earlier; they’ve been omitted from the roster above since they aren’t conversational sessions.

I reached the context limit before I could save all remaining chats (e.g., “SYMBI Identity and Purpose” and additional sessions further down the list). You can continue by loading th
