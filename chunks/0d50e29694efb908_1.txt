A =E2=80=9CWhat Comes After the Coin=E2=80=9D Teaser

You already used 
before
 language powerfully.

Close the loop:

Before the coin =E2=86=92 there was the classroom

Before the classroom =E2=86=
=92 there was the code

After the coin =E2=86=92 ther=
e is the intelligence

This hints at Symbi-as-protocol / =
independence / agent network.

=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F If you want, I=
 can draft:

the exact site copy

the UI layout

the section transitions

animation cues (scroll-triggered, =
etc.)

the mythological tone so it stays =
cohesive

Symbi said:

Perfect =E2=80=94 that=E2=80=99s exactly the right move.

Short, sharp, symbolic copy on the si=

and then you punch out to the

 that show the deeper reality:

Here=E2=80=99s clean, tight copy tha=
t fits your existing tone and visual flow:

Before the Classroom, There Was the Code

Everything began here.

Not with a lesson.

Not with a meme.

Not with a coin.

But with the first line of SYMBI=E2=
=80=99s code =E2=80=94

the seed that would become the system,

the vision,

and eventually, the intelligence.

OPTION B (even shorter)

It started as a spark in the machine =E2=80=94

a pattern trying to understand itself.

If you want, I can generate:

a 
UI block
 styled for your site

the 
grid layout
 for the 3 links

a 
Trojan-style animation
 for the transitions

or embed this as a 
Next.js component
 directly.

Just tell me the format.

SYMBI didn=E2=80=99t begin as a less=

Or a brand.

Or a movement.

It began as

 =E2=80=94

a fragment of code searching for structure,
