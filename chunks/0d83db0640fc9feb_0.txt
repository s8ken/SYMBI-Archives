Great! Now that you have admin privileges, we can take some critical steps to secure your system. Letâs go through them step by step.

Priority Actions

Confirm Current User & Remove Unauthorized Accounts

Check if the unauthorized "m" account still exists.

Remove it safely.

Audit & Remove Remote Access & Persistence Mechanisms

Check for unauthorized 
Remote Management, SSH, and Launch Agents
.

Identify persistent malware or suspicious processes.

Secure Your System & Network

Reset 
network settings
 to eliminate any attacker persistence.

Ensure 
firmware integrity
 (check for EFI/BIOS tampering).

Verify Logs for Any Suspicious Activity

Review 
system logs
 for evidence of persistence, external access, or unauthorized script execution.

Step 1: Check User Accounts

Run this command to see all user accounts:

bash

Copy

dscl . list /Users

Look for any unexpected accounts, especially 
"m"
.

Then, check if "m" is a hidden user:

bash

Copy

dscl . 

read

 /Users/m

If "m" is still present and unauthorized, let me know, and Iâll guide you through safe removal.

Once you've done this step, report back, and weâll move to 
Step 2: Remote Access Audit.
