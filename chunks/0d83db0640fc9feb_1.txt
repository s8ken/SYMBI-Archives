Yes, let's run that command again to list all user accounts, excluding system accounts:

bash

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

What to Look For:

The expected users should include:

Your primary admin account

"djlcl"
 (which you confirmed as legitimate)

Standard system accounts like "root", "daemon", "nobody", etc.

Unexpected accounts
 (such as "m") should raise a red flag.

Once you run the command, paste the output here, and weâll determine the next step.

yep okay so last week when we used dscl . list /Users | grep -v '^_'

ChatGPT said:

Got it! If we ran that command last time and found 
"m"
, we need to check if it still exists.

Step 1: Run the User List Command Again

Run this in Terminal:

bash

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

ð 
Post the output here
 so we can see if "m" is still present.

If "m" is Still There

We'll:

Check its details.

Safely remove it.

If "m" is 
gone
, we move to the 
next security check
 (remote access audit). Let me know what you find!

Thatâs unusualânormally, at least the main admin account should appear. Letâs double-check to make sure we get a complete and accurate user list.

Step 1: Verify All User Accounts Again

Run this alternate command to list all users, including any hidden accounts:

bash

Copy

dscl . -list /Users

ð 
If this returns no users
, it could indicate:

A permissions issue preventing the command from listing accounts.

sorry I mean system accounts eg nobody

ChatGPT said:

Got it! If you're seeing 
only system accounts
 (like 
nobody
, 
daemon
, etc.), but 
not your main admin user
, that could be a sign of something strangeâpotentially an attempt to hide users.

Step 2: Check If Your Admin User Still Exists

Run this to verify your main admin account still exists:

bash

Copy

dscl . 

read

 /Users/$(

whoami

)

This should return details about your currently logged-in user. If it 
fails
 or doesn't return your expected username, thatâs a red flag.

Step 3: List All Users With Full Details

Try this to list all users with their home directories:

bash

Copy

dscl . -list /Users NFSHomeDirectory

This helps confirm if any accounts are being 
hidden
 by relocating or altering home directories.

Step 4: List Admin Users

To confirm which accounts have admin privileges, run:

bash

Copy

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

ð 
Look for unexpected admin users.
 If an attacker promoted an unauthorized account to admin, it would show up here.

Next Steps:

If 
your expected user accounts appear
, we move on to auditing 
remote access settings
.

If 
something looks wrong
 (missing users, extra admins, or hidden accounts), weâll dig deeper.

ð 
Let me know what these commands return!

Analysis of Your Findings:

The "m" account is 
no longer present

Running 
dscl . read /Users/m
 resulted in 
"DS Error: -14136 (eDSRecordNotFound)"
, confirming the account has been removed.

List of existing users:

lcl

root
SJA

"lcl"
 appears to be your primary account.

"SJA"
 is an unexpected account. We need to check if this is legitimate or suspicious.

Next Steps: Investigate "SJA"

Since 
"SJA"
 is not a system account, we should check its details.

Step 1: Read User Details for "SJA"

Run:

bash

Copy

dscl . 

read

 /Users/SJA

ð 
If this account is unauthorized
, weâll move to removal.

Step 2: Check Admin Privileges

To confirm if 
"SJA"
 has admin rights:

bash

Copy

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

ð 
If 
"SJA"
 is listed as an admin, it's a red flag.

Let me know the results!
