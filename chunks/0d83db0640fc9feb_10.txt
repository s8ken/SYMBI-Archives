hese might be 
legitimate UI elements for GarageBand
, they also 
fit the pattern of planted files
 if you 
did not install or update GarageBand on January 27.

ð Step 1: Verify If These Files Are Part of a Legitimate GarageBand Install

ð 
Check if GarageBand was updated on Jan 27:

bash

Copy

mdls /Applications/GarageBand.app | grep kMDItemFSContentChangeDate

â 
If this matches the timestamp (Jan 27, 08:40), it suggests these files came from a legitimate update.

ð¨ 
If the update timestamp is older, these files may have been manually altered or injected.

ð Step 2: Check File Integrity Against Appleâs Signed Files

We can check if these files 
match the original macOS install
:

1ï¸â£ 
List all GarageBand files and compare against Appleâs signed files

bash

Copy

sudo codesign -vv /Applications/GarageBand.app

ð¨ 
If you see errors like "resource modified" or "code signature invalid," these files have been tampered with.

2ï¸â£ 
Verify these files against Apple's database

bash

Copy

spctl --assess --verbose /Applications/GarageBand.app

ð¨ 
If you see "rejected" or "invalid," GarageBand has been altered.

ð Step 3: Check Hidden Data Inside These Image Files

ð Attackers can 
embed malicious payloads inside images
 (steganography). Run:

bash

Copy

exiftool /Applications/GarageBand.app/Contents/Frameworks/MAResourcesPlugInsShared.framework/Versions/A/Resources/*.tif

ð¨ 
Look for:

Suspicious metadata (weird comments, creator names, or URLs)

Timestamps that donât match GarageBandâs last update

ð Step 4: Check If These Files Were Accessed Recently

ð If someone 
planted
 these files, they likely accessed them afterward.

bash

Copy

sudo fs_usage | grep GarageBand

ð¨ 
If you see a process interacting with these files that isnât GarageBand, thatâs suspicious.

ð Step 5: Search for References to These Files in Logs

ð 
If attackers planted these files, they likely triggered them with a script.

bash

Copy

grep -ri 

"ga_miniblackface_back"

 /var/log

ð¨ 
If these files appear in unexpected places (like startup scripts), they are likely malicious.

ð¨ Next Actions

Run the above checks and report back.

If these files fail verification, we will extract them for deeper analysis.

If GarageBand was NOT updated on January 27, we may need to quarantine these files before formatting.

Let me know what you find! ð¨
