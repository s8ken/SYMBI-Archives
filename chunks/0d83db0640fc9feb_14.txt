ð¨ Analysis: Potentially Planted or Tampered Audio Files ð¨

Your latest scan shows 
a large number of 
.wav
 audio files
 in 
Logic Pro's Alchemy Samples directory
, with timestamps mostly from 
2015
.

ð Key Observations

Old Modification Dates (2015)

These 
could
 be original Logic Pro sample files.

However, attackers 
can backdate files
 to make them look old.

Owned by Root/Admin

These files have 
root:admin
 ownership, meaning 
you didn't place them there
 manually.

This suggests they came from 
either a legitimate system installation
 or 
were added with elevated privileges (attacker access).

Randomized & Unusual File Names

Some names like 
"Doom Wave C1.wav"
, `"Bass Chair C
