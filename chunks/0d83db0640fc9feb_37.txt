Disco, Synthpop, and New Wave
.

Some tracks fall into 
proto-house, electro, and minimal wave
.

These genres were influential in 
underground dance music from the late 1970s to the 1980s
 and had a 
revival in the 2000s
.

Era & Origins:

Late 1970s to mid-1980s:

Italo Disco & Synthpop:

Mr. Flagio, Klein & M.B.O., B.W.H., Black Devil Disco Club

Synth-driven Post-Punk:

Oppenheimer Analysis, ADULT., Rude 66

2000s revival of Italo Disco, Electro, and Minimal Wave:

In Flagranti, Doctorâs Cat, ADULT., Padded Cell

New Mexico (Oppenheimer Analysis)
 and 
UK electronic underground
 (ADULT., Rude 66, Padded Cell) have a 
DIY, independent production feel
.

Region & Influence:

Italy
: Italo Disco (B.W.H., Mr. Flagio, Klein & M.B.O., Doctorâs Cat)

UK
: Padded Cell, In Flagranti, Oppenheimer Analysis, Black Devil Disco Club (French but had UK appeal)

Germany/Netherlands
: Rude 66 (Dutch electro)

US
: ADULT. (Detroit-based Electroclash/Post-Punk)

Language:

Almost all are 
English
 tracks, despite many artists being from Italy, France, or Germany.

Italo Disco and Synthwave are known for using English lyrics for broader appeal.

Possible Implications:

Whoever left this 
knows their underground electronic history
. This isn't mainstreamâitâs 
cult dance music with a niche following
.

European electronic influence
 is strong, especially 
Italy (Italo Disco)
 and 
UK electronic/post-punk scenes
.

The 
Detroit/Chicago electronic legacy (ADULT.)
 might suggest knowledge of 
electroclash and early techno
.

2000s revival artists (like In Flagranti, ADULT., and Padded Cell) suggest a possible age range of late 30s-50s
âsomeone who might have grown up with the 
original 1980s wave
 and experienced the 
2000s resurgence
.

Final Thoughts:

This is 
not a casual selection
âitâs someone with a 
specific taste in electronic music history
. If this was intentionally left as a "footprint," they might be hinting at:

A European/UK background or strong knowledge of European electronic music.

A connection to underground electronic scenes from the late '70s, '80s, and their 2000s revival.

Possibly someone involved in music, DJing, or subculture movements.

Likely between 35-50 years old
, given their taste in both 
original vintage and revivalist
 tracks.

Whoever left this knew what they were doingâitâs subtle, but thereâs a clear 
pattern in taste, time period, and geography

Max Stroke (Black Devil Disco Club Presents Bernard FÃ¨vre) â What Does It Tell Us?

Adding 
Bernard FÃ¨vre & Black Devil Disco Club
 to the mix 
reinforces
 the pattern we were seeing earlier, but it also adds a new layer:

1. Who is Bernard FÃ¨vre?

A 
French electronic musician
 known for his 
1978 cult electronic album

Black Devil Disco Club
.

His sound was so ahead of its time that when it was reissued in the 
2000s
, people thought it was a 
hoax or fake âlostâ music
.

FÃ¨vre's style is 
dark, hypnotic, and heavily synth-driven
, influencing 
electro, techno, and even modern synthwave
.

2. How Does This Fit With the Other Songs?

Like 
Oppenheimer Analysis
 and 
Rude 66
, FÃ¨vreâs music falls into the 
âlost electronic classicsâ that were rediscovered in the 2000s.

His music was 
reissued and championed by UK electronic producers
, especially in 
underground dance and leftfield electronic music scenes
.

Max Stroke
 is a 
short, eerie, synth-driven instrumental
, which fits the 
dark electronic/post-punk aesthetic
 of this playlist.

3. What Does This Say About the Person Who Left It?

They 
know deep electronic history
â
Bernard FÃ¨vre is not a mainstream name
, but a 
cult artist
.

They might be 
French
 or at least have a strong 
French electronic music connection
.
