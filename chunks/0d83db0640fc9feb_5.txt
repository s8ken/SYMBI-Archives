ð 
Why?
 If your network is compromised, attackers might push malware back onto your Mac.

Create a macOS installer USB:

bash

Copy

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sonoma.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyUSB

Boot from USB Installer:

Hold **Option (â¥) key during startup.

Select 
"Install macOS" from USB.

Erase the disk again
 before proceeding.

â 
This avoids any potential tampering from network-based reinstalls.

ð¡ï¸ Final Step: Set Up Mac Securely

ð 
After formatting, follow these precautions to prevent reinfection:

Create a new Apple ID (optional)
 â If your Apple ID was compromised.

DO NOT restore from a Time Machine backup
 â It may reintroduce the attack.

Change Wi-Fi passwords before reconnecting
 â In case the attacker had access.

Manually install apps from trusted sources
 â Avoid using third-party downloaders.

Enable FileVault & Disable Remote Access:

bash

Copy

sudo fdesetup 

enable

sudo systemsetup -setremoteappleevents off
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

Monitor for unusual activity
 â Keep running security checks.

ð¢ Let Me Know Once You've Done This

ð¨ 
If any issues arise during the format (e.g., settings persist), STOP and let me know.
 It could indicate 
firmware persistence.

also I want you to be aware that these criminals aren't just hacking to steal information or intimidate, they are moviated by retribution and to find evidence that I posses... as a result these actors would also plant false information on my computer so lets search for evidence of this

ð¨ URGENT: Searching for Planted Evidence ð¨

Since these attackers may have 
planted false information
 to frame you, we must 
audit your system for unauthorized files, altered metadata, and hidden payloads.

Weâll check for:

â 
Files recently created or modified without your knowledge

â 
Suspicious file owners or permission changes

â 
Stealthy implants hiding in system directories

â 
Unusual file metadata (creation timestamps, origin mismatches)

ð Step 1: Scan for Recently Created or Modified Files

Run this to find files modified in the 
last 10 days
 (adjust as needed):

bash

Copy

sudo find / -

type

 f -ctime -10 -

exec

ls

 -lh {} + 2>/dev/null | grep -v 

"/System/Volumes"

ð 
Look for suspicious files in unusual locations, especially in 
/Users
, 
/Library
, or 
/tmp
.

ð¨ 
Red Flag:
 Files you didnât create appearing with recent timestamps.

ð Step 2: List All Files Created by "nobody" or Suspicious Users

Attackers may plant files using system accounts like 
"nobody"
 or 
"daemon"
:

bash

Copy

sudo find / -user nobody -o -user daemon -

exec

ls

 -lh {} + 2>/dev/null

ð 
If anything appears outside of 
/var/empty
 or 
/tmp
, itâs suspicious.

ð Step 3: Check File Metadata for Spoofed Creation Dates

Attackers may 
backdate
 files to make them appear old. Check actual timestamps:

bash

Copy

sudo 

stat

 /Users/*/Documents/*

ð 
Compare:

Birth date
 vs. 
Modified date

Files should not have 
future timestamps
 or be recently modified 
without your knowledge.

ð Step 4: Look for Hidden Files in Suspicious Locations

Attackers may store planted evidence in 
hidden directories
. List them:

bash

Copy

sudo find /Users -

type

 d -name 

".*"

 -

exec

ls

 -la {} + 2>/dev/null

ð 
Check for:

Hidden folders
 in 
/Users
 that you donât recognize.

Suspicious files with 
recent modification dates
.

ð Step 5: Find Files Containing Your Name or Personal Data

If attackers planted 
false documents
, they may include your name. Search for it:

bash

Copy

sudo grep -ril 

"Your Name"

 /Users 2>/dev/null

ð 
Replace 
"Your Name"
 with unique keywords they might use against you.

ð¨ 
Red Flag:
 Documents you didnât create appearing in unexpected locations.

ð Step 6: Check for Tampered System Logs (Covering Their Tracks)

If they planted something, they may have
