 looks like you're referring to 
"Stream with Thing"
 in the context of 
Telegram Web clients with elevated privileges
. If you mean 
Telegram Web versions
 that might have 
extra features or special access
, let's clarify a few things:

1. What is "Stream with Thing"?

If this phrase appeared in one of the Telegram-related repositories I shared, it likely refers to 
a custom feature within a modified Telegram Web client
. "Stream" could refer to:

Streaming media (videos, voice messages, live calls)

Streaming data (messages, bots, file transfers, etc.)

A WebRTC-based streaming function in Telegram clients

A specific method of interacting with Telegram's API

Can you clarify 
where exactly you saw this phrase
? Was it in a GitHub repo? A readme file? A discussion thread?

2. Finding the Most "Powerful" Telegram Web Client

You're looking for 
an advanced Telegram Web client
 with 
special privileges
. Hereâs what we can do:

ð Options:

Modified Telegram Web Clients (Unofficial)

Some forks of Telegram Web 
unlock hidden features
, like:

Viewing deleted messages

Accessing hidden API methods

Bypassing restrictions

More customization options

MTProto API Clients

Some developers create 
custom Telegram clients
 with 
direct access to the MTProto API
, giving more control.

Forked Web Clients

Examples:
 Forks of Telegram WebK, Telegram WebZ, or completely independent Web clients.

â ï¸ Important Notes:

Many 
"special privilege" clients
 can violate Telegramâs 
Terms of Service
.

Using 
unofficial clients
 might 
get your account restricted or flagged
.

I can help you 
set up and run
 a Telegram client 
but wonât guide you through bypassing security features Telegram put in place
.

3. Whatâs Next?

Do you want to 
run a specific GitHub repo
 for Telegram Web?

Do you want a 
list of modified Telegram Web clients
 that offer 
"special privileges"
?

Are you looking for 
something specific like accessing deleted messages, removing limits, or unlocking API methods
?

Let me know how 
deep you want to go
 into this. ð

egarding administrative privileges, it's important to note that any client, whether official or third-party, must adhere to Telegram's API limitations and security protocols. This means that actions requiring administrative rights within a group or channel can only be performed if the user has been granted those rights by the group's creator or an existing admin. Simply using a different client does not confer additional privileges beyond what your account has been assigned.â

For instance, discussions in the Telegram Desktop GitHub repository highlight that certain administrative actions are restricted based on the user's assigned permissions:â

STREAM WITH Option: Only creators can use the "Stream With" option, even if other admins have the "Manage Live Stream" privilege. â

Understanding "Stream With" in Telegram

The 
"Stream With"
 option in Telegram is a 
privileged feature
 that only 
group/channel creators
 can use, even if other admins have "Manage Live Stream" privileges.

1. What is the "Stream With" Option?

This feature is related to 
Telegram Live Streams
.

Only 
group/channel creators
 can initiate a "Stream With" session.

Even 
admins
 (who have "Manage Live Stream" privileges) 
cannot
 start a "Stream With" unless they are the actual creator.

2. Why Do Only Creators Have Access?

Telegram enforces this 
as a security measure
 to prevent unauthorized admins from taking full control over streaming.

Even if an admin has the "Manage Live Stream" privilege, they 
cannot
 start "Stream With."

This prevents 
malicious admins
 from hijacking the stream.

3. Can This Be Bypassed with a Custom Client?

No.
 The restriction is 
enforced at Telegramâs server level
, meaning:

Even a 
custom Telegram Web client
 cannot override this.

The 
MTProto API
 does not allow a non-creator to access this feature.

This is 
not a
