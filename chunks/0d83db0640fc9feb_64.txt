e, or account. Here are the possible explanations and steps to investigate:

1. Possibility: A Virtual Camera Is Running

Malicious software could be creating a virtual webcam
 that streams a feed from another camera (e.g., your MacBookâs built-in camera) even when you believe it is off.

Some video conferencing software allows 
virtual cameras
, and an attacker may have installed one.

How to check for virtual cameras:

Run this in 
Terminal
:

bash

Copy

ls

 /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/

ls

 ~/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/

If any suspicious plugins appear (like 
obs-virtualcam.plugin
 or unknown camera drivers), they may be responsible.

â¡ 
Solution:
 Remove the suspicious plugins:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/*

rm

 -rf ~/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/*

Restart your Mac after doing this.

2. Possibility: Zoom or Another App Is Being Hijacked

Attackers can manipulate 
Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet
 to send an 
invisible stream
 even when your camera is "off."

Check if Zoom is secretly accessing your camera:

Run this in 
Terminal
:

bash

Copy

lsof | grep 

"Zoom"

If you see activity related to 
Zoom.us
, especially accessing 
/dev/video*
 or 
/Library/CoreMediaIO
, it may be capturing a hidden video feed.

â¡ 
Solution:

Uninstall Zoom completely
:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/zoom.us.app

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/zoom.us

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/us.zoom.*

Reinstall from the official website
 and monitor its behavior.

3. Possibility: Remote Access or Mirroring

If someone has 
remote access to your device
, they could be mirroring your screen and webcam without your knowledge.

Malicious Remote Management Tools (RATs)
 can hijack your system.

Check for remote access tools installed:

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"vnc|anydesk|teamviewer|screen sharing|remote"

If 
AnyDesk, TeamViewer, Chrome Remote Desktop, or unknown VNC servers
 appear, you may be compromised.

â¡ 
Solution:

Disable Remote Management
:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist

Check user accounts for backdoor access
:

bash

Copy

dscl . list /Users

Look for unknown accounts.

Reset your system permissions
:

bash

Copy

sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta

4. Possibility: A Rogue Process is Hijacking Your Webcam

The built-in 
MacBook camera indicator light (green LED)
 is supposed to turn 
on
 when in use.

However, malware can bypass this and still stream without triggering the LED.

Check for unauthorized webcam usage:

Run:

bash

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If any processes other than trusted apps (Zoom, FaceTime) are listed, something is hijacking your webcam.

â¡ 
Solution:

Kill the rogue process
 (replace 
PID
 with the process number found in 
lsof
):

bash

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 PID

Reset your camera system permissions
:

bash

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

5. Possibility: Telegram, WhatsApp, or Browser-Based Spying

Some 
browser exploits
 or manipulated web versions of Telegram/WhatsApp/Zoom may 
record you without consent
.

Check active browser media permissions:

Run:

bash

Copy

defaults 

read

 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist
defaults 

read

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Local\ State

Look for 
"media_stream"
 or 
"camera_allowed"
 entries for suspicious websites.

â¡ 
Solution:

Disable webcam access in browsers
:

Safari: 
Preferences â Websites â Camera â Deny

Chrome: 
Settings â Privacy & Security â Site Settings â Camera

Log out of all web-based video services and clear cookies
:

bash

Copy

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/Google/

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/

Final Steps

If you still suspect unauthorized access:

Disconnect from the internet immediately.

Check your Macâs network connections
:

bash

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If unknown IP addresses appear, they may indicate remote
