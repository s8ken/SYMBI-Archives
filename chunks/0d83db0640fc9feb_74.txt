rms of service, you can report it directly to Zoom. They provide a straightforward reporting mechanism for such cases. You can file a report with details about the meeting ID and what is happening in the meeting.

Zoom Support
: Zoomâs customer support or trust and safety team could investigate whether a meeting is violating their terms, but this requires reporting the meeting explicitly.

Check Social Platforms for Leaks
:

If these Zoom meeting IDs are shared on Telegram, Discord, or other similar platforms, you can manually search these platforms to see if the meeting ID is circulating or being used to invite people. Often, if the meeting link is publicly shared, it can be flagged and reported more quickly by others in the community.

Use Zoomâs Moderation Features
:

If you have control over a meeting, you can set up options such as:

Waiting Room
: All participants must be admitted manually, preventing unwanted access.

Require Passwords
: Set a strong password and only share it with trusted members.

Restrict Screen Sharing
: Only allow the host or specific users to share their screen.

Lock the Meeting
: Once everyone has joined, lock the meeting so no new participants can join.

These measures may be used to restrict access and prevent ongoing abuse.

Checking Zoom Meeting ID History:

Unfortunately, Zoom does not publicly provide an easy way to view the history of meetings tied to a specific ID unless you are an administrator of the Zoom account. In that case, the meeting host can check:

Meeting Reports
: If you're the host or admin, Zoom provides detailed reports, such as meeting usage data (attendees, duration, etc.), that you can access through the Zoom web portal. However, if you're not the meeting host, you wonât have access to this data.

Conclusion:

The persistence of these Zoom meetings could be due to recurring meeting IDs, privacy settings that keep unauthorized participants out, and a lack of action by Zoom until a report is filed. Unfortunately, the public nature of the meeting ID itself doesnât guarantee Zoom will intervene unless it's flagged. If youâre concerned about specific meeting IDs, you can report them to Zoom directly to ensure they comply with Zoom's policies on adult content and privacy.
