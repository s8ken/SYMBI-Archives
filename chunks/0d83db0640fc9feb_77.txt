e permissions of your 
camera
, 
microphone
, and 
screen sharing
 access via 
Terminal
 on macOS, you can follow these steps:

1. 
Check Active Camera and Microphone Access

Unfortunately, there isnât a direct Terminal command that lists 
real-time
 camera or microphone access across all applications. However, you can check the system logs to see if any apps or processes are using your camera or microphone.

Using 
log
 to check for camera/mic activity:

To look for any activity related to camera or microphone access, you can use the 
log
 command in the Terminal to view system logs. Hereâs how:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --info

This command will show logs related to the camera. If an app or process is accessing the camera, it may appear here.

Similarly, for microphone activity:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "microphone"'

 --info

This will return logs related to microphone activity, such as when apps try to access it.

2. 
Revoke Camera and Microphone Access via Privacy Settings

While you can't directly change camera or microphone permissions from Terminal, you can manipulate privacy preferences via system files. For example, to 
disable camera access for specific apps
, you would need to manually edit or reset those permissions in 
System Preferences
.

Hereâs how to reset the 
camera
 access list for apps:

bash

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

This command will reset the camera permissions, which effectively means no apps will have access unless you manually enable them again from 
System Preferences
.

Similarly, you can reset the 
microphone
 access list by running:

bash

Copy

tccutil reset Microphone

This will reset the microphone permissions and prevent apps from accessing it until you explicitly allow it again through System Preferences.

3. 
Check Screen Recording Access via Terminal

You can check and reset 
screen recording permissions
 through the 
tccutil
 command, but itâs a bit trickier because this permission is stored under a different category. You can reset it by running:

bash

Copy

tccutil reset ScreenCapture

This will reset screen recording permissions, and youâll need to manually grant screen recording access again through 
System Preferences
.

4. 
List All App Permissions (Camera, Microphone, etc.)

To see all the apps that have access to camera, microphone, or screen capture, youâll need to navigate the systemâs 
TCC
 (Transparency, Consent, and Control) database. Unfortunately, this cannot be directly queried via Terminal without some additional tools or workarounds, but you can view the files at the following locations:

Camera permissions are stored in:

/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db

Microphone permissions are stored in:

/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db

Screen recording permissions are also managed in the same database.

You can inspect these files directly, but 
modifying
 them manually without a proper interface (like System Preferences) could cause issues and isn't recommended.

5. 
Monitor Connections (Network Usage)

You can monitor network activity (which could reveal if any unauthorized apps are sending data to the internet) using the 
netstat
 command or 
lsof
 to identify open connections.

View active connections using 
netstat
:

bash

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

This will show any established network connections, which could give you insight into suspicious activity related to apps accessing your camera, mic, or other resources remotely.

View open files and network activity with 
lsof
:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n

This will show you open files and network connections. If an application is secretly accessing your camera or microphone and sending data, it may show up in this list.
