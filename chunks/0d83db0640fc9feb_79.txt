ValueError: time data '' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

It seems there was an error in processing due to an empty line in the log data. I will fix that by ensuring only non-empty log entries are considered.

Let me adjust the approach to handle that.

python

Always show details

Copy

# Sample log data to filter (you should replace this with your actual log data)

log_data = 
"""2025-03-08 13:51:00 Some log message
2025-03-08 13:49:00 Another log message
2025-03-08 13:48:00 Another message
2025-03-08 13:45:00 Example log
"""

# Filter the log data for entries after the threshold time (only considering non-empty lines)

filtered_logs = [line 

for

 line 

in

 log_data.split(

'\n'

) 

if

 line.strip() 

and

 datetime.strptime(line[:

19

], 

'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

) >= threshold_time]

# Output the filtered logs

filtered_logs

Result

[]

It seems that no entries met the criteria for the last 10 minutes based on the sample log data provided.

To effectively filter logs, ensure that you replace the sample log data with your actual logs, and make sure that the logs' timestamps are in the same format as the one used in the filter. Let me know if you need any further help with this.

just give me the terminal command 

ChatGPT said:

To isolate log entries from the last 10 minutes in Terminal, you can use a command like this:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'timestamp > $((date +%s) - 600)'

 --info

Explanation:

log show
: Displays system logs.

--predicate 'timestamp > $((date +%s) - 600)'
: Filters logs based on the timestamp, where 
600
 represents the last 10 minutes in seconds.

--info
: Includes info-level logs.

This command will show logs from the last 10 minutes. Adjust the 
600
 value if you want to change the time frame (e.g., for 5 minutes, use 
300
).

You said:

for this log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "camera"' --info

ChatGPT said:

To filter logs for events containing "camera" from the last 10 minutes, use this command:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'timestamp > $((date +%s) - 600) AND eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --info

Explanation:

--predicate 'timestamp > $((date +%s) - 600) AND eventMessage contains "camera"'
: Filters logs from the last 10 minutes where the event message contains the word "camera".

--info
: Specifies to include informational logs.

This will give you logs related to camera events from the last 10 minutes.

Apologies for the confusion. The command I provided had an issue with how the 
date
 command was used. Hereâs the corrected version of the command that should work for filtering logs from the last 10 minutes containing the word "camera":

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera" AND timestamp > "2025-03-08 05:00:00"'

 --info

Unfortunately, macOS logs require a specific timestamp format and cannot dynamically calculate the last 10 minutes directly in a single command like I initially suggested. However, you can manually get the current timestamp from your system using:

bash

Copy

date

Then adjust the command accordingly using that timestamp, or you can use a smaller, manual range in place of 
2025-03-08 05:00:00
.

Let me know if you'd like me to help you further with this!
