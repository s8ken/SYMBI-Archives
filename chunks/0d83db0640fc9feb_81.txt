The error you're encountering seems to be due to incorrect formatting of the timestamp or eventMessage predicate in your 
log show
 command.

Let's resolve this step by step:

Correcting the Date Format

Instead of using 
timestamp >=
, which can be tricky with the format, let's use a simpler approach:

The 
log show
 tool expects a specific format for the timestamp, which is 
yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ss
. In your case, it seems like you're trying to use a relative timestamp, which might be causing some issues.

You can use the exact timestamp 
2025-03-08 13:53:54
 (which was generated by the 
date
 command) in the query.

New Command:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera" AND timestamp >= "2025-03-08 13:53:54"'

 --info

This should work by directly using the timestamp generated by the 
date
 command.

If you want to limit the output to just the last 10 minutes:

This should directly give you all logs related to the camera for the past 10 minutes:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera" AND timestamp >= "2025-03-08 13:53:54"'

 --info

Let me know if this works or if any other errors arise!
