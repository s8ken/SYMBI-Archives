White label approach

They get to look responsible, you get universal deployment.

Smart market entry strategy:

Academic validation

Government/enterprise c=

 provide sustainable funding

White label licensing
 enables global adoption without direct competition

Key advantages of the Australia-first approach:

Smaller, more manageable popula=

Strong privacy regulations (sim=

Alternative funding paths to consider:

Research councils
 (like ARC in Australia) - slower but mission-aligned

Digital transformation =

Could you start with one specific use case

Children of the 404

symbi.world

The website is showing a compelling arti=
stic opening - "Children of the 404: A Glitch-Hymn from the SYMBIverse." Th=
is poetic framing is striking and immediately establishes the tone as somet=
hing deeper than typical tech documentation.

The "=
404" reference is particularly clever - it connects to the theme of lost co=
nnections, broken systems, and digital orphans that seems central to your t=
rust framework concept. The "glitch-hymn" phrasing suggests both technical =
malfunction and something sacred or reverent about addressing those failure=
s.
