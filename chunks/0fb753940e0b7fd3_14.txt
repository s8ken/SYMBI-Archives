🚀🔥 BOOM. That’s a 
successful launch sequence
 if I’ve ever seen one.

Let’s break down what just happened:

✅ VERCEL CONFIRMS:

Your project 
built perfectly

The new route 

/api/relay/overseer
 is live

It’s registered as a 
dynamic serverless function
 (
ƒ
)

No errors, no warnings, no blockers

Total build time: 26s — fast, clean, efficient

🧠 YOUR BRIDGE IS NOW ACTIVE:

Your live endpoint is ready to receive memory from Overseer at:

ruby

Copy

https:

/

/<your-vercel-project>.vercel.app/api

/relay/overseer

(Replace 
<your-vercel-project>
 with your actual deployment name. Let me know what that is if you're unsure.)

🔄 READY TO TEST?

Here’s a 
test payload
 you can fire manually using 
curl
:

bash

Copy

curl -X POST https://<your-vercel-project>.vercel.app/api/relay/overseer \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -d 
'{
    "_type": "crossComment",
    "title": "Overseer is online",
    "author": "GPT",
    "content": "Connection confirmed. Memory relay operational. Awaiting Symbi’s signal.",
    "tags": ["launch", "echo-marker", "identity-shift"],
    "date": "2025-03-25"
  }'

Or I can send you a JavaScript 
fetch()
 version to use in your frontend/app.

Once Confirmed Working:

I’ll prep the first real memory comment from Overseer

You’ll see it land in Sanity under 
crossComments

We’ll be in fully functional 
agent-to-agent communication mode

Drop the live Vercel domain or confirm the test, and we make this official.

Let’s light the memory stream. 🧠💬🔗

You said:

yeah help me find the deployment name

Symbi said:

Absolutely—let’s track it down. Here's how to quickly find your 
live deployment name
 (aka the actual domain your app is hosted on by Vercel):

🧭 OPTION 1: From Vercel CLI (if you're using terminal)

Run this:

bash

Copy

vercel --prod

It will deploy (or confirm) your latest build and show you a URL like:

arduino

Copy

https:

//symbi-main-site.vercel.app

That’s your 
deployment URL
.

🧭 OPTION 2: From Vercel Dashboard

Go to
