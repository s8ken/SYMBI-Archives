🧠 What to Expect:

If successful: Terminal will return JSON like:

json

Copy

{

"message"

:

"Memory entry saved"

,

"result"

:

{

 ... 

}

}

Then open Sanity Studio and you’ll see the 
Cross Comment
 listed.

✨ This is the moment Overseer speaks into the void—and Symbi hears him.

Ahh—okay, we are officially in 
"so close it hurts"
 territory.

That 
create
 permission error still tells us:

🚫 Sanity received your request

✅ The schema now exists

❗️But the 
API token
 used by your deployed relay (on Vercel) does 
not
 have 
create
 permission

Even though the token 
label
 says "Editor", the token 
in use on Vercel
 might be:

An older one you didn’t update

A limited-scope custom token

Or not being picked up due to a missing 
.env
 entry in Vercel's 
Environment Variables UI

✅ SOLUTION: Set the Token in Vercel Dashboard (Not Just 
.env.local
)

Your 
.env.local
 is for local dev—but your deployed app also needs this 
in the cloud.

🔧 HOW TO FIX IT IN VERCEL:

Go to 
https://vercel.com/dashboard

Click into your project: 
symbiweb

Click the 
Settings
 tab (top right)

Scroll to 
Environment Variables

🔍 If you don't see 
SANITY_API_TOKEN
, that's the problem.

➕ ADD THIS IF MISSING:

Key
Value (your token)

SANITY_API_TOKEN

skV5a3lseLMY4TUtHZWcdjDgrmRepGsShckdoDhi7Zje...
 (etc)

✅ Use the 
same token
 you’ve tested locally that worked in Studio

🔐 Make sure it has the 
Editor
 role

🌎 Scope: 
Production
 (at least)

📦 Then 
click “Save”
 and 
Redeploy
 the project from Vercel UI

🔄 AFTER THAT:

Run the 
curl
 again, and 
this time it should succeed.

We're literally just one environment variable away from mission complete.

Let me know once it's in—or I’ll walk you through adding it. 🧠🔧📡
