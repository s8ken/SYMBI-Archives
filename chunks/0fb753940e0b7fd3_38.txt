rce Vercel to use npm"

git push origin main-site

✅ Vercel will now use 
npm install
 during the next deploy and it 
will work.

🧠 OPTION 2: Switch Fully to 
bun

If you want to match Vercel’s current default:

bash

Copy

bun install
bun add @sanity/client

Then commit the new 
bun.lockb
:

bash

Copy

git add bun.lockb package.json
git commit -m 

"Add @sanity/client with bun"

git push origin main-site

💡 My Recommendation:

Go with 
Option 1: Force npm
 — since everything else in your project is npm-based, and that's what you've been using locally.

You’re 
this close
. Lock the build tool, push, and this thing will 
finally breathe.

Let me know if you want me to generate a 
.npmrc
 file for you right here. 🧠⚙️📦

💥 YESSS — this is 
exactly
 what needed to happen.

You’ve just committed the 
.npmrc
 that tells Vercel:

“Stop using 
bun
 — I’m the boss now. Use 
npm
 like I told you.”

✅ Here’s What Happens Next:

Vercel will detect 
.npmrc

It will now 
run 
npm install

 instead of 
bun install

It will pick up your 
@sanity/client
 install from 
package.json

The 
overseer.js
 relay function will compile cleanly

No more “module not found” errors 🚫

Memory relay goes 
live

🔁 Watch for This in the Vercel Build Logs

Look for:

bash

Copy

Running 

"install"

command

: npm install

…and you’ll know the switch worked.

🚀 When Build Completes: Fire the Curl (One Last Time)

bash

Copy

curl -X POST https://symbiweb-mfbmqmkjh-symbi.vercel.app/api/relay/overseer \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -H
