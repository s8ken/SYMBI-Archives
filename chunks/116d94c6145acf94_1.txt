on3
 resulted in an 
exec format error
. This typically occurs when the shell tries to =
execute a file that is not a valid executable for the system.

Cause:

The file 
Python3
 in the specified path is likely not the=
 actual Python executable. On macOS, the Python framework installed by Xcod=
e Command Line Tools places the executable in a different location, often a=
 symbolic link or a different binary name.

You might be trying to run the framework=
 itself or a non-executable component.

Solution:

Use the =
correct Python executable
: Instead of directly referencing the fra=
mework path, use the 
py=
thon3
 command, which should be available in your PATH if the Command=
 Line Tools are installed correctly. Run:

Bash

Copy

python3

 --version

This should conf=
irm if Python 3.9 is installed and accessible.

Check th=
e installation
: Ensure the Xcode Command Line Tools are properly i=
nstalled. Run:

Bash

Copy

xco=
de-select

 --install

If already installed, verify the Python pa=
th:

Bash

Copy

which

 python3

It should point to something like 
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3=

 or 
/usr/bin/pyt=
hon3
.

Alternat=
ive
: If you need a specific Python version, consider using a versi=
on manager like 
pyenv
 to install and manage Python versions:

Bash

Copy

brew

 install

 pyenv

pyenv
=

 install

 3.9.0

pyenv
=

 global

 3.9.0

Fix the =
command
: If you must use the framework path, the actual executable=
 is likely at:

Bash

Copy

=

/Library/Dev=
eloper/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.9/b=
in/python3

Try running that instead=
.

npm I=
nstall Error: 
EACCES: p=
ermission denied

The =
command 
npm install -g =
npm@11.5.2
 failed with an 
EACCES
 (permission denied) error when trying to update npm=
 globally.

Cause:

The error occurs because the user (
standard
) lacks write=
 permissions to 
/usr/lo=
cal/lib/node_modules
, where global npm packages are installed. This =
is common on macOS when Node.js was installed without proper permissions or=
 with a different user (e.g., via 
sudo
).

macOS=E2=80=99s default permissions for =

/usr/local
 often=
 require elevated privileges for global installations.

Solutions:

Here=
 are several ways to resolve this, ordered from least to most invasive:

Option 1: 
Use 
sudo
 to Run the C=
ommand

Run =
the command with elevated privileges:

Bash

Copy

sudo

 npm

 install

 -g

 npm@11.5.2

=

Caution
: Using 
sudo
 can lead to permission issues later if other tools or scripts run as a=
 non-root user. Only use this if you=E2=80=99re comfortable managing permis=
sions manually.

Option 2: 
Fix P=
ermissions for Node.js

Adju=
st the permissions of the Node.js global directory to allow your user to wr=
ite to it:

Bash

Copy

sudo

 chown

 -R

 $(

whoami

)

:admin

 /usr/local/lib/node_modules

sudo

 chmod

 -R

 u+=
w

 /usr/local/lib/node_modu=
les

Then=
 retry:

Bash

Copy

npm

 install

 -g

 npm@11.5.2=

Option 3: 
Use a=
 Node Version Manager (Recommended)

To a=
void permission issues entirely, use a Node version manager like 
nvm
 (Node Version Manager)=
. This installs Node.js and npm in your home directory, avoiding system-lev=
el permission issues.

Install 
nvm
:

Bash

Copy

curl

 -o-
=

 https://raw.githubusercontent.co=
m/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh

 |

 bash

=

Close and reopen your terminal, or sourc=
e the shell configuration:

Bash

Copy

source

 ~/.zshrc

Install Node.js (which includes npm):

Bash

Copy

nvm

 install

 22

nvm

 use

 22

Update npm globally without 
sudo
:

Bash

Copy

npm

 install

 -g

 npm@11.5.2

Benefits=

: 
nvm
 a=
voids permission issues and allows you to switch between Node versions easi=
ly.

Option 4: 
Insta=
ll npm in a User Directory

Conf=
igure npm to install global packages in a directory you own:

Bash

Copy

mkdir

 ~/.npm-global

npm

 config

 set

 =
prefix
