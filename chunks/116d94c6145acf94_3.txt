sion issues with the Homebrew directories, and subsequent 
pyenv
 commands failed because 
pyenv
 isn=E2=80=99t=
 installed yet. Let=E2=80=99s resolve these issues step-by-step.

1. 
Resol=
ve Homebrew Permission Issues

The =
error indicates that multiple directories under 
/opt/homebrew
 (the default Homebrew install=
ation path on Apple Silicon Macs) are not writable by your user (
standard
). This is causing=
 the 
brew install pyenv=

 command to fail.

Solution: Fix Homebrew Permissions

Run =
the following commands to correct the ownership and permissions of the Home=
brew directories:

Bash

Copy

sudo

 chown

 -R

 standard:ad=
min

 /opt/homebrew

sudo

 chmod

 -R

 u+=
w

 /opt/homebrew

Thes=
e commands:

Change the ownership of all Homebrew dir=
ectories to your user (
=
standard
) and the 
admin
 group.

Ensure your user has write permissions t=
o these directories.

Verify Homebrew

Afte=
r fixing permissions, check if Homebrew is working:

Bash

Copy

brew

 doctor

This=
 will report any remaining issues with your Homebrew setup. If it complains=
 about other permissions or configurations, address them as suggested.

2. 
Insta=
ll 
pyenv

Once=
 permissions are fixed, install 
pyenv
:

Bash

Copy

brew

 install

 pyenv

This=
 should now succeed. Verify the installation:

Bash

Copy

pyenv

 --version

=

You =
should see output like 
=
pyenv 2.x.x
.

3. 
Set U=
p 
pyenv

=

To u=
se 
pyenv
, you ne=
ed to configure your shell to recognize it. Since you=E2=80=99re using 
zsh
 (the default she=
ll on macOS), add the following lines to your 
~/.zshrc
 file:

Bash

Copy

export

 PATH

=3D

"

$HOME

/.pyenv/bin:

$PATH

"

eval

 "$(

pyenv

 i=
nit 

--path

)"

eval

 "$(

pyenv

 i=
nit -)"

Appl=
y the changes:

Bash

Copy

source

 ~/.zshrc

Veri=
fy that 
pyenv
 is=
 correctly set up:

Bash

Copy

pyenv

 --version

=

4. 
Insta=
ll and Use Python 3.9.0

Now =
you can install Python 3.9.0:

Bash

Copy

pyenv

 install

 3.9.0

This=
 may take a few minutes as it downloads and compiles Python. Once installed=
, set it as the global Python version:

Bash

Copy

pyenv

 global

 3.9.0

Veri=
fy the Python version:

Bash

Copy

python3

 --version

It s=
hould show 
Python 3.9.0=

. If it still points to 
/usr/bin/python3
, ensure 
pyenv
 is correctly initialized by checking your PAT=
H:

Bash

Copy

echo

 $PATH

You =
should see something like 
/Users/standard/.pyenv/shims
 near the beginning of the PATH.

5. 
Confi=
rm Python Path

Sinc=
e you previously checked 
which python3
 and got 
/usr/bin/python3
, this indicates the system Python is being =
used. After setting up 
=
pyenv
, run:

Bash

Copy

which

 python3

It s=
hould now point to 
~/.p=
yenv/shims/python3
. If not, restart your terminal or run 
source ~/.zshrc
 again.

6. 
Optio=
nal: Address npm Issue from Previous Context

Your=
 earlier issue with 
npm=
 install -g npm@11.5.2
 also stemmed from permission problems. Since =
you=E2=80=99re encountering similar permission issues with Homebrew, it=E2=
=80=99s likely your system has restrictive permissions for development tool=
s. If you still need to update npm, consider using 
nvm
 (Node Version Manager) as recommende=
d previously to avoid permission issues:

Bash

Copy

curl

 -o-

 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh

 |

 bash

source

 ~/.zshrc

nvm

 install

 22

npm

 install

 -g

 n=
pm@11.5.2

7. 
Addit=
ional Notes

Xcode Co=
mmand Line Tools
: Since 
xcode-select --install
 confirmed the tools are installed, =
you=E2=80=99re good here. If you need to update them, use:

Bash

Copy

softwareupdate

 --all

 --install

 --force

Homebrew=
 Maintenance
: After fixing permissions, keep Homebrew updated:

=
Bash

=

Copy

brew

 update

brew

 upgrade
