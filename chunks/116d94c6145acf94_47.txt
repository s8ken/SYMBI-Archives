Summer Research Fellow Mayleen Cortez-Ro=
driguez is developing a revenue prediction tool for nonprofits using the Na=
tional Center for Charity Statistics (NCCS) dataset, covering over 1 millio=
n nonprofits across 33 years.

The tool uses Gaussian Processes and opt=
imization techniques (e.g., Bayesian Optimization) to predict nonprofit rev=
enue while handling outliers (e.g., anomalies caused by events like COVID-1=
9).

The project reduced computation time fro=

able spike in 2020=E2=80=932021.
