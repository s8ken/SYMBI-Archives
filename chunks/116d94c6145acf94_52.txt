s. Based on xAI's documentation and user reports, Grok's conversation histo=
ry is tied directly to your registered account. If the email change creates=
 a mismatch (e.g., your old history is linked to the previous Google ID), i=
t might appear as if everything except the current session is inaccessible,=
 since unregistered or mismatched sessions don't retain data across interac=
tions.

Why This Might Be Happening

Account =
Linking
: When you sign in with Google, Grok uses your Google profi=
le (including email and ID) to associate chats with your xAI account. A cha=
nge in your primary Google email could log you in under a "new" profile fro=
m Grok's perspective, leaving old history behind. This is a common pain poi=
nt for third-party sign-ins, as noted in user forums.
