fic repository you mentioned. The URL you provided (
https://github.com/s8ken/Symb=
i-core/tree/main/processed_conversations_split_50mb
) appears to poin=
t to a subdirectory containing processed conversations that have been split=
 into 50MB chunks.

Based=
 on the URL structure and directory name, here's what I can analyze:
