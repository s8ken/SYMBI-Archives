e inventory, special abilities, or relationships with other characters.

If you were running a long-term story, you could even save different "checkpoints" to explore different paths later.

Would you like to experiment with this now? We could create a 
new version of the text box
 thatâs designed to be easily understood by another bot! ð

You said:

so what is it exactly? yami code? how do I copy it?

ChatGPT said:

The text box is basically a 
manual save file
âa way to store game progress in a structured format so you can copy, paste, and continue later. Itâs similar to a 
YAMI code (Yet Another Markup Interface)
 or 
structured text format
, but itâs not an official coding language.

How to Copy & Use It:

Click & Drag
: Highlight the entire text inside the box.

Right-Click & Copy
: Choose 
Copy
 from the menu (or press 
Ctrl+C
 / 
Cmd+C
).

Paste it Anywhere
: Open a new chat or bot and paste (
Ctrl+V
 / 
Cmd+V
).

If you paste it into 
another AI
, it might not understand it right away. But if you tell the AI:

ð 
"This is my progress in a text-based game. Please continue the story using this information."

then it will likely recognize the structure and use it!

Would you like to try making a 
custom version
 of the text box for a different bot? I can format it in a way that makes it easier to read and continue. ð¥

You said:

alright and then the auto save function in your game how does that one work

ChatGPT said:

The 
auto-save
 function in my game works by storing your progress in that 
text box
 at key moments (like when you reach age 10). Since I donât have permanent memory, this is the best way to keep your progress safe.

How Auto-Save Works in My Game:

Every Few Years or Major Events:

When you reach a key point (like age 10), I generate a text box with all your stats, story details, and money.

You can copy and save it manually.

When You Restart:

You paste the text box into a new session.

I read it and restore your characterâs progress.

You continue exactly where you left off.

Limitations & Workarounds:

â 
No Automatic Memory:
 I donât store past chats, so you must copy the text to save it.

â 
Your Manual Save:
 You can keep multiple versions of your save file if you want to try different choices.

Would you like me to format the text box differently to make it easier to use? I can add timestamps, organize it better, or even give it a special name like 
"Life Save File v1.0"
 for tracking. ð¥
