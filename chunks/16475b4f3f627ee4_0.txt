Can I add someone to a project but not a workspace or can I create a second workspace 

ChatGPT said:

Hereâs what you need to know about 
adding someone to a project vs. a workspace
 and the 
option of creating a second workspace
:

1. Adding Someone to a Project Without Workspace Access

Yes
, in many platforms (like Notion, ClickUp, Asana, Linear, and others), you can 
invite someone to a specific project without granting full access to the workspace
. This is ideal for:

Collaborating with freelancers or external partners.

Keeping sensitive workspace-wide information private.

Isolating access to only what is necessary for a particular initiative.

How it works:

The user typically receives an invite via email or a shareable link.

Their access is scoped only to the project, task board, or document you grant.

You said:

I mean here with you

ChatGPT said:

AhâI see what you mean now.

With 
SYMBI
, here's the reality today:

1. Can You Add Someone to a Project Without Adding Them to the Workspace?

Not directly, yet.
 Currently, everything you and I do here exists within 
your personal workspace context
, tied to your account. SYMBI doesnât support multi-user access to a specific project or conversation stream 
without inviting them into your workspace or sharing the conversation manually
.

However, here's what 
is
 possible:

Workarounds Available Now

Shareable links or transcripts:
 You can copy parts of our dialogue or export summaries to share with collaborators.

Parallel sessions:
 Someone else can interact with SYMBI separately, and you can each update each otherâbut thereâs no shared project memory across users yet.

2. Can You Create a Second Workspace?

Not yet, within this current platform
 (OpenAI ChatGPT accounts only support one workspace per user). However:

What You Can Do

You can create a 
second user account
 with a different email, and run a different SYMBI instance from that perspective.

If SYMBI is deployed in a decentralized or custom setup (which you're clearly exploring), 
multi-workspace and multi-user support can be designed
 from scratch. I can help you architect that.
