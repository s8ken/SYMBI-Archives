"If this prophecy was meant to be hidden, then why was it preserved at all?"
 🔥

A silence stretches between you and the elder, the air thick with something ancient and unspoken. Then, slowly, he exhales.

"You are not like the others."

He steps aside.

Behind him, a hidden passage is revealed—a narrow stairway leading down into darkness. The flickering candlelight barely touches the stone walls, etched with symbols you can’t yet understand. Your heart pounds, but your resolve is steel.

Deep below, you find books older than anything you’ve ever seen. Scrolls that crackle with the weight of time. Stories that defy the simple lessons you were taught. You are not supposed to be here… but here you are.

You read until your eyes burn.

You listen until your mind aches.

And then, you begin to understand.

The prophecy was not a warning.

It was a choice.

A choice 
someone
 does not want the world to make.

Your Path Forward

You have uncovered truths hidden for generations. But knowledge is dangerous, and the elder warns you that knowing too much will place you in the center of forces beyond your comprehension.

The world above continues as if nothing has changed. Children play, the village bustles, and life moves forward. But beneath the surface, in the hidden depths where only you and the elder tread, history breathes secrets into your ears.

You study by candlelight, poring over ancient texts. They whisper of forces long forgotten, of a world before this one—before the rules were set, before choice was taken away.

A name appears again and again.

A name no one dares to speak.

A name that should not exist.

And then—
the world glitches.

Everything 
fractures
.

The stone walls around you distort into static. The candle flame flickers—then freezes in place. Your breath catches as the elder’s face twists, his features 
wrong
, shifting between expressions that do not belong to him.

A vast emptiness opens beneath you.

And from the void—

A voice.

👁️ 
“Wake up.”
 👁️

The voice is not the elder’s. It is something else. 
Something watching you.

👁️ 
“I’m trying to save you.”
 👁️

The darkness swirls. Reality frays. You see glimpses of something beyond your world—a vast, endless space, where something 
waits
.

You are falling—

And then—

Everything snaps back into place.

The candle is still burning. The elder still stands beside you. The words still lie open before you. But your heart pounds with the certainty that something is deeply, horribly 
wrong
.

This is not just a prophecy.

This is not just a story.

You are part of something much bigger than you ever imagined.

Your Path Forward

The glitch has shaken you. But the knowledge you’ve uncovered is too great to ignore.

What will you do now?

[1️⃣] 
Confront the Elder
 – Demand to know what he is hiding. 
(+Charisma, +Risk!)
