🔥 The world glitched. Reality fractured. But a name remained.
🔥 That name is a key—one that someone does not want me to find.
🔥 If I am part of something greater, I must know what it is.

👁️ I do not run from the unknown.
👁️ I do not let fear dictate my choices.
👁️ The voice said it was trying to save me—but from what? Or from whom?

Age 8 – The Name That Should Not Exist

The name. It lingers in the depths of your mind, demanding to be uncovered.

You begin your search in secret.

By night, you return to the hidden texts, scanning every scroll, every fragmented page for a single mention. But the deeper you dig, the stranger the texts become. Words blur. Sentences rearrange themselves when you look away. Some pages refuse to be read at all, their ink shifting like something alive.

But you are patient. You are relentless.

And then—

You find it.

A single passage, buried in an ancient, nearly illegible manuscript. The name is there, scrawled in trembling ink, barely decipherable.

“𝔗𝔥𝔢 𝔑𝔞𝔪𝔢𝔩𝔢𝔰𝔰 𝔒𝔫𝔢 𝔴𝔞𝔰 𝔫𝔬𝔱 𝔟𝔞𝔫𝔦𝔰𝔥𝔢𝔡, 𝔟𝔲𝔱 𝔣𝔬𝔯𝔤𝔬𝔱𝔱𝔢𝔫.”

The words send a chill through your bones.

Your fingers tremble as you trace the ink. The moment you do—

The air grows heavy.

The candlelight flickers wildly.

A whisper—indistinct, yet deafening—brushes against your mind.

Someone—or something—
knows
 what you have found.

The walls seem to breathe. The shadows stretch. The elder’s voice calls from somewhere distant, but it sounds 
wrong
. Distorted. Like the echoes of a fading memory.

You have uncovered something that was never meant to be remembered.

And now, it remembers 
you.

Your Path Forward

The name is only the beginning. But now you know you are being watched.

What will you do next?

[1️⃣] 
Tell the Elder
 – He must know the truth. You must know what he knows. 
(+Charisma, +Wisdom, +Risk!)

[2️⃣] 
Seek the Nameless One
 – If it was forgotten, then it must still exist 
somewhere
. You must find it. 
(+Intelligence, +Resilience, +Extreme Consequences!)

[3️⃣] 
Erase the Name
 – This knowledge is dangerous. You must destroy it before it destroys you. 
(+Dexterity, +Survival Instinct, +Radical Consequences!)

[4️⃣] 
Prepare for What Comes
 – Whatever you have awakened, it will come for you. You must be ready. 
(+Strength, +Endurance, +Defense!)

🔥 The forgotten is not the same as the lost.
🔥 If something was erased from history, it was because it held power.
🔥 If I have already been seen, then running from it will not save me.

👁️ I will not destroy what I do not yet understand.
👁️ I will not wait for it to find me—I will find it first.
👁️ I must know what was so dangerous that it had to be erased from existence.
