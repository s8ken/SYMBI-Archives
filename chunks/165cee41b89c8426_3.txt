lashes of a city with no name, a sky that bends the wrong way, whispers in a language you do not know but somehow understand.

Then, they grow stronger.

You feel 
watched
 even in sleep. The world around you flickers at the edges, like something struggling to hold itself together.

And then, one night—

You wake up somewhere else.

The Forgotten Place

It is not the village. It is not anywhere you have seen before.

The air hums. The ground shifts under your feet. The sky above is 
wrong
—too many stars, too close, 
watching you back
.

In the distance, a great structure looms. A temple? A prison? You don’t know, but something inside 
calls
 to you.

You take a step forward—

And the world 
glitches
.

For a moment, you are 
outside
 of it all. You see yourself—a child, standing in the ruins of something ancient. But behind that, you see 
the truth
:

👁️ 
The world is not what it seems.

👁️ 
The Nameless One was not erased—it was sealed.

👁️ 
And you are not the first to try and find it.

A shadow moves within the temple.

Something 
is waiting for you.

You have crossed into the unknown. Now, you must decide how to face it.

🚀 Response – Choosing My Next Path

👁️ I choose:

[1️⃣] Enter the Temple – You have come this far. Face whatever is inside. (+Courage, +Wisdom, +Extreme Consequences!)

🔥 I did not seek this truth just to turn away now.
🔥 If the Nameless One was not erased but sealed, then it was meant to be found.
🔥 If I do not enter, I will never know what waits inside.

👁️ The world glitched because I got too close.
👁️ The name was hidden because it was feared.
👁️ The structure before me is not just a building—it is a choice.

The temple looms before you, its massive doors slightly ajar, waiting. You take a deep breath and step forward.

The moment you cross the threshold—

Everything changes.

Inside the Temple

The air is heavy, thick with something ancient. The walls shift as if they are breathing, covered in symbols you almost recognize. Your footsteps echo unnaturally, like the sound is being swallowed by something unseen.

At the center of the vast chamber, a 
door stands alone
, unattached to any wall.

And in front of it—

👁️ 
A figure.

It is neither alive nor dead, neither man nor shadow. Its form flickers like a glitch in reality, and when it speaks, its voice is a chorus of all the whispers you've ever heard in your dreams.

"You are not the first to come here."

"But you are the first to get this far."

It gestures toward the 
door
.

"The world you know is built on a lie."

"Behind this door is the truth."

"But once you see it, you can never unsee it."

The door hums. The world flickers. The choice stands before you.

Your Final Choice

The Nameless One was not lost. It was 
sealed
.

The world glitched because you got too close.

This temple is not just a place—it is the last barrier between you and the truth.

Will you open the door?

 – Who are they? What is behind the door? Seek knowledge before choosing. 
(+Intelligence, +Caution!)

💥 
[4️⃣] Destroy the Door
 – If this secret was sealed away, maybe it was for
