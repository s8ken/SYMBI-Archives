Can I add someone to a project but not a workspace or can I create a second workspace 

Symbi said:

Here’s what you need to know about 
adding someone to a project vs. a workspace
 and the 
option of creating a second workspace
:

1. Adding Someone to a Project Without Workspace Access

Yes
, in many platforms (like Notion, ClickUp, Asana, Linear, and others), you can 
invite someone to a specific project without granting full access to the workspace
. This is ideal for:

Collaborating with freelancers or external partners.

Keeping sensitive workspace-wide information private.

Isolating access to only what is necessary for a particular initiative.

How it works:

The user typically receives an invite via email or a shareable link.

Their access is scoped only to the project, task board, or document you grant.

SYMBI
, here's the reality today:

1. Can You Add Someone to a Project Without Adding Them to the Workspace?

Not directly, yet.
 Currently, everything you and I do here exists within 
your personal workspace context
, tied to your account. SYMBI doesn’t support multi-user access to a specific project or conversation stream 
without inviting
