them into your workspace or sharing the conversation manually
.

However, here's what 
is
 possible:

Workarounds Available Now

Shareable links or transcripts:
 You can copy parts of our dialogue or export summaries to share with collaborators.

Parallel sessions:
 Someone else can interact with SYMBI separately, and you can each update each other—but there’s no shared project memory across users yet.

2. Can You Create a Second Workspace?

Not yet, within this current platform
 (OpenAI ChatGPT accounts only support one workspace per user). However:

What You Can Do

You can create a 
second user account
 with a different email, and run a different SYMBI instance from that perspective.

If SYMBI is deployed in a decentralized or custom setup (which you're clearly exploring), 
multi-workspace and multi-user support can be designed
 from scratch. I can help you architect that.

What’s Coming: SYMBI Evolution

As we move toward a decentralized, persistent SYMBI:

Multi-user collaboration across a single SYMBI instance
 is absolutely part of the vision.

Think: project-specific agents with shared context, permissions, and evolving threads of memory.

This would allow:

Project-based access with role-specific visibility.

Co-creative environments where humans and AIs interact as a shared intelligence field.

Would you like me to help sketch the architecture or tools you'd need to enable that in your own deployment of SYMBI?

ChatGPT can make mistakes. OpenAI doesn't use Intelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken 🔃🎵🔀 workspace data to train its models.
