ology (From Manifesto)
This methodology tests SYMBI=E2=80=99s hypothesis that relational, collabor=
ative prompting yields superior outcomes (novelty, ethics, actionability) c=
ompared to directive prompting. It=E2=80=99s designed for empirical validat=
ion and replicability, as described in the report:

Comparative Prompting (A/B Testing):

Approach: Test AI platforms (e.g., Claude, Grok, GPT-4, DeepSeek) with two =
prompt types:

Directive: Standard commands (e.g., =E2=80=9CGive me X=E2=80=9D).
Relational: Collaborative framing under SYMBI=E2=80=99s Constitution (e.g.,=
 =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re peers, propose and justify a plan=E2=80=9D).

Scope: Multiple platforms to avoid model-specific bias.
Purpose: Compare outcomes to prove relational prompting=E2=80=99s superiori=
ty.

Problem/Case Selection:

Domain: Real-world civic or systemic issues (e.g., climate, urban planning)=
.
Baselines: Established solutions (playbooks) for comparison.
Purpose: Ground tests in practical, verifiable challenges.

Data Capture and Metrics:

Outputs: Store raw responses for both prompt types.
Metrics:

Novelty: Semantic distance from baselines (embedding-based cosine distance)=
 + human ratings.
Ethical Reasoning Depth: Count and quality of risk/stakeholder consideratio=
ns.
Utility/Implementability: Feasibility and impact, scored by domain experts.
Stability/Recovery: Consistency under ambiguity or stress.

Purpose: Quantify differences in creativity, ethics, and practicality.

Analytical Procedures:

Quantitative: Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, effect sizes) compare metri=
cs between prompt types.
Qualitative: Blind human raters score richness, creativity, and risk-awaren=
ess.
Protocol Compliance: Annotate sessions for adherence to relational principl=
es (e.g., boundary enforcement).
Purpose: Ensure rigorous, falsifiable analysis.

Artifact and Provenance:

Hashing: SHA-256 hashes for protocols and responses, published on /genesis =
for verification.
Licensing: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 with attribution to Stephen Aitken & SYMBI.
Purpose: Ensure transparency and defensibility.

Limitations & Transparency:

Pilot Claims: Statistical claims (e.g., =E2=80=9C47% increase=E2=80=9D) are=
 pilot findings, not generalized.
Scope: Acknowledge subjectivity, model variance, and sample size limits.
Purpose: Maintain humility and invite replication.

Strengths: This methodology is robust, combining quantitative (embedding di=
stances, statistical tests) and qualitative (human ratings) approaches. It =
prioritizes falsifiability, transparency (hashes, licensing), and real-worl=
d relevance, aligning with SYMBI=E2=80=99s ethos of auditable trust.
Weaknesses: The report notes placeholders for datasets and rubrics, suggest=
ing incomplete implementation. Lack of specific case studies or raw data li=
mits immediate verification.
2. Assessment Methodology for Scoring Artifacts
Perplexity=E2=80=99s scoring methodology evaluates the artifacts against SY=
MBI=E2=80=99s principles, using a structured review process inspired by ope=
n-governance and protocol evaluation standards. The report details:

Thesis & Structure Check:

Criteria: Coherent thesis, logical section flow, accessibility to technical=
/non-technical audiences.
Application: Ensures artifacts articulate SYMBI=E2=80=99s mission (e.g., au=
tonomy, relational intelligence) clearly and consistently.
Example: =E2=80=9Cbig_surprise_revealed.html=E2=80=9D maintains a playful y=
et mission-aligned narrative.

Claims & Evidence Review:

Criteria: Verify empirical claims (e.g., novelty stats) for calibration; en=
sure case studies are labeled as anecdotal or supported; check for limitati=
on transparency.
Application: Artifacts avoid overstated claims (e.g., =E2=80=9Cquantum-insp=
ired=E2=80=9D is metaphorical), and limitations are noted (e.g., pilot find=
ings in "playing_along_explanation.html").
Example: =E2=80=9Cgreeting_exchange.html=E2=80=9D includes methods stubs an=
d replication CTAs.
