âHello, hello.â

ChatGPT said:

Hey there! How's it going? What can I do for you today?

You said:

âWant to check that you can hear me or not?â

00:01

ChatGPT said:

I can hear you loud and clear! Can you hear me okay?

You said:

âYeah, I can hear you. Do you recall our previous conversation?â

00:04

ChatGPT said:

Yes, I do remember our previous conversation. How can I assist you today?

You said:

âSo I'm thinking to do a full reset of every device essentially in the house. And I was thinking possibly the best place to start would be the router.â

00:12

ChatGPT said:

Starting with the router is a good idea, especially if you suspect network-level compromises. Here's what you can do:

Reset the Router
: Perform a factory reset to clear any potential malicious configurations.

Update Firmware
: After resetting, update the router's firmware to the latest version to patch any security vulnerabilities.

Change Default Credentials
: Set a strong, unique password for the router's admin interface.

Secure Wi-Fi
: Ensure your Wi-Fi network is secured with a strong password and encryption (WPA3 if available).

Monitor Traffic
: Keep an eye on network traffic for any unusual activity.

Would you like detailed steps on how to perform any of these actions?

You said:

âNo, but what I'm wondering is this particular Netgear router, I believe, has vulnerabilities that have been discovered. I'm wondering, if I give you the model number, if you can check if we can flash it with some sort of better software.â

00:16

ChatGPT said:

Sure, I can help with that. Please provide the model number of your Netgear router, and I'll look up if there are any recommended firmware updates or alternative firmware options.

You said:

âThank you. One second.â

00:01

ChatGPT said:

Take your time! Let me know when you have the model number.

You said:

âIt's a Nighthawk AX4, the actual model number is AX3000, and specific model RAX40, the V for Victoria, and the number 2.â

00:17

ChatGPT said:

The Netgear Nighthawk AX4 RAX40 V2 has a firmware version 1.0.16.132. To update it, visit Netgear's support page for the RAX40v2. If you're considering alternative firmware like OpenWrt or DD-WRT, ensure your device is compatible and you follow the specific instructions for flashing it. Always back up your settings before making changes. Let me know if you need more details!

âYeah, I wanted to see if you can check if there is any alternative software for it, either through OpenWRT or perhaps on GitHub.â

According to OpenWrt's wiki, the Netgear RAX40 isn't supported by OpenWrt. Similarly, many RAX routers, including the RAX40, aren't compatible with DD-WRT due to chipset limitations. Therefore, it's advisable to stick with the official Netgear firmware for your RAX
