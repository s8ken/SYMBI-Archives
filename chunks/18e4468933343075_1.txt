âYes, in addition to the Netgear, I actually also have a TP-Link AC1200 mesh Wi-Fi router system. And what I'm wondering is, is one superior to the other? Or is there a perhaps a way we can utilize both devices to create an even stronger network?â

Both routers have their strengths. Hereâs a quick comparison:

Netgear Nighthawk AX4 RAX40 V2
: This router supports Wi-Fi 6, offering faster speeds and better performance with compatible devices.

TP-Link AC1200 Mesh WiFi System
: This system is designed for broader coverage and can be expanded with additional mesh units. Itâs ideal for covering larger areas with consistent signal strength.

Using Both Together
:

Router + Mesh
: You can use the Netgear as the main router and integrate the TP-Link mesh system to extend coverage in areas with weak signals.

Access Point Mode
: If the Netgear router allows, you can set it up as an access point connected to the TP-Link mesh for better performance in specific areas.

Would you like guidance on setting them up together?

âSo I live in a one-bedroom apartment, so coverage is not the issue. What I'm really looking for is the most superior strength in terms of avoiding vulnerability.â

âSo the main computer I use is the MacBook, which is the one we discovered the vulnerabilities on yesterday. I also have an iPhone and an iPad Pro, and these are my primary devices. But then I also have three or four Android devices, which I've bought as backups because my devices have been compromised. The Android devices as well have been compromised, so we will need to factory reset them. But for example, when I set up the home Wi-Fi router, that involves installing a Netgear app on a mobile device. So what I was thinking potentially is to install it all on one Android device that we keep off the network rather than installing it, say, on my iPhone, which is always connected to a network, and potentially try and minimize the attempt, like the way it's being h
