Got it! Using a backup Android device that stays off the network for setting up the Netgear app is a smart approach to minimize risks. Hereâs a suggested plan:

Factory Reset Android Devices
: Start by factory resetting all Android devices to ensure they are clean.

Install Netgear App
: Install the Netgear app on the Android device that you will keep off the network. This way, the device won't be directly exposed to your main network.

Set Up Router
: Use this isolated device to configure and set up your Netgear router securely.

Keep Device Isolated
: After setup, keep the Android device off the network and only use it for specific tasks that require the app.

Let me know if you need any more details or assistance!
