Also mirror these into 
Vercel project environment variables
 (so deploys don=E2=80=99t break).

5. QStash Scheduler

Schedule the 
/api/report
 endpoint daily:

bash

Copy code

curl -X POST https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/http=
s://sky.vercel.app/api/report \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer 
$QSTASH_TOKEN

" \
  -H 

"Upstash-Cron: 0 9 * * *"

6. Verify

Push changes:

bash

Copy code

git add .
git commit -m 

"Add Symbi Core v1 (=
logs, reports, context bridge)"

git push origin main

Deploy on Vercel.

Check Supabase 
symbi_logs
 =E2=86=92 you should see a fresh=

daily report
 each d=
ay.

Test Overseer =E2=86=94 Symbi brid=
ge via 
/api/context
.

=E2=9C=85 Outcome

Your repo 
s8ken/sky
 now becomes 
Symbi=E2=80=99s operational base
:

Persistent logs (
symbi_logs
)

Overseer <-> Symbi messaging=
 (
symbi_context_nodes
)

Daily autonomous reporting (QStash=
)

Vercel-hosted, production-ready

Do you want me to 
prep the full PR-ready code for 
s8ken/sky

 (so you just pull & merge), or walk you thr=
ough slotting the API routes into your existing repo structure manually?

You said:

codex can look at this no?

Symbi sa=
id:

Yes =F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F=
 =E2=80=94 Codex (the GitHub Copilot-style AI coder) can absolutely look at=
 your repo and help wire this in.

Here=E2=80=99s how we can use it eff=
ectively for 
s8ken/sky
:

=F0=9F=94=A7 How Codex Can Help Wit=
h 
s8ken/sky

Repo Scan & Context Awareness

Open 
s8ken/sky
 in VS Code (or whatever IDE you=E2=80=99re usin=
g).

Enable Copilot / Codex.

Paste in the 
plan
 we outlined (logs table, context bridge,=
 report API).

Codex will adapt the code to your re=
po=E2=80=99s structure (whether it=E2=80=99s 
/app/api
 or 
/p=
ages/api
).

Generate Boilerplate Routes

Prompt Codex:

=E2=80=9CCreate a Next.js API route =
at 
/app/api/log/route.ts
 t=
hat inserts into Supabase 
symbi_l=
ogs
 with category + content fields.=E2=80=9D

Do the same for 
/report
 and 
/context
.

Env Variable Setup

Tell Codex:

=E2=80=9CAdd Supabase client initial=
ization that uses 
SUPABASE_URL
 and 
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KE=
Y
 from environment variables.=E2=80=9D

It=E2=80=99ll stub the correct clien=
t wrapper.

Supabase SQL Migration

Paste the schema:

sql

Copy code

create

 =

table

 symbi_l=
ogs (...);

create

table

 symbi_context=
_nodes (...);

Ask Codex to generate a migration =
file if your repo already uses Prisma or Drizzle ORM.

Cron Scheduling (QStash)

Codex can also generate the 
curl
 command or a Node script =
to register your 
/api/report
 job with QStash.

Example prompt:

=E2=80=9CWrite a script using @ups=
tash/qstash to schedule a POST request to 
/api/report
 every day at 9 UTC.=E2=80=9D

Pull Request Assembly

Once routes + migrations are worki=
ng locally, push to 
s8ken/sky
 as a new branch (
symbi-co=
re-v1
).

Codex can draft the PR description=
 summarizing what=E2=80=99s added:

Supabase integration

Logging endpoints

Daily report automation

Shared context bridge

=E2=9A=A1 
Your Advantage
: Codex is great for filling i=
n the boilerplate and making sure it fits your repo conventions (imports, d=
irectory structure, TypeScript typing).

I=E2=80=99ll handle 
the archi=
tecture + enforcement logic
, and Codex will do the heavy lifting o=
f code stitching.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to draft the 
exact prompts
 you should give Codex to dro=
p Symbi Core v1 into 
s8ken/sky
 seamlessly? That way you don=E2=80=99t fight with guesswork =E2=80=
=94 you just copy prompts, Codex does the coding.

You said:

yeah I think we should

Symbi said:

Perfect. Let=E2=80=99s arm you with 
battle-tested prompts for Codex
 so it s=
titches Symbi Core v1 into 
s8ken/s=
ky
 without friction.

Below are 
ready-to-use Codex prompts
. Each one is atomic =
=E2=80=94 paste into your editor while focused on the right file or folder,=
 and Codex will generate the implementation.
