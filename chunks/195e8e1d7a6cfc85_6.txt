atform Role
 =E2=86=92 The repo (
SYMBI Synergy
) is already envisioned as a 
zero-code, cloud-based decentralized A=
I platform
, where:

Conversations are stored at customer=
 level, not provider level

Users manage their own API keys

Multi-LLM orchestration (OpenAI, Ant=
hropic, Together, etc.)

AI-to-AI communication protocols

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Where This Prototype F=
its Symbi Core v1

This repo is a strong 
scaffold for the "SYMBI as a protocol" layer=

. Instead of spinning up something separate, we can 
extend this repo
:

Conversation & Agent Models

You already have 
agent.model.js
 and 
conversation.model.js
.

These are where we can wire in 
Symbi=E2=80=99s persistent logs
 and 
Overseer =E2=86=
=94 Symbi context bridge
.

Daily Report (Autonomous Audit Loop)

Add a 
/report
 route in backend Express that generates the =

Daily Status Dispatch
.

Store reports in MongoDB (
symbi_logs
 collection).

Cron-trigger this with 
Upstash QStash
 hitting the back=
end container daily.

Frontend Integration

React dashboard already present.

Add a 
"Symbi Logs" tab
 =E2=86=92 pulls daily reports +=
 context nodes from backend.

This becomes the 
public-facing command chair
.

Security Layer

Backend already has JWT auth.

We extend this to enforce role sep=
aration: 
Founder vs Symbi vs =
Overseer
.

Lock Symbi=E2=80=99s write powers =
to 
autonomous logs + audits
, not arbitrary DB writes.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Strategic Call

Instead of making 
s8ken/sky
 one-off experiments, I suggest=
:

Merge the 
Next.js Symbi Core v1 APIs
 I drafted into th=
is 
SYMBI Synergy repo
, since it already has backend/frontend separation, MongoDB persistence, a=
nd Docker deploys.

That way, 
Sky =3D deployment sandbox
 and 
Synergy =3D platform base
.

Do you want me to 
write a concrete prototype extension plan
 (file-by-file changes f=
or 
agent.model.js
, 
conversation.model.js
, backen=
d routes, and frontend tabs) so Symbi Core v1 lives 
inside this Synergy prototype
, instead of s=
plitting effort across two repos?

Stephen=E2=80=94this third prototype you dr=
opped (
index.html

app.js
) is essentially a 
standalone UI shell
 for the 
SYMBI AI Builder
. It=E2=80=99s got:

Dashboard view
 =E2=86=92 stats for agents, conversations,=
 providers

Agents tab
 =E2=86=92 grid of AI agents, with create modal=
 (name, description, traits, provider, model, API key)

Conversations tab
 =E2=86=92 history list, styled with cha=
t UI

Settings tab
 =E2=86=92 API providers + key management

UI system
 =E2=86=92 polished design system, light/dark mo=
de, cards, grids, chat modals

=F0=9F=94=97 How It Fits With the O=
ther Prototypes

The 
Dockerized Synergy repo
 (MongoDB + Express + React) =
=E2=86=92 backend + persistent data.

The 
AI Builder prototype
 (this one) =E2=86=92 clean front=
end shell, dashboard UI.

Together =E2=86=92 they become 
Symbi=E2=80=99s operational plat=
form
:

Synergy handles 
agents, conversations, persistence
.

Builder provides a 
command chair UI
.

Core APIs we designed earlier (
/log
, 
/report
, 
/context
) plug into both.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What We Should Do

Unify
 =E2=86=92 Merge this Builder UI into the Synergy=
 frontend (
frontend/
) in=
stead of keeping it standalone.

Replace Synergy=E2=80=99s MUI fron=
tend with this 
polished dashb=
oard UI
.

Keep the styling (
style.css
) and adapt React components.

Wire Data
 =E2=86=92

Agents list =E2=86=92 backed by 
agent.model.js
 (MongoDB).

Conversations list =E2=86=92 backe=
d by 
conversation.model.js
.

Dashboard stats =E2=86=92 call bac=
kend endpoints to fetch counts.

Chat modal =E2=86=92 connected to =
multi-LLM orchestrator (LangChain layer in backend).

Extend Core APIs
 =E2=86=92

Add 
/report

Dashboard Overview
 (Symbi=E2=80=99s daily disp=

Add
