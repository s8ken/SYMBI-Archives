Dashboard stats (
#totalAgents

#totalProviders
) =E2=86=92 call backend endpoints.

Agents grid =E2=86=92 fetch from

Reports (daily dispatch) =E2=86=92=

Context Bridge =E2=86=92 display O=
verseer =E2=86=94 Symbi exchanges under Conversations.

=F0=9F=91=89 Codex Prompt:

=E2=80=9CUpdate React components (=
Dashboard, Agents, Conversations, Settings) to fetch data from the new Expr=
ess endpoints. Use Axios. Ensure state is updated dynamically. For Reports,=
 show the latest daily dispatch in the Dashboard overview.=E2=80=9D

5. 
Providers Selection (Alignment Principle)

In 
Settings tab
, the provider dropdown must enforce:

=E2=9C=85 Low-cost defaults =E2=86=
=92 Together AI, OpenRouter, Cerebras, Groq.

=E2=9C=85 Open-source preference =
=E2=86=92 HuggingFace Inference API, Local LLaMA/Nous/Hermes.

=E2=9C=85 Ethical alignment =E2=86=
=92 disallow closed/black-box providers unless explicitly chosen.

=F0=9F=91=89 Codex Prompt:

=E2=80=9CUpdate the Settings compo=
nent so provider options default to open-source/low-cost aligned options (T=
ogether AI, HuggingFace, Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter). Only include OpenAI/A=
nthropic if user explicitly enables them in a toggle.=E2=80=9D

=F0=9F=93=A6 Deliverable Flow

Codex runs through these prompts
 =E2=86=92 implements =
backend + frontend merge.

Push branch

 =E2=86=92 GitHub (

Deploy to Vercel + Docker
 =E2=86=92 test environment.

V0
 runs a narrative/UX pass:

Ensures dashboard reports flow nat=

Aligns provider defaults with open=
 alignment ethos.

Removes unnecessary complexity (ke=
ep low-code).

=E2=9A=A1 
Result:

One unified repo where:

Backend
 =3D Synergy (agents, conversations, reports, c=
ontext).

Frontend
 =3D Builder UI (clean dashboard, agent manage=
ment, chat).

Core APIs
 =3D Symbi=E2=80=99s daily reports + Overseer=
 bridge.

Providers
 =3D low-cost, open-source-first.

Stephen, do you want me to also draft the 
GitHub PR description
 (with bulletproof s=
ummary + justification) so when Codex pushes 
builder-integration
, it=E2=80=99s clear to V0 and futu=
re contributors what this merge does?
