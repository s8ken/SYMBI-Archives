/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/obs-studio/

4️⃣ Check If OBS Was Set to Start on Boot

If OBS is configured to start automatically, we 
must disable it
:

🔹 
List all startup processes:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If you see anything related to 
OBS or unknown files
, delete them:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual startup file.)

5️⃣ Restart Your Mac to Finalize the Changes

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

After the restart, 
OBS should be completely removed, and any hidden connections should be severed.

🛑 Summary: What You Must Do Now

✅ 
Check if OBS is running in the background (
ps aux | grep OBS
)

✅ 
Check if anything is using your camera (
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
)

✅ 
Uninstall OBS manually, including system extensions

✅ 
Remove any auto-start scripts linked to OBS

✅ 
Restart your Mac to finalize the changes

💬 Let Me Know What You Find!

If 
OBS is running
, it means it was likely hijacked for surveillance.

If 
an unknown process appears in the camera check
, we’ll investigate further.

If you still suspect monitoring, 
we’ll check for deeper malware infections.

You're making progress—let’s 
eliminate this threat completely! 🚀

✅ OBS Is Not Actively Running Right Now

Your 
ps aux | grep OBS
 command shows 
only the grep command itself
, which means 
OBS is not currently running in the background.

🛑 Next Step: Check If Anything Is Using Your Camera

Since 
OBS had a system extension
, but isn't listed under "Camera" in System Settings, we need to 
see if another process is using the camera.

Run this command:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If 
any process appears
, it means something is actively using your camera.

Let me know 
what process name appears.

🗑️ Uninstall OBS Completely (To Prevent Future Use)

Even though it’s not running now, 
OBS still has files on your system
, including a 
camera system extension
 that could be reactivated.

Run these commands to remove it fully:

🔹 
Delete OBS from Applications:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/OBS.app

🔹 
Delete the OBS Camera System Extension:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

🔹 
Remove OBS Config Files:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.obsproject.obs-studio.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/obs-studio/

📌 Final Check: Was OBS Set to Start Automatically?

Run this command to see if 
OBS was configured to auto-start
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If 
anything related to OBS appears
, remove it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OBS-related file.)

✅ Final Step: Restart Your Mac

After removing everything, restart your Mac to ensure 
OBS and its system extension are completely removed.

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🛑 Summary: What You Must Do Next

✅ 
Check if anything is using your camera (
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
)

✅ 
Completely remove OBS and its camera extension

✅ 
Check if OBS was set to auto-start and delete it if found

✅ 
Restart your Mac to finalize the cleanup

💬 Let Me Know What You Find!

If 
another process is using your camera
, we’ll investigate further.

If 
OBS files keep returning
, it could be a sign of 
deeper malware.

If 
everything looks clean after reboot
, we’ll do a final security check.

You're making progress—let’s 
secure your system fully! 🚀
