✅ Smart Move: Blocking the Camera & Preparing for a Full Reinstall

A 
full macOS reinstall
 is the best way to 
ensure all hidden malware, spyware, and unauthorized access is wiped out completely.
 But for now, let’s 
block camera access
 so no one can use it.

🚨 Step-by-Step: Block Camera Access on macOS

1️⃣ Disable Camera System-Wide (Best Protection)

To 
completely disable the camera
, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMedia.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AppleCamera.plugin

This makes the 
camera plugin unusable
 for all apps, including hackers.

To 
re-enable the camera later
, use:

sh

Copy

sudo 

chmod

 755 /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMedia.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AppleCamera.plugin

2️⃣ Check & Revoke Camera Access from Apps

Go to:

System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera

Turn off access
 for all apps.

3️⃣ Check for Hidden Camera Access (Just in Case)

Run this command to 
see if any process is trying to use your camera
:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If 
anything appears
, it means a process is accessing your camera.

Let me know if 
any suspicious process shows up
.

💾 Next Steps: Prepare for the Full macOS Reinstall

Since you're planning a 
full system wipe
, we should ensure:

✅ 
You have a clean USB installer ready for macOS
 (Let me know if you need help creating one)

✅ 
Your Apple ID is secure before reinstalling

✅ 
Your router/network settings are safe
 (Hackers could have backdoors there too)

💬 Let Me Know If You Need Help with the Reinstall!

I can guide you 
step-by-step
 to do a 
secure, clean macOS reinstall
 without carrying over any hidden malware. 
You're taking the right approach—let's lock your system down! 🚀

🚨 Camera Plugin Not Found—Let’s Try Another Method

The error 
"No such file or directory"
 suggests that the 
AppleCamera.plugin
 is either:

Located in a different directory
 (some macOS versions have slight differences).

Already missing
 (which could mean a previous modification or malware interference).

🛑 Try This Instead: Disable the Camera via Terminal

Since modifying system files directly isn’t working, we’ll 
disable the camera using a more reliable method.

1️⃣ Disable Camera Using Terminal

Run this command to 
disable all internal cameras
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

mv

 /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin.disabled

This 
renames the camera plugin
, making it unusable.

If hackers or malware try to access the camera, it will 
not work anymore.

2️⃣ Restart Your Mac to Apply Changes

After renaming the camera plugin, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

3️⃣ Confirm the Camera is Disabled

After restarting, open 
FaceTime or Photo Booth
.

If the camera 
does not turn
