g as an 
AirPlay receiver
 (which could allow another device to stream to it):

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active

If the output is 
1

, your Mac is set up as an AirPlay receiver.

If 
0

, it’s disabled.

If 
1
 appears and you didn’t enable it, disable it with:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

3. Check for Mirroring or Remote Access Processes

Run this to look for any screen-sharing or remote control processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screensharing|airplay|vnc'

If 
anything appears other than 
grep
 itself
, let me know so we can investigate further.

Try these steps and let me know what you find! If you see anything unusual in the logs or processes, we can dig deeper.

Since the log search for 
com.apple.AirPlay
 returned no results, it means there have been 
no recorded AirPlay events in the past hour
. That’s a good sign—there’s no recent AirPlay activity.

However, if you suspect past unauthorized use, you might want to expand the search:

Try searching for the last 
24 hours
 instead:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.AirPlay"'

 --last 24h

If that also returns nothing, AirPlay hasn’t been actively used recently.

Next Steps: Check If Your Mac Is an AirPlay Receiver

To see if your Mac is set up to 
receive AirPlay streams
, run:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active

If the output is 
1

, AirPlay receiving is 
enabled
, meaning another device could stream to your Mac.

If the output is 
0

, AirPlay receiving is 
disabled
 (which is the safer setting).

If it's 
1
 and you didn’t enable it, you can turn it off with:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

This command requires your 
admin password
, but it won’t display the password when you type.

Final Check: Look for Suspicious Mirroring or Remote Access Processes

Since you’re concerned about possible mirroring, let’s check if any 
remote access or screen-sharing
 processes are running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screensharing|airplay|vnc'

Let me know what appears in the output! If we see anything unusual, we’ll investigate further.

Your output shows that 
no active screen-sharing, AirPlay, or VNC (remote access) processes
 are running. The only thing listed is the 
grep
 command itself (which is normal) and a process related to 
FairPlay DRM (
fairplayd
)
, which is Apple's digital rights management system for protecting content.

What This Means:

No active remote access, screen-sharing, or AirPlay streaming is detected at the moment.

Your Mac is not currently being mirrored or accessed via VNC.

FairPlay (
fairplayd
) is unrelated to mirroring—it's part of Apple's DRM for media playback.

Final Step: Check if AirPlay Receiving is Enabled
