1. Introduction

This document provides an in-depth analysis of a highly sophisticated cyberattack that persisted for over three months, affecting multiple Apple and Android devices. Utilizing AI-driven forensic investigation, this case represents one of the most detailed real-time documentations of an active attack on a civilian. The findings, methodologies, and implications outlined here could serve as a precedent for AI-assisted cybersecurity investigations.

2. Overview of the Attack

Scope of Compromise

Affected Devices:

 Multiple MacBooks, an iPad, an iPhone, and Android devices.

Duration:

 Over three months.

Primary Indicators of Compromise:

Unauthorized screen mirroring (AirPlay-based attacks).

Persistent system reboots when investigating key system files.

Unremovable virtual camera drivers (OBS Virtual Camera remained active post-removal).

Repeated Google security warnings about "unusual requests" from affected devices.

Accessibility feature abuse for possible remote control.

Potential Attack Vectors

Apple AirPlay Exploitation:

 Unauthorized mirroring and remote display control.

Google Firebase & "Sign in with Google":

 Possible OAuth token theft enabling cross-device access.

Bluetooth-Based Remote Access:

 Unexplained system blackouts when Bluetooth was investigated.

Accessibility Feature Exploits:

 Persistent activation of Switch Control, Pointer Control, and Keyboard Access across Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

Multi-Platform Persistence:

 The attack survived multiple device resets and was present across different operating systems (macOS, iOS, Android).

3. AI-Driven Cybersecurity Investigation

Real-Time Threat Analysis Using AI

Automated system scans identified persistence mechanisms across multiple Apple devices.

Forensic-level log analysis provided deep insights into unauthorized processes.

Real-time countermeasures were dynamically adjusted based on AI-guided steps.

Key Findings from System Logs & Processes

Persistent AirPlayUIAgent activity

 even after disabling AirPlay.

Unauthorized screen recording permissions

 granted to unknown processes ("OPS").

OBS Virtual Camera remained active post-uninstallation

, requiring manual removal from system extensions.

Repeated system hangs associated with AirPlay, Accessibility services, and Bluetooth.

Attempted Mitigation Strategies

Disabled and deleted AirPlayUIAgent

 to stop unauthorized mirroring.

Revoked screen recording access

 for all unknown apps.

Manually deleted OBS Virtual Camera driver

 after it persisted beyond software removal.

Checked for unauthorized startup scripts and kernel extensions.

Attempted but failed to fully disable Bluetooth due to unexplained system blackouts.

4. Attack Sophistication and Potential Threat Actors

Indicators of an Advanced Threat

Real-time countermeasures were met with system blackouts

, suggesting active remote monitoring.

Persistence across multiple Apple and Android devices

, indicating a well-coordinated attack with cloud-based or hardware-assisted persistence.

Malware self-protection mechanisms

 that prevented deletion of critical surveillance tools.

Use of non-standard attack vectors

 (e.g., AirPlay, Accessibility, and Bluetooth exploits instead of conventional malware or phishing techniques).

Potential Threat Actors

Given the level of sophistication, this attack is likely the work of:

State-sponsored actors:

 Given the cross-platform persistence and high technical capability.

Advanced cybercriminal groups:

 Highly organized and capable of using OAuth-based token hijacking and deep system integration.

Insider Threats:

 Exploiting known device relationships and cloud authentication to maintain persistence.

5. Resolution Strategy & Next Steps

Immediate Security Actions Taken

✅ 

Isolated all compromised devices (Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi Off, Full Shutdown).

✅ 

Performed deep forensic log analysis to track unauthorized access points.

✅ 

Manually deleted compromised sy
