ve been concerned about device mirroring, let's do one last check:

Run this command to see if 
your Mac is set up to receive AirPlay streams
:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active

If the result is 
1

, AirPlay receiving is 
enabled
, meaning another device could stream to your Mac.

If 
0

, it is 
disabled
, which is the safer setting.

If 
1
 appears and you didn’t enable it, you can disable it with:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

Summary of Findings So Far:

✅ 
No active AirPlay streaming detected

✅ 
No screen-sharing or VNC processes running

✅ 
No recent AirPlay events in the logs

Let me know the result of the 
AirPlay receiver check
 so we can confirm your system is secure.

Final Analysis: No Signs of Active AirPlay or Mirroring

Your results confirm that 
AirPlay and screen-sharing are not currently active
 on your Mac:

✅ 
No recent AirPlay logs
 → No evidence of streaming or mirroring activity.

✅ 
No screen-sharing, VNC, or AirPlay processes running
 → No remote access detected.

✅ 
AirPlay receiver setting does not exist
 → This means 
your Mac is not configured as an AirPlay receiver
, so other devices cannot stream to it.

What This Means for Your Security Concerns

Your Mac does not currently appear to be compromised via AirPlay mirroring.

There is no active screen-sharing or VNC remote control process running.

AirPlay receiving is not enabled, meaning another device cannot send a stream to your Mac.

This suggests that if 
AirPlay or mirroring was used in the past
, it is no longer active. If you still suspect a compromise, we can look deeper into past logs, startup processes, or network activity to see if something was previously active and then disabled.

Would you like to investigate further, or does this ease your concerns for now?

Analysis of the 1st Hang Report

Your Mac experienced a 
TextEdit application hang
 that lasted 
251 seconds (over 4 minutes)
 before the system sampled the process.

Key Observations:

TextEdit Hang Cause:

The issue appears related to 
NSSavePanel
, which is responsible for saving files.

The process was stuck in a layout operation involving 
NSTextView
 and 
NSTextViewportLayoutController
, which manage text rendering.

This suggests TextEdit might have frozen while trying to 
save or render a document
.

System Context at the Time:

Accessory Updater (
accessoryupdaterd
) was running
 – This process updates Apple accessories.

Accountsd (
accountsd
) was running
 – Manages user accounts and Apple ID credentials.

AirPlayUIAgent was active
 – This is concerning because it hand
