🚨 macOS Blocking THOR Lite—How to Bypass Gatekeeper

Since THOR Lite isn’t from the App Store, macOS 
Gatekeeper
 is blocking it. Here’s how to bypass this and allow it to run:

1️⃣ Manually Approve THOR Lite

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security

Scroll down to 
Security

You’ll see a message saying:

"THOR Lite was blocked because it is not from an identified developer."

Click 
"Allow Anyway"

2️⃣ Try Running It Again

Now, return to 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx

This time, 
macOS may still warn you
, but it will now give you the option to 
run it anyway
.

3️⃣ (If Needed) Force Run via Terminal

If you still get blocked, try this command:

sh

Copy

sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./thor-lite-macosx

Then, 
run THOR Lite again
:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx

💬 Let Me Know If This Works!
