how do I add the license?

ChatGPT said:

Great question! To add the 
THOR Lite license
, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Move the License File to the THOR Lite Folder

If your license file (
thor-license.txt
) is in the 
Downloads
 folder, move it to the THOR Lite directory with this command:

sh

Copy

mv

 ~/Downloads/thor-license.txt /Applications/thor10/

2️⃣ Verify the License File is in the Right Place

After moving the file, check that it’s inside the 
THOR Lite directory
 by running:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Applications/thor10/

You should see 

thor-license.txt

 listed.

3️⃣ Run THOR Lite with the License

Now, try running the scanner again:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx

If everything is set up correctly, it should 
start scanning without a license error.

File

this is what the file looks like should I rename it?

ChatGPT said:

Yes, you should rename the license file to 

thor-license.txt

 so that THOR Lite can recognize it.

1️⃣ Rename the File in Terminal

Run this command:

sh

Copy

mv

 /Applications/thor10/thor-lite-bedccd25-edfd91d3-20250228-20250831.lic /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

2️⃣ Verify the File is Correctly Named

Check that the rename worked by running:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Applications/thor10/

You should now see 
thor-license.txt
 in the list.

3️⃣ Run THOR Lite Again

Now, try running THOR Lite:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx

If the license is recognized, the scan should start.

You're in your 
home directory (

)
, but 
THOR Lite is inside 
/Applications/thor10/

.

1️⃣ Change to the THOR Lite Directory

Before running the command, navigate to the THOR Lite folder:

sh

Copy

cd

 /Applications/thor10/

2️⃣ Verify the Executable

Now, check the files to ensure 
THOR Lite is executable
:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l

You should see 
thor-lite-macosx
 listed. If it’s not marked as executable, fix it with:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x thor-lite-macosx

3️⃣ Run THOR Lite

Now, try running it again:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx
