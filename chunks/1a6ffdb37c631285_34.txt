It looks like the 
license file isn’t in the 
/Applications/thor10/
 folder
. Let's find it and move it to the correct location.

1️⃣ Find Where the License File Is

Run this command to locate the file:

sh

Copy

find ~/Downloads /Applications -name 

"thor-lite-*.lic"

This will 
search for the license file
 in the Downloads folder and Applications.

2️⃣ Move the File to the THOR Lite Folder

If the above command finds the file, move it to the correct location by running:

sh

Copy

mv

 /path/to/license/file /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

(Replace 
/path/to/license/file
 with the actual path shown in the search result.)

3️⃣ Verify the File is in the Right Place

Check if the file is now in the correct folder:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/

You should see 

thor-license.txt

 listed.

4️⃣ Run THOR Lite Again

Once the license file is in the right place, try:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license ./thor-license.txt

💬 Let Me Know What You Find!

If the file 
is missing or won’t move
, we may need to 
re-download the license
 from Nextron Systems. 🚀

You said:

yes it worked I am getting scam modes and scan options etc.

ChatGPT said:

Awesome! 🎉 That means THOR Lite is now running properly!

Now, you can 
choose a scan mode
 and let it analyze your system. I recommend starting with:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --quick

This 
runs a fast scan
 to check for common threats.

If you want a 
deeper analysis
, you can use:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --full

This takes longer but is 
more thorough
.

💬 What’s Next?

If the scan 
detects anything suspicious
, let me know, and we’ll analyze the results together.

If you get any 
errors or warnings
, send me the details, and I’ll help troubleshoot.

You're doing great—let's see what THOR Lite finds! 🚀🔍

Got it! It looks like THOR Lite doesn't use 
--full
, so let's check the 
correct scan options.

1️⃣ View All Available Scan Options

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --fullhelp

This will show 
all possible scan modes
.

2️⃣ Recommended Scan Modes

Based on the official 

THOR manual

, try these:

Quick Scan (Faster)

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --quick

Runs a 
light scan
 that checks key areas of your system.

Good for a 
first check
 if you're short on time.

Deep Scan (Thorough)

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --intense

Scans 
all files
 and processes.

Takes 
longer
 but detects more advanced threats.

Scan with Logging (Recommended)

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --intense --logfile thor-scan.log

Saves scan results to 

thor-scan.log

 for later review.

3️⃣ Run Your Chosen Scan

Try 

--quick

 first if you're unsure.

If you have time, use 

--intense

 for a 
full security check
.

💬 Let Me Know If You Get Any Findings!

If THOR Lite 
flags anything suspicious
, copy the results here, and I’ll help analyze them. 🚀🔍
