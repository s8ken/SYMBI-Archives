nse.txt

If the file 
doesn’t exist
 or is empty, we need to fix it.

2️⃣ Ensure the License File Matches Your Hostname

THOR Lite 
only works if the license matches your Mac’s hostname.

Run this command:

sh

Copy

hostname

If it shows 

Mes-MacBook-Pro.local

, your license 
must be generated for this exact hostname
.

If your license was created for 
a different hostname
, you need to 
re-request it from Nextron Systems
.

3️⃣ Manually Point to the License File

Try running THOR Lite 
with the license file specified manually
:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If this works, then the scanner was just 
not automatically detecting the file
.

4️⃣ If It Still Fails, Request a New License

If the above steps 
don’t work
, you likely need a 
new license file
.

Go to 

THOR Lite License Page

Enter your 
exact hostname (
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
)
 when requesting a license.

Download it and replace the old file in 
/Applications/thor10/
.

💬 Let Me Know If This Works!

If you still get 
“No valid license file found”
, let me know what 
ls -l thor-license.txt
 and 
hostname
 show, and we’ll troubleshoot further. 🚀

🚨 THOR Lite Still Can't Find the License—Final Fixes

Your 
license file exists
 (
thor-license.txt
), but THOR Lite 
isn't recognizing it.
 Let's go through the final fixes step by step.

1️⃣ Check If the License File is Corrupted

Run:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

You should see 
license text
 inside the file.

If the file is empty
 or looks corrupted, you’ll need to 
re-download it
 from Nextron.

If the text looks fine
, move on to the next step.

2️⃣ Manually Specify the License File in the Command

Try running THOR Lite with the 
license path explicitly defined
:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If this works, then the scanner was just 
not automatically detecting the file
.

3️⃣ Check If THOR Lite Can Read the License File

The issue may be 
permissions
. Run:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If it shows 

rw-r--r--

, that means only your user can access it.

To 
ensure THOR Lite can read the file
, try:

sh

Copy

sudo 

chmod

 644 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

Then retry:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx

4️⃣ If It Still Fails, Request a New License

If nothing works, the issue is likely that the 
license does not match your exact hostname (
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
)
.

Go to 

THOR Lite License Page

Enter your 
exact hostname (
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
)
 when requesting a new license.

Download it and 
replace
 the old license file in 
/Applications/thor10/
.

💬 Let Me Know If This Works!

If you 
still get a license error
, let me know the output of:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt
hostname

And we’ll troubleshoot further! 🚀

1️⃣ Rename the License File

Move and rename the newly downloaded license file to

2️⃣ Verify the File is in the Right Place

Check that it's correctly named and in the 
thor10
 folder:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/

You should see 

thor-license.txt

 listed.

3️⃣ Set Correct Permissions
