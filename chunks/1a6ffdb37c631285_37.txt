It looks like 
THOR Lite doesn’t use 
--license

 as a valid flag. Since you’ve already placed the license in the correct folder, let’s try running the scan without specifying the license manually.

1️⃣ Run a Quick Scan

Since the license file is in place, try running:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --quick

This will start a 
fast scan
 of your system.

2️⃣ If You Want a More Thorough Scan

For a 
deeper scan
, use:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx -e /Applications/thor10/

This will store the 
scan logs
 in the 
thor10
 folder.

3️⃣ If There’s Still a License Error

Run this to check if THOR Lite sees the file:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

And verify your hostname again:

sh

Copy

hostname

If they match but it 
still doesn’t work
, the license 
may be corrupted
, and we’ll need to re-download it.

🚨 THOR Lite Still Can't Detect the License – Let's Fix It

Your 
license file is in the correct location
, but THOR Lite 
still isn’t recognizing it
. This could be due to:

The license not matching your hostname

A formatting issue with the license file

THOR Lite looking in the wrong location

1️⃣ Verify Your Hostname Matches the License

Run this command:

sh

Copy

hostname

It 
must match exactly
 with what you entered when requesting the THOR Lite license.

If 
hostname
 does 
not
 return 
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
, then the license is incorrect, and you need to 
re-download it using the correct hostname
.

If they match, move to step 2.

2️⃣ Check the License File’s Content

Run:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If the file 
is empty or contains incorrect data
, the license may have been corrupted.

If it 
contains license details
, move to step 3.

3️⃣ Try Manually Moving the License

Let’s ensure THOR Lite can find the file by moving it to 

/etc/

, which is a more common location for license files:

sh

Copy

sudo 

cp

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt /etc/thor-license.txt

Then try running THOR Lite again:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx

4️⃣ If It Still Fails, Re-Download the License

If nothing works, you’ll need a 
new license tied to the correct hostname
:

Go to 

THOR Lite License Page

Enter the exact hostname (
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
)

Download the new license file and move it to 
/Applications/thor10/

💬 Let Me Know What Happens!

If it 
still fails
, send me the output of:

sh

Copy

hostname

cat

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

We’ll troubleshoot further! 🚀

Your hostname 
matches
 the one in the error message, so the problem is 
not a hostname mismatch
. Let's focus on making sure THOR Lite can properly detect the license file.

1️⃣ Check the License File’s Content

Run this command to see what’s inside the license file:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If it’s 
empty
 or contains 
unexpected characters
, the license might be corrupted.

If it looks normal, move to the next step.
