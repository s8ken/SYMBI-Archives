is it possible I was being broadcast here?

ChatGPT said:

It's 
definitely possible
 that an attacker could have used 
YouStream
 or a similar broadcasting app to secretly stream or mirror your screen/camera. Since YouStream is designed to 
broadcast directly to YouTube
, it could have been used as part of an attack.

🚨 Possible Signs You Were Broadcast via YouStream

If you suspect unauthorized streaming, here’s what might have happened:

✔ 
Unusual Camera or Microphone Usage
 – Your camera/mic being active when you're not using them.

✔ 
Background App Activity
 – A hidden or unfamiliar app running in the background.

✔ 
Strange YouTube Activity
 – Unauthorized live streams appearing on your YouTube account.

✔ 
High Data Usage
 – A sudden increase in data usage, possibly from video streaming.

✔ 
Google/Firebase Connection
 – You mentioned Firebase earlier, which could have been used for authentication or broadcasting control.
