AirPlayUIAgent Activity

The presence of 
AirPlayUIAgent
 suggests AirPlay was at least 
initialized
.

There is no direct evidence that an active AirPlay session was in progress, but its presence could indicate some 
background interaction
 with AirPlay services.

Next Steps:

Check if AirPlayUIAgent is Persistently Running

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep AirPlayUIAgent

If you see an entry (besides 
grep
), AirPlayUIAgent is still running.

If you didn’t manually enable AirPlay, this might indicate unwanted activity.

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process == "AirPlayUIAgent"'

 --last 24h

past 24 hours
 related to AirPlayUIAgent.

Check System Settings:

Go to 
System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff
 and check if 
"Allow AirPlay Receiver"
 is enabled.

If it is 
on
, consider turning it 
off
 unless you need it.

If your Mac is unexpectedly acting as an AirPlay receiver, disable it using:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool
