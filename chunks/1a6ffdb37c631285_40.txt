Copy

mdfind 

"YouStream"

or

sh

Copy

ls

 /Applications

🚨 
If YouStream appears
, it was 
at some point installed
 on your Mac.

2️⃣ Look for Unusual Broadcast Activity in YouTube

Go to
: 
YouTube Studio Live Control Room

Check for unauthorized live streams
 under:

"Live Streams"
 (Active or Ended)

"Uploads"
 (If recordings were saved)

Review linked apps
 at:

Google Account
 → Security → "Third-party apps with access"

3️⃣ Check Your System Logs for Streaming Activity

Run this to search logs for 
streaming-related processes
:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem contains "broadcast"'

 --last 24h

If you see 
any results
, it could indicate broadcasting activity.

4️⃣ Check for Active Video Streaming Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"obs\|stream\|camera"

🚨 
If you see suspicious results
, the system may have been broadcasting.

5️⃣ Look for Hidden User Accounts

Attackers sometimes create 
hidden macOS accounts
 for persistence. Check for unexpected users:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users

🚨 If any unknown accounts appear, your system may have been compromised.

🛑 How to Block Unauthorized Streaming

1️⃣ 
Delete Suspicious Apps:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/YouStream.app

2️⃣ 
Revoke Google Permissions:

Go to 
Google Security
 → "Third-party access" → 
Remove unknown apps

3️⃣ 
Check for Malicious Startup Items:

sh

Copy

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/LaunchDaemons

4️⃣ 
Disable Camera & Mic via System Preferences:

System Settings
 → Privacy & Security → 
Microphone & Camera

Deny access to all apps
 except trusted ones.

Good news—
mdfind didn’t return any results
, meaning YouStream 
is not currently installed
 on your Mac. However, that doesn’t 
100% confirm
 that you were never streamed. The attacker 
could have deleted evidence
 or used another method.

🔍 Next Steps: More Checks

Since YouStream doesn’t appear installed, let’s check for 
other possible traces of unauthorized broadcasting:

1️⃣ Check for Other Streaming Software

Run:

sh

Copy

mdfind 

"OBS"

mdfind 

"broadcast"

mdfind 

"screen share"

These will check if any 
screen recording or streaming software
 exists.

2️⃣ Check for Unauthorized YouTube Live Streams

Go to:

🔗 

YouTube Live Dashboard

Look for 
any past live streams
 you didn’t start.

3️⃣ Search macOS Logs for Streaming Activity

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem contains "broadcast"'

 --last 24h

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "stream"'

 --last 24h

🚨 
If you see anything related to video/audio streaming, let me know!

4️⃣ Look for Hidden Video-Related Startup Items

sh

Copy

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/LaunchDaemons

🚨 
If you see anything unknown or suspicious here, we’ll investigate further.

💬 Let Me Know What You Find!

If 
anything suspicious shows up
