🛑 Immediate Steps to Investigate & Stop Further Attacks

1️⃣ Review the Suspicious Files

Open 
Finder
 and go to:

📂 

/Users/Shared/10/

Check 
if the screen recording and screenshots are visible
.

If they are 
not yours
, this confirms 
unauthorized activity
.

2️⃣ Check for Active Streaming Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"obs\|broadcast\|screen"

🚨 
If anything is running
, we need to force-stop it.

3️⃣ Check macOS Screen Recording Permissions

Run:

sh

Copy

tccutil dump ScreenCapture

If 
unknown apps
 have screen recording access, they could have been used for spying.

4️⃣ Remove OBS Virtual Camera Extension

🚨 
This is critical!
 Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

Then 
restart your Mac
 to ensure it is fully removed.

5️⃣ Investigate ReplayKit Broadcasting

Check for ReplayKit activity using logs:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem contains "ReplayKit"'

 --last 7d

If 
ReplayKit was used for broadcasting
, it may show logs of past activity.

💬 Let Me Know What You Find!

screen recordings & screenshots are unauthorized

🚨 Finding Where the Screen Was Broadcasted

Since we now know 
your screen was recorded
, the next step is to find 
where it was streamed.

1️⃣ Search macOS Logs for Streaming Activity

Run the following command to check for 
streaming-related logs
:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "broadcast"'

 --last 7d

This will look for any mentions of 
broadcasting services
 (YouStream, OBS, ReplayKit, etc.).

If nothing appears, try expanding the search:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "stream"'

 --last 7d

🚨 
If you see URLs, IP addresses, or app names, send me the results.

2️⃣ Check for Live Streaming URLs in Browser History

Since attackers may have streamed to 
YouTube, Twitch, or another platform
, check browser history for suspicious links:

Safari

sh

Copy

sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%youtube.com/live%' OR url LIKE '%twitch.tv%' OR url LIKE '%stream%';"

Google Chrome

sh

Copy

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History 

"SELECT url FROM urls WHERE url LIKE '%youtube.com/live%' OR url LIKE '%twitch.tv%' OR url LIKE '%stream%';"

🚨 
If you see unfamiliar live stream links, copy them and check their status.

3️⃣ Check YouTube Live & Google Account History

Go to YouTube Live Dashboard
:

🔗 
https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard

Check for past live streams under 
"Live Streams"

Check Google Security Activity
:

🔗 
https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup

Look for 
unauthorized sign-ins
 or 
newly connected apps.

4️⃣ Look for Suspicious Network Connections

Attackers may have streamed directly via 
RTMP (Real
