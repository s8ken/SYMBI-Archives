ss was 
activated, then invalidated, then reactivated
 repeatedly.

This cycling behavior can indicate an 
attempt to start AirPlay mirroring or streaming
.

This strongly suggests that 
AirPlay screen mirroring was attempted at some point
.

AirPlayXPCHelper Interactions

AirPlayUIAgent repeatedly tried to establish connections with 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, which handles AirPlay-related communications.

There were multiple connection failures, suggesting it 
might have been trying to mirror to a device that was unavailable
.

TCC Access Request

TCCAccessRequest
 logs appear, which means 
AirPlay requested permission to access certain system features
.

This is usually needed when an app or process 
tries to access screen recording, microphone, or camera permissions
.

AirPlayUIAgent Not Always in Foreground

Some logs show it was 
registered as a background process
.

This could indicate that 
AirPlay mirroring was attempted in the background
, without an obvious on-screen prompt.

What This Means

⚠️ 
There is clear evidence that AirPlay mirroring was attempted.

✅ However, it appears the mirroring 
may not have been successful
, as many connection attempts failed.

❓ The real question: 
Was this initiated by you, or was it unauthorized?

Next Steps

1. Disable AirPlay Receiving (if enabled)

To prevent your Mac from accepting AirPlay connections, run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

(You’ll need to enter your Mac password.)

2. Stop AirPlayUIAgent from Running

To 
immediately stop AirPlayUIAgent
, run:

sh

Copy

killall AirPlayUIAgent

To 
prevent it from starting up again
, use:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

3. Check for Unauthorized Bluetooth or Network Devices

Since AirPlay mirroring can be triggered from another Apple device:

Go to System Settings > Bluetooth
 and check if any unknown devices are connected.

Check AirDrop settings
 in 
System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff
 and disable AirDrop if not needed.

4. Check Screen Recording Permissions

Go to 
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
 and check if any unexpected apps have permission.

Conclusion

🛑 
AirPlay mirroring was attempted multiple times, but it may not have succeeded.

🔎 
Next step: Disable AirPlayUIAgent and AirPlay receiving to block future attempts.
