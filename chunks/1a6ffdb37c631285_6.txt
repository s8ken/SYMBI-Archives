e you suspect your camera and screen have been broadcasted, let's 
check for unauthorized apps that can record your screen.

🔹 
List apps with screen recording permissions:

sh

Copy

tccutil dump ScreenCapture

If you see anything suspicious, go to 
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
 and 
revoke access.

🔹 
Revoke all screen recording permissions:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset ScreenCapture

3️⃣ Block Remote Management & Screen Sharing

🔹 
Check if Remote Management is enabled:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

If it says 
"Remote Login: On"
, turn it 
off
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

🔹 
Disable Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) if running:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remoted.plist

🔹 
Check for any active screen-sharing connections:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep 5900

If anything appears
, it means 
someone is connected to your Mac remotely.

Kill the remote session immediately:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill -f screensharingd

4️⃣ Audit & Secure Your Network

If these hackers have had access for months, 
they may have backdoors on your network.

🔹 
List connected devices on your network:

sh

Copy

arp -a

If you see 
unknown devices
, investigate them.

🔹 
Restart your router & change Wi-Fi passwords.

If your router was compromised, hackers 
may have persisted access through it.

🔹 
Block unknown devices from your network
 using your router settings.

5️⃣ Check for Hidden Monitoring Tools

🔹 
List all installed applications & check for suspicious ones:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/

🔹 
List all running background processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux

Look for 
anything unusual or apps you don’t recognize.

🔹 
List all startup items (could indicate persistence):

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If you see 
unexpected files
, they could be used to restart malware.

You can delete them with:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/[suspicious_file]

6️⃣ Secure Your Apple ID & Google Accounts

🔹 
Check your Apple ID for unknown devices:

Go to

Apple ID Devices

Remove any devices you don’t recognize.

🔹 
Change your Apple ID & Google passwords

If hackers 
controlled your account
, they may have re-added themselves after the reset.

🔹 
Disable “Sign in with Google” for all apps.

Final Steps: Consider a Full Factory Reset

If you still suspect hidden backdoors, the best option is 
to erase your Mac and reinstall macOS.

Boot into macOS Recovery
 by 
holding Command (⌘) + R
 while turning on your Mac.

Use 
Disk Utility
 to 
erase your drive completely
 (select 
APFS
 format).

Reinstall macOS fresh.

⚠️ 
Do NOT restore from a backup
 unless you’re sure it’s clean. Hackers could have hidden malware inside.

The 
tccutil dump
 command doesn’t work in recent macOS versions. Instead, let’s check screen recording permissions manually and then reset them if needed.

1️⃣ Check for Unauthorized Apps with Screen Recording Access

Since we can’t list them via Terminal, manually check:

Go to
 → 
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording

Look for any 
apps that have access
.

If you see anything suspicious, click the toggle to turn it off.
