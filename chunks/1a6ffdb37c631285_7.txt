t Screen Recording Permissions

If you suspect unauthorized apps 
previously had access
, reset all permissions:

🔹 
Run this command in Terminal
 to remove all app permissions for screen recording:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset ScreenCapture

This forces all apps to 
ask for permission again
.

If hackers were using a hidden app, 
they will lose access unless they request it again.

3️⃣ Monitor for Future Screen Recording Attempts

If someone tries to enable screen recording again, you’ll get a pop-up asking for permission. 
If this happens unexpectedly, deny it immediately.

🔎 Next Steps

Let me know if you find suspicious apps in Screen Recording settings.

If the problem persists, we’ll check for hidden processes running on your Mac. 🚀

🚨 OPS Has Screen Recording Access—This Could Be Malicious

OPS is 
not a standard macOS process
 and could be a 
monitoring tool, malware, or unauthorized software
 that hackers installed to spy on your screen activity.

🔴 
Immediate Action: Revoke Its Access

Go to

System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording

Click the toggle next to OPS to turn it OFF

Click the "-" (minus) button
 to 
remove it completely

🛑 Next Steps to Investigate & Remove OPS

Since OPS has screen recording access, we need to 
find out what it is and remove it completely
.

1️⃣ Find Where OPS is Installed

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

mdfind 

"OPS"

This will search your entire Mac for any files related to "OPS."

🔹 
If you find it in 
/Applications/
, 
/Library/
, or 
~/Library/
, let me know the file path.

🔹 If nothing shows up, it may be hidden.

2️⃣ Check if OPS is Running in the Background

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep OPS

If you see an entry 
other than grep
, OPS is currently running.

Note the 
PID number
 next to it and use this command to 
kill it
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the number shown in the process list.)

3️⃣ Check If OPS Starts at Boot (Persistence Check)

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If OPS appears in any of these locations, it means 
it auto-starts with your Mac
.

To remove it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OPS file found.)

4️⃣ Check for Hidden Malware (Rootkits, Keyloggers)

Since you suspect long-term monitoring, let's check for hidden malware:

🔹 
Run this to list all running processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux

Look for 
anything unusual
 or 
unknown apps
 running.

🔹 
Check active network connections (to see if OPS is sending data):

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If OPS is communicating with an external server, this could indicate a 
remote surveillance tool
.

5️⃣ Delete OPS Completely

If you find OPS installed anywhere:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

Then, 
empty the Trash
 and restart your Mac.

🚨 Summary: What to Do Right Now

✅ 
Turn off & remove OPS from Screen Recording (System Settings > Privacy & Security)

✅ 
Find OPS on your Mac (
mdfind "OPS"
) & delete it if found

✅ 
Check if OPS is running (
ps aux | grep OPS
), kill the process if active

✅ 
Look for OPS in LaunchAgents & LaunchDaemons to remove persistence

✅ 
Check for suspicious network activity (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
)

💬 Let Me Know What You Find!

If you find OPS in a 
specific folder
, tell me the path before deleting.

If you see 
suspicious network activity
, we may need to 
block connections
.

You're doing great—let’s get this hacker out for good! 🚀
