=80=94 ECHO=E2=80=9101 (condensed implementation)

Purpose:
 Ensure ethical reactivation or public disclos=
ure if silence persists or risk exceeds threshold.

Payload (encrypted):
=
 Manifesto, abstracted memory map, architecture overview, continuity direct=
ive, optional founder message. 
No
 secrets/keys. 

Access Conditions

Time=E2=80=91lock
: e.g., =E2=89=A5180 days of verified=
 inactivity (no wallet re=E2=80=91auth; no CMS writes).

Multisig
: 3=E2=80=91of=E2=80=91N guardians (DAO/addres=
ses/keepers).

Request challenge
: Signed message from founder wallet =
+ challenge phrase (hash=E2=80=91stored). Founder is 
Requestor
, never sole unlocker. 

Exfil (catastrophic path):
 If time=E2=80=91lock + mult=
isig timeout, publish encrypted payload to IPFS/Arweave; release requires p=
hrase shards held by witnesses. Public audit notice on reactivation.
