=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to 
guide you through checking your system profiles directly
 (in macOS/iOS settings), so you can quickly see if any suspicious prov=

Perfect =E2=80=94 here=E2=80=99s how you can 
manually check for suspicious provisioning profi=

Check installed profiles

=E2=9C=85 Normal: No profiles at all=

=E2=9C=85 Normal: Company MDM profil=

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Suspicious: Any unknown=

Consider reinstalling OS if you=E2=

=E2=9C=85 This manual check tells =
you quickly if a hacker used a

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to also prepare a

 (using

I see you=E2=80=99ve uploaded three new system-level fi=
les related to 
HTTP storage and e=
ncoding state
. Let=E2=80=99s break them down:

1. 
.CFUserTextEncoding

A tiny config file created in each u=
ser=E2=80=99s home directory on macOS.

Purpose:
 Stores your preferred text encoding and language=
.

=E2=9C=85 Normal: It usually just co=
ntains something like 
0x1F5:0x0:0=
x0
 (encoding IDs).

Risk:
 Very low =E2=80=94 not a hacking vector. Just user =
preferences.
