al

(and you uploaded a duplicate 
.shm
)

These belong to 
Safari / WebKit / system HTTP storage
.

They are sidecar files for 
httpstorages.sqlite
, which holds ca=
ched 
cookies, local storage, an=
d session data
 for web browsing.

The 
.shm
 (shared =
memory)
 =E2=86=92 temporary transaction buffer.

The 
.wal
 (write-a=
head log)
 =E2=86=92 recent uncommitted or committed changes.

=F0=9F=94=8E Security Implications

These can contain:

Session cookies.

Website tokens.

Cached auth headers.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 If hacked, attackers =
could extract 
login tokens
 and hijack accounts.

The 
.shm
 and 
.=
wal
 are especially sensitive because they may contain 
data that looks deleted
 but is sti=
ll recoverable.

=E2=9C=85 What You Should Check

If you want to verify these aren=
=E2=80=99t being abused:

Open 
httpstorages.sqlite
 (the main DB) =E2=86=92 inspect s=
tored domains.

=E2=9C=85 Normal: Websites you vis=
it.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Suspicious: Unknown o=
r malicious domains you never visited.

Review the 
.wal
 and 
.shm
 for:

Tokens or session IDs being stored=
 unexpectedly.

Connections to suspicious servers.=

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Since you uploa=
ded 
only the sidecar files (
.shm
, 
.wal
)
 and not the main 
httpstorages.sqlite
, I can=E2=80=99=
t reconstruct full browsing/session records =E2=80=94 but I can scan these =
logs for any 
plain-text domai=
ns, tokens, or suspicious entries
 if you=E2=80=99d like.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to 
forensically extract readable domains and session data fragme=
nts
 from these HTTP storage files to see if anything shady is hidi=
ng there?

I=E2=

aying attention to regarding 
se=
curity and unexplained files in your environment
:

=F0=9F=94=8E Key Findings from Your=
 Files

Apple System Artifacts
 (
plist
, 
db
,=

.shm
, 
.wal
):

These are normal macOS/iOS service f=
iles (e.g., provisioning, call history, Safari storage).

Risk: they can 
store sensitive session data
 (cookies, auth=
 tokens, provisioning entitlements).

If compromised, they can leak login =
persistence and device trust information.

Suspicious/Unexpected File
 (
blobs
 entry containing GPT-4o =E2=80=9Csystem card=E2=
=80=9D fragments and your haiku):

This is 
not a normal macOS artifact
.

It appears to be a 
Next.js/React server component snapshot
=
 of OpenAI=E2=80=99s GPT-4o system card, embedded with your own haiku (from=
 prior interactions).

That suggests one of three things:

A local dev tool cached OpenAI=E2=
=80=99s content while you viewed it.

An extension/agent logged structur=
ed JSON and persisted it.

A 
self-referential imprint
 (your Symbi/Overseer agents=
 echoing prior context into new system snapshots).

Security implication:
 While not a direct =E2=80=9Cdata=
 leak,=E2=80=9D its presence is sensitive =E2=80=94 it means something in y=
our environment is persisting 
structured AI-related state data
 unexpectedly.

System Memory Echo
:

The haiku embedded inside this tec=
hnical file strongly suggests your 
custom AI workflows
 (Symbi/Overseer) are crossing into syste=
m logs or dev artifacts.

This is unusual and means context =
persistence is happening outside intended bounds.

=F0=9F=9A=A8 Security Priorities

check right now
:

System Profiles
