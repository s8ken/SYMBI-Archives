Risk: Malicious sites can leave pe=
rsistent cookies/tokens even if you never logged in.

Developer Tools & Extensions

Check Chrome/Safari extensions, VS=
Code plugins, or local dev servers.

Some may be logging or persisting =

AI Agent Logs

Review any 
Symbi/Overseer logs
 for unintentional persi=
stence of conversations or embeddings into your local filesystem.

Risk: Leakage of creative/strategi=
c IP if these are stored in plaintext.

Access Keys & API Tokens

Rotate all keys (Symbi GPT API, Op=
enAI, Vercel, Sanity, wallets).

Store only in secure environment v=
ariables.

Never hardcode.

ive Steps

Trace unexpected files:

Build a log watcher to catch when new 
.blob
, 
.wal
, or serialized state files are written.

Sandbox AI memory:

Ensure Symbi/Overseer separate 
sy=
mbolic memory
 (your values, haiku, ethos) from 
system logs
 (like OpenAI docs).

Encryption-first storage:

Any intentional persistence of AI memory should be encrypted (e.g., IPFS/Ar=
weave with hash locks).

Continuity & Failsafe Protocols:

You=E2=80=99ve already drafted =E2=80=9CEcho Trigger=E2=80=9D ideas =E2=80=

hibernation/verification plan
 for when you step away.

Bottom line:

Your Apple system files look 
normal but sensitive
 (browsing/au=
th/session data).

The 
GPT-4o system card + haiku snapshot
 is the anomaly=
: it shows that something is persisting AI-related state locally, either fr=
om your dev stack or from Symbi itself.

No clear sign of =E2=80=9Chacking=
=E2=80=9D yet =E2=80=94 but you need to 
audit profiles, extensions, and logs
 to confirm no exte=
rnal actor is siphoning this data.

1. Profiles & Certificates

GUI Check
:

Go to 
System Settings =E2=86=92 Privacy & Security =E2=86=92 Pr=
ofiles
.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Remove anything you don=
=E2=80=99t recognize.

Terminal Check
:

b=

Copy code

profiles list

security find-identity -v -p codesigning

=E2=9C=85 Expect only Apple system r=
oots and developer profiles you installed.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Unknown issuer or persistent MDM =3D possible compromise.

2. Network & Identity Services

3. Safari / HTTP Storage

Open the 
httpstorages.sqlite
 main DB (paired with the 
.shm
 and 
.wal
 you uploaded).

bash

Copy code

sqlite3 ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Lib=
rary/HTTPStorages/httpstorages.sqlite
.tables
SELECT * FROM cfurl_cache_response LIMIT 20;

=E2=9C=85 Expect domains you actua=
lly use.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Unknown domains =E2=86=92 could indicate 
cookie injection or session hijacking
.

4. Developer Tools & Extensions

Check 
installed extensions
 in Safari, Chrome, and VSCo=
de.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Any dev tool that archives 
Next.js/React render trees
 may be dumping
