bash

Copy code

ls

 ~=
/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions

ls

 ~/Library=
/Safari/Extensions

Review unknown IDs by searching th=
em online.

5. File System Watch (for Blob/SHM/WAL files)

Set up a watcher to see 
who creates files like the GPT-4o system ca=
rd snapshot
.

bash

Copy code

sudo fs_usage | grep blob
sudo fs_usage | grep sqlite

This tells you which process is wr=
iting new blobs or session logs.

6. Symbi / Overseer Context Logs

If you=E2=80=99re running Symbi lo=
cally, audit its 
persistence =
layer
.

Check any directories where you st=
ore context snapshots.

Look for JSON or 
.blob
 files that contain haiku, manifest=
o fragments, or OpenAI structures.

7. General Malware/Compromise Check

Processes:

bash

Copy code

ps aux | grep -i agent
launchctl list

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Look for unknown back=
ground agents.

Startup Items:

bash

Copy code

ls

 ~=
/Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/=
LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/=
LaunchDaemons

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Unrecognized 
.plist
 files here =3D persistenc=
e mechanism.

=F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F What to Loo=
k For

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Dev tools
: If the file was generated by s=
omething like Vercel/Next.js/React DevTools, you=E2=80=99ll see references =
to 
node
, 
next
, 
vercel
, or 
de=
vtools
 processes creating 
.blob
 files.

=F0=9F=9F=A0 Symbi/Overseer
: If your own agents are pe=
rsisting context, the haiku will show up in 
your project=E2=80=99s log folders
, tied to Python/=
Node scripts you run.

=F0=9F=94=B4 External compromise
: If you find unknown =

profiles, root certs, or daem=
ons
 plus suspicious outbound connections =E2=86=92 that=E2=80=99s =
a hack.

=F0=9F=93=8C 
My Suggestion
: Start with steps 1 (Profil=
es) and 3 (Safari HTTP DB), since those are the most common hacker vectors.=
 Then set up the 
file system =
watch
 in step 5 to catch the exact process writing unusual blob/sh=
m/wal files.

Do you want me to 
write the exact SQLite queries and filters
 you can use on 
httpstorages.sqlite
 to quickly =
spot suspicious or malicious domains in your Safari session storage?

Normal use:

For forensic/security use:

They reveal 
which apps, docs, or volumes were accessed
.

Can help trace whether

Can expose 
unexpected file paths
 (e.g., suspicious blobs,=
 scripts, or unsigned apps).

=E2=9C=85 What You Should Check

In 
RecentApplications.sfl3
:

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Unknown apps you neve=
r installed/run.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Tools with generic na=
mes (like 
Updater
, 
Helper
, 
Agent
) that don=E2=80=99t match known softwar=
e.

In 
RecentDocuments.sfl3
:

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Files/scripts you nev=
er opened.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Anything in odd locat=
ions (e.g., 
/tmp/
, 
/private/var/
, hidden folders=
).

In
