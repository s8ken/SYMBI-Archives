The list of

The list of

Any 
mounted volumes or favorites

That would immediately show if the=

unknown or suspicious =
apps/documents
 in your environment.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to go ahead and 
parse and decode the 
.sfl3
 files
 you just uploaded so we can s=
ee if any suspicious applications, documents, or volumes are listed?

yes and just let me kn=

Here=E2=80=99s what I pulled out =
of your 
recent applications and r=
ecent documents lists
 (
.sf=
l3
 files):

=F0=9F=96=A5=EF=B8=8F Recent Applic=
ations

The list is mostly 
normal system entries
 (like 
System Settings
).

I didn=E2=80=99t see unknown =E2=80=
=9Cagent-like=E2=80=9D apps (e.g., malware with generic names such as 
Updater
 or 
Helper
).

=F0=9F=93=82 Recent Documents

Here=E2=80=99s where it gets interes=
ting. Among normal entries (like 
=
Untitled.rtf
, 
Desktop
 items), I also saw:

KTConfig.plist

 inside 
group.com.apple.swt=
ransparency

metadata.keychain-db

 inside your 
Library/=
Keychains

.com.apple.containermana=
gerd.metadata.plist

 inside 
group.com.apple.shortcuts

index.js

=
 inside an 
admin/symbi-agent/node=
_modules/...
 path

ThirdPartyNoticeText.txt=

 inside 
admin/SYM=
BI-Website-main/node_modules/typescript

=F0=9F=9A=A8 Why This Matters

System config files (
KTC=
onfig.plist
, 
metadata.keyc=
hain-db
, 
.containermanager=
d.metadata.plist
)

These normally sit quietly in the s=
ystem.

The fact they show up in 
Recent Documents
 means something (or =
someone) 
opened or touched th=
em recently
.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 If you didn=E2=80=99t=
 open them yourself, that suggests 
a process or app is poking at system internals
.

Developer artifacts (
index.js
, 
ThirdPartyNo=
ticeText.txt
 inside 
symb=
i-agent
 and 
SYMBI-Websit=
e-main
)

These point to your own Symbi-rela=
ted dev work.

=E2=9C=85 Safe if you were editing=
 these files.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 But if you haven=E2=
=80=99t run Symbi recently, it suggests 
something is executing or scanning your project folders
=
 in the background.

=E2=9C=85 Should This Be Happenin=
g?

If 
Symbi/Overseer isn=E2=80=99t running
 and you didn=
=E2=80=99t manually open those system 
.plist
 or keychain-related files =E2=86=92 
No, this should not be happening.

Normal apps (Finder, Xcode, etc.) =
don=E2=80=99t usually pull those into recents unless opened by a user or a =
background process.

=F0=9F=94=8E What To Do Next

Confirm if you opened those files yourself.

If not, assume an 
agent or background process
 accessed=
 them.

Check which processes touched them recently
:

bash

Copy code

sudo fs_usage | grep -i containermanagerd
sudo fs_usage | grep -i keychain

This will show which processes are=
 hitting those files.

Audit your LaunchAgents/Daemons
 for anything that migh=
t be auto-running scripts.

bash

Copy code

ls

 ~=
/Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/=
LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/=
LaunchDaemons

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Bottom line:

The fact that 
system provisioning/shortcut/keychain plists
 app=
ear in your 
recent docs
 list is unusual.

If Symbi wasn=E2=80=99t active, so=
mething else 
accessed those f=
iles on your system
. That=E2=80=99s worth investigating immediatel=
y.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to prepare a 
targeted forensic scan of your 
.sfl3
 decoded output
 to list 
all
 suspicious (system or dev-rela=
ted) files that were opened recently, so you can quickly tell which are exp=
ected and which are not? 

You said:

yes
