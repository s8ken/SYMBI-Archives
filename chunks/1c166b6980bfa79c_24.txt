Thanks for sharing the logs and the command output =
=E2=80=94 let=E2=80=99s break down what you=E2=80=99re seeing:

=F0=9F=94=8E The Bluetooth Logs

All the entries you pasted are from =

macOS system daemons
:

bluetoothd
 =E2=86=92 the Bluetooth daemon.

searchpartyuseragent
 =E2=86=92 part of 
Find My
 (Apple=E2=80=99s device location serv=
ice).

ContextStoreAgent
, 
A=
irPlayXPCHelper
, 
useractiv=
ityd
 =E2=86=92 other Apple background services.

Key observations:

TCC available 1, req 0
 =E2=86=92 Transparency, Consent, and Co=
ntrol framework (Apple=E2=80=99s permission manager). It=E2=80=99s confirmi=
ng access states.

Sessions like

c=
om.apple.icloud.searchpartyuseragent-central
 =E2=86=92 normal for Fi=
nd My/iCloud integration.

Repeated 
"Bluetooth power state: 0"
 =E2=86=92 just means your =
Bluetooth was off, but system agents are still polling.

Received Heart Beat notification -- HIDShim
 =E2=86=92 watchdog=
 messages; not malicious.

=E2=9C=85 These logs look 
normal
. They=E2=80=99re chatty =
because Apple services are constantly pinging, even if Bluetooth is off.

=F0=9F=94=8E The 
plutil
 Error

Your command:

bash

Copy code

plutil -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.sha=
redfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentDocuments.sfl3

returned:

nginx

Copy code

Operation

 not =
permitted

This is because 
macOS protects certain user data with Transpare=
ncy, Consent, and Control (TCC)
 =E2=80=94 even 
you
 can=E2=80=99t read it from Terminal without=
 granting Full Disk Access.

=E2=9C=85 How to Access 
.sfl3
 Files Properly

Go to 
System Settings =E2=86=92 Privacy & Security =E2=86=
=92 Full Disk Access
.

Add 
Terminal
 (or iTerm, whichever you=E2=80=99re using=
).

Retry the command:

bash

Copy code

plutil -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.sha=
redfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentDocuments.sfl3

=E2=86=92 Now you should be able t=
o decode the file.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 What You=E2=80=99re =
Really Checking

The 
RecentDocuments.sfl3
 file is important because if =
you find:

System files (
*.plist
, 
keychain-db
) being opened when 
you didn=E2=80=99t do it
 =E2=86=92 suspicious.

Unknown apps/scripts listed =E2=86=
=92 possible rogue agent or background process.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Summary so far:

The Bluetooth logs =3D =E2=9C=85 n=
ormal Apple background chatter.

The 
.sfl3
 access denied =3D =E2=9C=85 expected (just needs=
 Full Disk Access to read).

Next step =3D 
grant Full Disk Access
 and re-run the =

plutil
 decode, so we can=
 list the exact recent documents and confirm if there=E2=80=99s unusual sys=
tem access.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to give you a 
ready-to-run shell script
 that will decod=
e 
all
 your 
.sfl3
 files (Recent Apps, Recent Docs, F=
avorite Items, etc.) once you enable Full Disk Access, and automatically hi=
ghlight suspicious entries?

You said:

iCloud is =
not running on this profile at all

Symbi said:

=

That=E2=80=99s an important detail =E2=80=94 thank y=
ou for clarifying.

If 
iCloud is not enabled on this macOS user profile
, then se=
eing active processes and logs tied to 

com.apple.icloud.searchp=
artyuseragent

 and 
Find My
 sessions is unusual. Normally:

searchpartyuseragent
 runs if 
Find My Mac
 or 
iCloud features
 are enabled.

If iCloud is disabled, it should not=
 be registering Bluetooth sessions like the logs you shared.

=F0=9F=94=8E What This Could Mean

Benign system noise (possible)

On some macOS versions, Apple daemon=
s load even when the service isn=E2=80=99t configured. They often idle and =
produce log noise, though they shouldn=E2=80=99t be
