Residual configuration

If this profile had iCloud enabled i=
n the past, some daemons (like 
se=
archpartyuseragent
) may still auto-load until purged.

Suspicious

If you 
never enabled iCloud
 on this profile and are seeing 
searchpartyuseragent
 creating se=
ssions, it suggests a 
misconf=
iguration or persistence vector
 =E2=80=94 something could be start=
ing iCloud services in the background against your profile settings.

=E2=9C=85 What You Can Check

1. See if the agent is listed in =
LaunchAgents/Daemons

Run:

bash

Copy code

launchctl list | grep searchpartyuseragent
launchctl 

print

 system | grep searchparty

If it=E2=80=99s there, check what=
=E2=80=99s loading it:

bash

Copy code

grep -r 

"sear=
chpartyuseragent"

 /System/Library/Launch* /Library/Laun=
ch* ~/Library/Launch*

2. Verify iCloud really is off

Go to 
System Settings =E2=86=92 Apple ID
. Confirm iClo=
ud is fully signed out.

Check if 
Find My Mac
 is disabled in 
System Settings =E2=86=92 General =E2=86=92 Sharing=
 =E2=86=92 Find My Mac
.

3. Monitor live activity

To see if it=E2=80=99s phoning hom=
e:

bash

Copy code

sudo lsof -i | grep searchparty
netstat -an | grep 5223

(
5223
 is Apple=E2=80=99s push service port; if it=E2=80=99=
s connecting without iCloud signed in, that=E2=80=99s a red flag.)

=F0=9F=9A=A8 Red Flag

If iCloud is 
off
 but the logs show:

Active Bluetooth pairing/advertisi=
ng sessions (
com.apple.icloud.s=
earchpartyuseragent-central
),

And it=E2=80=99s registering with =

bluetoothd
,

=E2=80=A6then either:

The daemon is being triggered by s=
omething else in your system, or

A rogue process is impersonating/l=
everaging 
searchpartyuseragent
 for persistence.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Bottom line:

This should 
not
 be h=
appening if iCloud is disabled on the profile. It=E2=80=99s worth investiga=
ting with 
launchctl
 to c=
onfirm whether this agent is being explicitly started, and 
lsof/netstat
 to confirm if it=E2=80=99s =
making network calls.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to bui=
ld you a 
single script
 that will:

List if 
searchpartyuseragent
 is running.

Show what launched it.

Show if it=E2=80=99s making outbou=
nd connections.

That way you can confirm if this is just Apple noise, or someth=
ing actively hijacking iCloud daemons.

 you can paste into Terminal. It will check whether 
searchpartyuseragent
 (the i=

s making network connections.
