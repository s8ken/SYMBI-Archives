arch Party
 daemons.

They=E2=80=99re all active under you=
r launch services =E2=80=94 meaning the system is starting them whether you=
 want it or not.

3. Network connection established

b=
ash

Copy code

tcp4 192.168.68.101.58284 =E2=86=92 17.57.145.38.5223 E=
STABLISHED

That IP (
17.57.145.38
) belongs to 
Apple
.

Port 
5223
 =3D Apple Push Service.

=E2=9C=85 So the agent is actively =
talking to Apple servers =E2=80=94 even though iCloud is off.

4. System log shows violations

log

Copy code

kernel: (Sandbox) System Policy: findmydeviced(216) deny(1) fi=
le-read-data /private/var/db/searchparty/sharedVault/agents/.../savedConfig=
uration.plist

This is 
macOS sandbox blocking

findmydeviced
 from reading a file it wanted.

That means the daemon is 
trying to operate but hitting security=
 restrictions
.

Normally, if Find My is disabled, =
this shouldn=E2=80=99t even be happening.

=F0=9F=9A=A8 Interpretation

Expected:
 If iCloud/Find My Mac is on =E2=86=92 these =
agents run, connect to Apple, manage Bluetooth beacons, and maintain =E2=80=
=9Csearch party=E2=80=9D functionality.

Not Expected:
 If iCloud is fully disabled, these proce=
sses should not be registering sessions or opening connections.

The fact that:

They=E2=80=99re running under 
launchctl
,

They=E2=80=99re connecting out to =
Apple,

They=E2=80=99re trying (and failin=
g) to read Find My configuration,

=E2=80=A6 strongly suggests either=
:

Residual configuration
: This Mac previously had iCloud=
/Find My enabled, and the agents are stuck running.

Persistence mechanism
: Something is forcing iCloud age=
nts to run as cover.

=E2=9C=85 What To Do Next

Step 1 =E2=80=94 Verify iCloud re=
ally is off

Go to 
System Settings =E2=86=92 Apple ID
. Make sure yo=
u=E2=80=99re fully signed out.

In 
System Settings =E2=86=92 General =E2=86=92 Sharing
=
, check if 
Find My Mac
 is off.

Step 2 =E2=80=94 Check for launch=
 configs

Search if these are explicitly loa=
ded by LaunchDaemons:

bash

Copy code

grep -r 

"sear=
chparty"

 /System/Library/Launch* /Library/Launch* ~/Lib=
rary/LaunchAgents ~/Library/LaunchDaemons 2>/dev/null

If you see a 
.plist
 specifically loading 
searchpartyuseragent
 or 
findmydeviced
 =E2=86=92 that=E2=80=99s w=
hy it=E2=80=99s still running.

Step 3 =E2=80=94 Try unloading ma=
nually

If iCloud is off and you don=E2=80=
=99t want these agents:

bash

Copy code

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAg=
ents/com.apple.icloud.searchpartyuseragent.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.iclou=
d.searchpartyd.plist

(You may need to adjust the exact =
plist names you find in Step 2.)

Step 4 =E2=80=94 Monitor

Run:

bash

Copy code

ps aux | grep -i searchparty
netstat -an | grep 5223

to confirm they stay down.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Bottom line:

Your Mac is running iCloud 
Find My daemons
 and connect=
ing to Apple Push even though you=E2=80=99re not signed into iCloud.

That is 
not normal
 unless there=E2=80=99s a leftover c=
onfig or a persistence trick.

If you don=E2=80=99t need them, th=
ey can be unloaded safely once confirmed via LaunchDaemons.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to wri=
te you a 
hardened cleanup scr=
ipt
 that will:

Stop all running 
searchparty*
 processes.

Disable their LaunchDaemons.

Log whether=
 they try to respawn (which would indicate persistence)?

You said:

its off never signedin

=

Symbi sa=
id:

That=E2=80=99s a critical=
 finding.

If you=E2=80=99ve 
never signed in=
 to iCloud on this profile
, then 
searchpartyuseragent
, 
findmydeviced
, and related daemons 
should not be running or connecting out
.

=F0=9F=9A=A8 What This Implies

macOS does ship these daemons by def=
ault, but 
they normally idle
 unless iCloud/Find My is enabled.

In your case:

They are 
actively running
.

They are 
making outbound connections
 to Apple servers (
17.57.145.38:5223
).

They are 
attempting file reads
 in 
/private/var/db/searchparty/...
.
