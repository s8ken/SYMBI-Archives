his means something is:

Explicitly 
starting iCloud/Find My services
 despite your p=
rofile being unsigned.

Using them as a 
persistence channel
 (cover traffic via l=
egitimate Apple processes).

That=E2=80=99s not baseline macOS be=
havior if you=E2=80=99ve never signed into iCloud.

=E2=9C=85 Next Actions

1. Confirm what=E2=80=99s loading t=
hem

Run:

=
bash

Copy code

grep -r 

"searc=
hparty"

 /System/Library/Launch* /Library/Launch* ~/Libr=
ary/LaunchAgents ~/Library/LaunchDaemons 2>/dev/null

This will tell you which plist(s) =
are forcing them to load.

2. Quarantine the daemons (if you=
 don=E2=80=99t need them)

You can unload them:

bash

Copy code

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAg=
ents/com.apple.icloud.searchpartyuseragent.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.iclou=
d.searchpartyd.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.findm=
ydeviced.plist

3. Monitor for respawn

Check every minute for 5=E2=80=931=
0 mins:

bash

Copy code

ps aux | grep -i searchparty
netstat -an | grep 5223

=E2=9C=85 If they stay down =E2=86=
=92 they were just misconfigured.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 If they restart autom=
atically =E2=86=92 persistence mechanism is forcing them back.

4. Deep check for persistence

Look in:

bash

Copy code

ls

 ~=
/Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/=
LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/=
LaunchDaemons

Any unfamiliar 
.plist
 there could be 
a trigger
 for these daemons.

5. Hardening step

If they keep coming back even afte=
r 
bootout
 and no plist i=
s present:

That points to 
tampering
 with 
launchd
 or hidden config.

At that stage, a 
clean macOS reinstall
 (erase + reinst=
all) is the most reliable remediation.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Bottom line:

If iCloud has 
never
 been used on this profile, these daemons 
should not be alive and talkin=
g to Apple servers
.

The most likely explanations are e=
ither:

A misconfigured base install of ma=
cOS (rare, but possible).

A persistence method piggybacking =
on Apple=E2=80=99s iCloud daemons.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to generate a 
removal + monitoring script
 that will (a)=
 kill these daemons, (b) disable their launch plists, and (c) log whether t=
hey try to relaunch =E2=80=94 so you=E2=80=99ll know immediately if it=E2=
=80=99s persistence?
