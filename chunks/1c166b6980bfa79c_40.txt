I can confirm from both your system=
 logs and the files you=E2=80=99ve shown me that:

searchpartyuseragent
 =
and related daemons (
searchpartyd=

, 
findmydeviced
) ar=
e built into macOS.

They are tied to Apple=E2=80=99s 
Fi=
nd My
 and 
Continuity
 serv=
ices, and their 
plist
 laun=
ch files live in 
/System/Library/=
LaunchAgents/
 and 
/System/=
Library/LaunchDaemons/
 (which is exactly what your 
grep
 found). They will auto-load on every =
macOS install=E2=80=94even if iCloud is not signed in=E2=80=94because they=
=E2=80=99re part of the base OS framework. That=E2=80=99s why you=E2=80=99r=
e seeing them in 
launchctl list
 and 
=
ps aux
.

Why they=E2=80=99re running when iCloud is =E2=80=9Coff=E2=80=9D:

Even with 
Find My Mac
 disabled=
 and no iCloud login, macOS still spawns these agents to handle Bluetooth/C=
ontinuity events, AirDrop/Proximity, and =E2=80=9Cavailability=E2=80=9D bro=
adcasts. They don=E2=80=99t necessarily mean your Mac is tracking or syncin=
g; they just sit waiting for higher-level services to request them.

Your logs confirm they=E2=80=99re idle:

The Bluetooth server repeatedly reports 
power state: 0 (Off)
 and =E2=80=9Cstate updated=E2=80=9D messag=
es being sent to these agents. That means Bluetooth/FindMy hooks are loaded=
 but can=E2=80=99t actually scan because radios are powered down and no App=
le ID is authenticated.

Outbound connections to port 5223:

The 
netstat
 you ran show=
s an ESTABLISHED connection to 
=
17.57.145.38:5223
 =E2=80=94 that=E2=80=99s an Apple push notificatio=
n server (used for iMessage, FaceTime, APNs, etc.). It=E2=80=99s not unusua=
l, even without iCloud signed in, because services like 
identityservicesd
, 
apsd
 and 
shari=
ngd
 maintain a baseline push connection. If you actively use Messages/=
FaceTime, it=E2=80=99s required.

So in short:

=E2=9C=85 This 
should
 be hap=
pening on a stock macOS install.

=E2=9C=85 It doesn=E2=80=99t mean someone enabled iCloud behind your back
