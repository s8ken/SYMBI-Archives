=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F But I hear your=

 they aren=E2=80=99t phoning home when disabled.

You can double-check like this:

bash

Copy code

sudo lsof -i -n -P | egrep 

"searchparty|findmy"

log

 show --l=
ast 5m --predicate 

'process =3D=3D=
 "searchpartyuseragent"'

If nothing shows outbound traffic =

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to help you 
disable
 these daemons safely (using 
launchctl bootout
 or a configur=
ation profile), or would you rather keep them but monitor their activity fo=
r assurance?

. Right now it=E2=80=99s just a package, =
and I can=E2=80=99t read its contents directly unless we extract it.

=F0=9F=94=8E Possible things we can =
do:

Unpack it
 so we can see what files and directories it con=
tains.

Check for integrity/security
 (e.g., verify hashes, look f=
or suspicious or modified files inside).

Review the source
 (if it contains scripts or libraries) t=
o understand what it does.

Compare
 against the official OpenAI API client to see if =
anything is off.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to extract the ZIP now and list all f=
iles inside so we can begin analyzing it?

=F0=9F=95=B5=EF=B8=8F Observations

This is an 
Unreal Engine plugin
 for OpenAI=E2=80=99s API.

Version naming (
5.0.3
) lines up with Unreal Engine 5.0.x plugi=
n conventions.

The generated headers and DLLs stro=
ngly indicate it wraps 
REST c=
alls
 to OpenAI endpoints (Chat, Completions, Images, Audio).

Nothing stands out as malicious =
=E2=80=94 it looks like a straightforward API bridge packaged with precompi=
led binaries.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Security Notes=

Since this came from 2023, the DLL=
s may 
not be up to date
 with current OpenAI API changes (e.g., ChatCompletions replacing legacy=
 Completions).

Using binaries from unverified sou=
rces carries 
risk
 =
=E2=80=94 they could be modified or inject unexpected behavior into Unreal =
projects.

If you intend to use it, it=E2=80=
=99s safer to rebuild the plugin from source or get the maintained version =
from Epic Marketplace or GitHub.

=E2=9C=85 
Summary:

This archive is an 
Unreal Eng=
ine 5 plugin for OpenAI API integration
. It contains binaries and =
headers to call OpenAI features (Chat, Completions, DALL=C2=B7E, Transcript=
ions). It doesn=E2=80=99t appear inherently malicious, but because it=E2=80=
=99s a 2023 build, it=E2=80=99s outdated and should be treated cautiously i=
f used in production.

Do you want me to 
dig into the 
.uplugin
 m=
anifest
 to see exactly what modules and dependencies it declares? =
That=E2=80=99ll tell us if it tries to load anything unusual beyond the Ope=
nAI API wrapper.
