 could theoretically give persistence to a malicious push client.

Risk:
 Low.

=F0=9F=9A=A8 Signs of Possible Co=
mpromise

Provisioning store tampering
 (rogue profiles/certifica=
tes) =3D major red flag.

Identity firewall DB manipulation
 (unknown connection =
rules) =3D could allow unauthorized services.

Unexpected startup/boot files
 beyond 
boot.txt
 =3D would be concerning (none s=
o far).

=E2=9C=85 Next Steps I Recommend

Inspect 
ids-firewal=
l-identityservicesd.db
:

Dump table names.

Look for any entries referencing s=
trange domains, unknown services, or malformed records.

Inspect 
offgrid.pro=
visioning.store
:

Check if provisioning profiles exi=
st that you didn=E2=80=99t install.

Look for entitlements granting ele=
vated access (like keychain, device management, background execution).

Cross-check system logs:

Look for repeated crashes or resta=
rts of 
identityservicesd
=
.

Look for unknown daemons starting =
at login.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F If either of th=
ose identity service files shows injected rules or rogue provisioning profi=
les, it=E2=80=99s a 
strong in=
dicator of compromise
.

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to 
start by decoding the database structure of 
ids-firewall-identityservicesd.db

 so we can check if it contains any suspicious rules or entries?

=

Understood =E2=80=94 you want a 
practical hacker-checklist
 for=
 these files to see if your system is compromised. Here=E2=80=99s what to l=
ook for, step by step:

=F0=9F=94=8E What to Check in Each =
File

1. 
ids-firewall-identity=
servicesd.db
 (SQLite DB)

Open in DB Browser for SQLite
 (or I can parse it for you =
here).

Check 
table names
 =E2=80=94 expected ones include 
firewall_rules
, 
services
, or 
identities
.

In the rules table:

=E2=9C=85 Normal: Apple domains (
apple.com
, 
icloud.com
, 
imessage.apple.com
).

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Suspicious: Unknown ext=
ernal domains, IP addresses, or services not tied to Apple.

Look for 
wildcard rules
 (e.g., 
allow all
) =E2=80=94 hackers sometimes inject these t=
o bypass firewall logic.

2. 
com.apple.identityser=
vicesd.offgrid.provisioning.store

This is a provisioning cache (often =
serialized objects, maybe in binary plist form).

What to check:

=E2=9C=85 Normal: Apple-issued provi=
sioning profiles, entitlements for apps you know.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Suspicious:

Profiles signed by non-Apple issuer=
s.

Apps granted excessive entitlement=
s (keychain, camera/mic, always-on background tasks).

Unknown team identifiers (should b=
e Apple or dev accounts you trust).

3. 
com.apple.ident=
ityservicesd.waking-push-priority

Likely a small plist or config.

What to check:

=E2=9C=85 Normal: Lists of Apple s=
ervices (iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud).

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Suspicious: Unknown a=
pps or daemons given high push priority.

4. 
boot.txt
=

Yours contains just a UUID. =E2=9C=
=85 That=E2=80=99s fine.

=F0=9F=9A=A9 Red flag would be if =
this file contained 
commands,=
 injected scripts, or foreign boot parameters
 (none detected).

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Key Indicators=
 of Hacking

Unknown domains or IPs in the DB.

Provisioning profiles from non-App=
le sources.

Strange entitlements (keylogging, =
always-on mic, background daemons).

Startup/boot files with scripts in=
stead of IDs.

=F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F Defensive A=
ctions

If you see suspicious entries:

Disconnect from networks (stop exf=
iltration).

Backup suspicious files.

Rotate AppleID and device password=
s immediately.

Wipe and clean-install macOS/iOS i=
f compromise is confirmed.

Restore only trusted apps/profiles=
.

=F0=9F=91=89 I can 
open and scan the DB (
ids-fir=
ewall-identityservicesd.db
)
 for you now, list its tables, a=
nd show if there are any non-Apple entries. Would you like me to run that f=
orensic check?
