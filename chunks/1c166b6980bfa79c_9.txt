Sample Data

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F No rows were retu=
rned (the table is 
empty
).

This means 
your identity firewall has no custom rules logged
 =E2=80=94 only the structure is present.

Security Assessment

=E2=9C=85 
Good news:
 No suspicious or injected firewall =
rules found.

=E2=9C=85 No evidence of hacked en=
tries (like strange domains or services).

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F If it stays emp=
ty, the firewall is essentially relying on Apple defaults =E2=80=94 fine in=
 most cases, but it means there=E2=80=99s no additional custom protection a=
t this layer.

=F0=9F=91=89 Next logical step: ch=
eck 

offgrid.provisioning.store

, since 
provisioning profiles
 are =
a common hacking vector (rogue certs, entitlements).

Would you like me to 
decode and inspect 
com.appl=
e.identityservicesd.offgrid.provisioning.store

 next, to see=
 if any suspicious profiles or entitlements are inside?

yes

The file 

com.apple.identityservicesd=
.offgrid.provisioning.store

 is 
not a standard plist
 =E2=80=94 it failed parsing as =
XML/binary property list.

Instead, it=E2=80=99s a 
binary blob
 (the raw sample shows =
non-printable bytes, likely a serialized object or encrypted/protected prov=
isioning store).

=F0=9F=94=8E What This Means

This file likely contains 
provisioning profiles, tokens, or entitle=
ment data
 in a compact, possibly encrypted/serialized form.

It=E2=80=99s not human-readable with=
out decoding Apple=E2=80=99s serialization format.

This is normal for a provisioning ca=
che =E2=80=94 Apple encrypts or binary-encodes sensitive provisioning info.=

=F0=9F=9A=A8 Hack Check

What to look for if compromised:

Rogue provisioning profiles
 =E2=86=92 allowing unknown ap=
ps/services.

Fake certificates
 =E2=86=92 not signed by Apple.

Excess entitlements
 =E2=86=92 like unrestricted keychain =
access, background execution, or device management rights.

Since it=E2=80=99s binary, we=E2=80=
=99ll need to 
extract strings
 and scan for suspicious entries (domains, team IDs, cert names).

=F0=9F=91=89 Do you want me to run a 
deep string extraction + keyword scan
 (e.g., =
=E2=80=9CApple=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CTeamID=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CCert=E2=80=9D, =
domains, suspicious patterns) across this file to check if anything unusual=
 or malicious is embedded? 

You said:

yes and then tell me what to check

Symbi said:

Here=E2=80=99s what I found after scanning 

com.apple.identityservicesd.offgrid.provisioning.store

:

=F0=9F=94=8D String Extraction Resu=
lts

Only 
8 total ASCII strings
 detected in the entire binary.

None matched keywords like 
apple
, 
cert
, 
team
, 
entitlement
, 
profile
, 
https
, or 
key
.

In other words: 
no readable certificate names, domains, or entitl=
ements
 are present in clear text.

=F0=9F=93=8C What That Implies

The file is almost entirely 
binary/serialized
 =E2=80=94 li=
kely encrypted or obfuscated by Apple.

This is 
normal
 for a provisioning cache: it protects sensi=
tive keys and tokens.

No evidence of 
rogue certificates
 or 
injected profiles
 visible in plaintext.

=E2=9C=85 What You Should Check (fo=
r hacking concerns)

Since we can=E2=80=99t read it fully=
 without Apple=E2=80=99s internal format, here=E2=80=99s what you (or a for=
ensic analyst) should do:

Check signatures of provisioning profiles
 (if extracted):=
