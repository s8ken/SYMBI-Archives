 "Governance-Only" Protects Your Positioning

**U.S. SEC Howey Test:**
- =E2=9D=8C Investment of money =E2=86=92 No (tokens earned, not purchased)
- =E2=9D=8C Common enterprise =E2=86=92 No (open-source protocol)
- =E2=9D=8C Expectation of profit =E2=86=92 No (explicitly governance-only)
- =E2=9D=8C Efforts of others =E2=86=92 No (self-custody, direct voting)

**Result:** Not a security (if done correctly)

**Australia (ASIC):**
- Governance-only tokens generally not "financial products"
- Must avoid language suggesting profit or investment
- Disclosure requirements for any transferability

**EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets):**
- Governance tokens may be exempt if no economic rights
- Must document "no profit expectation" clearly
- Transparency requirements align with Dune dashboard approach

### Recommended Legal Disclosures

**On every DAO page:**

IMPORTANT: SYMBI governance tokens hav=
e no financial value,
no expectation of profit, and grant no economic rights.
Tokens are non-transferable and used solely for protocol
governance voting. You do not need tokens to use SYMBI
Trust Protocol or Sonate Platform.

## FAQ Integration

### Questions Enterprise Buyers Will Ask

**Q: "Do I need DAO tokens to use SYMBI Trust Protocol?"**
A: No. SYMBI Trust Protocol is open-source and available to everyone. DAO t=
okens are only for contributors who want to participate in protocol governa=
nce.

**Q: "Is this production-ready or still experimental?"**
A: The SYMBI Trust Protocol infrastructure is production-ready (DID resolut=
ion, revocation, KMS, audit logging). The DAO governance layer is launching=
 in pilot phase (October 2025) but doesn't affect protocol stability.

**Q: "What's the relationship between SYMBI, Sonate, and the DAO?"**
A:
- **SYMBI Trust Protocol** =3D Open standard (W3C DID/VC)
- **Sonate** =3D Enterprise platform built on SYMBI
- **SYMBI DAO** =3D Community governance of the protocol
- **SYMBI Foundation** =3D Academic stewardship (ARC Discovery)

**Q: "Is this a cryptocurrency project?"**
A: No. SYMBI DAO uses a governance-only token with no financial value. It's=
 a reputation system for protocol contributors, not a speculative asset.

**Q: "How does the DAO relate to compliance (EU AI Act)?"**
A: DAO governance is transparent and auditable (Dune dashboards), which sup=
ports compliance. The protocol's technical compliance features (DID/VC, aud=
it trails) are independent of DAO governance.

## Dune Dashboard Strategy

### Public Transparency Reinforces "Trust Infrastructure" Message

**Create Three Dashboard Views:**

#### 1. **Protocol Adoption Dashboard** (yseeku.com audience)
- DIDs resolved (by method: web, key, ethr, ion)
- Credentials issued
- Revocation checks
- Audit log entries verified
- Integration: "Vie
