### Signals That Cause Concern (Avoid These)

1. **"Token launch" or "TGE"** (Token Generation Event)

## Summary: DAO as Trust Protocol Validation

### The Strategic Narrative

"The SYMBI DAO isn't just governance=
=E2=80=94it's proof.

Proof that our trust infrastructure works in production.
Proof that decentralized identity scales.
Proof that cryptographic audit trails prevent tampering.
Proof that reputation can replace speculation.

We're not asking you to trust our claims.
We're showing you our governance running on our infrastructure.

Enterprise buyers: Use Sonate Platform (no tokens required)
Developers: Build on SYMBI Symphony (open-source, MIT/Apache)
Contributors: Shape the protocol via DAO (earned participation)

Three paths. One trust infrastructure. Zero speculation."
