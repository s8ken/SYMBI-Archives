 messaging, or you risk:

1. Confusing enterprise buyers ("Is this crypto?")
2. Triggering securities law concerns ("Are tokens investments?")
3. Diluting your technical positioning ("Just another DAO")

**The solution:**
- **yseeku.com** =3D Enterprise trust infrastructure (production-ready, no =
tokens)
- **gammatria.com** =3D Protocol governance + academic research (DAO for co=
ntributors)
- **Dune dashboards** =3D Public proof of both

**Tagline for DAO launch:**
> "Sovereignty through stewardship, verifiable through infrastructure."

This frames the DAO as a **demonstration of your trust protocol's capabilit=
ies**, not a separate crypto project.
