I am having microphone issues since we removed the mic capability yesterday 

ChatGPT said:

Got it. Since we removed microphone access for security reasons, let's go step by step to restore it securely.

Step 1: Check System Preferences for Mic Access

Go to
  
(Apple Menu) > System Settings

Select "Privacy & Security"
 on the left

Scroll down to "Microphone"

Make sure your apps (Zoom, FaceTime, etc.) have access enabled

If they are 
disabled
, toggle them back on.

Step 2: Check Audio Input Device

Go to
  
(Apple Menu) > System Settings > Sound

Under "Input," select the correct microphone

If using the 
MacBook's built-in mic
, select "Internal Microphone"

If using an 
external mic
, make sure it's connected and selected

Check the Input Level bar

If the bar moves
 when you speak, the mic is working

If not
, try increasing the Input Volume

Step 3: Reset Core Audio (if needed)

If the mic still isn’t working, reset the macOS audio system:

Open 
Terminal

Run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo killall coreaudiod

Enter your Mac password (it won’t show as you type)

Try using the mic again

Step 4: Test the Microphone

Open 
Voice Memos
 and record a quick test

If it works in 
Voice Memos
 but not in an app like 
Zoom
, check the app settings

Let me know how it goes!
