If 
Safari is not listed
 under 
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone
, follow these steps to force it to request access again:

Step 1: Clear Safari Website Data & Reset Permissions

Open Safari

Go to Safari > Settings (Cmd + ,)

Select the "Privacy" tab

Click 
"Manage Website Data"

Search for the site where the mic is needed (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet)

Select it and click 
"Remove"

Click 
Done

Now Safari should re-prompt for microphone access when you visit the site again.

Step 2: Manually Reset Safari Permissions

Go to Safari > Settings

Click the "Websites" tab

On the left, select "Microphone"

At the bottom, set 
"When visiting other websites"
 to 
"Ask"

Step 3: Force Safari to Request Microphone Access

Open a site that requires the microphone, such as:

Google Meet

Zoom Web

Any online voice recorder (e.g., 
this one

)

Start a call or recording—Safari should now 
prompt you to allow microphone access

Click "Allow"
 when prompted

Step 4: Restart Safari & Recheck System Settings

Quit Safari
 (
Cmd + Q
)

Reopen System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone

See if 
Safari is now listed
—if so, toggle it ON

Let me know if Safari still doesn’t appear! 🚀
