macOS Date Command Error

Sh=
are

SA

what does this mean? guest1@SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro ~ =
% date and time
date: illegal time format
usage: date [-jnRu] [-I[date|hours|minutes|seconds|ns]] [-f input_fmt]
            [ -z output_zone ] [-r filename|s=
econds] [-v[+|-]val[y|m|w|d|H|M|S]]
            [[[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.SS] | ne=
w_date] [+output_fmt]
guest1@SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro ~ %

This is a command line error =
message from macOS/Unix. Here's what happened:

The u=
ser typed 
date and time
 in the terminal, but the 
date
 command doesn't und=
erstand "and time" as a valid parameter. The 
date
 command interpreted "and=
" and "time" as arguments it was supposed to process, which caused it to fa=
il.

The e=
rror message shows:

date: illegal time format
 - th=
e command couldn't parse "and time" as a valid time format

Then it displays the usage synt=
ax showing all the valid options for the 
date
 command

To fi=
x this, the user should have just typed:

ba=
sh

date

``

`

This=
 would display the current 

date

 and time, like:

`

``

Sat Aug  

2

14

:30:25 PDT 

2025

The 
date
 command by itself already shows both date and time - there's no need t=
o add "and time" after it.

SA

guest1@SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro=
 ~ % date
Sat  2 Aug 2025 04:47:20 AEST
guest1@SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro ~ % time
shell  0.02s user 0.03s system 0% cpu 5:10.88 total
children  0.04s user 0.07s system 0% cpu 5:10.88 total
guest1@SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro ~ %

Perfect! Now you can see the =
difference between the two commands:

dat=
e

 - Shows the current date and time:

Sat 2 Aug 2025 04:47:20 AEST
 (=
Saturday, August 2nd, 2025 at 4:47 AM Australian Eastern Standard Time)

tim=
e

 - Shows execution time statistics for the current shell s=
ession:

shell 0.02s user 0.03s system
 =
- Time spent by the shell itself

children 0.04s user 0.07s system
 - Time spent by child processes

5:10.88 total
 - Total elapsed =
time since the shell started (5 minutes, 10.88 seconds)

So wh=
en you originally typed 
date and time
, the system tried to interpret "and =
time" as parameters for the 
date
 command, which failed. The 
time
 command =
is actually a separate utility that measures command execution time - it's =
not meant to display the current time like 
date
 does.

If yo=
u want both date/time info and timing statistics, you'd run them as separat=
e commands (which you just did!).

SA

how do I just get time

To get just the time (without=
 the date), you can use the 
date
 command with formatting options:

ba=
sh

date

 +%T

This =
will show just the time in HH:MM:SS format, like: 
04:47:20

Or fo=
r a 12-hour format with AM/PM:

ba=
sh

date

 +%r

This =
will show: 
04:47:20 AM

Other=
 useful time-only formats:

date +%H:%M
 - Hours and minute=
s only (24-hour): 
04:47

date +%I:%M %p
 - Hours and min=
utes with AM/PM: 
04:47 AM

The 
+%
