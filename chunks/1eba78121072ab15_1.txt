ells the 
date
 command to use custom formatting, where:

%T
 =3D time in HH:MM:SS format=

%r
 =3D 12-hour time with AM/PM=

%H
 =3D hour (24-hour)

%I
 =3D hour (12-hour)

%M
 =3D minutes

%p
 =3D AM/PM

So 
date +%T=

 is probably what you're looking for to get just the current time.

SA

guest1@SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro=
 ~ % date +%T
04:48:21
guest1@SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro ~ %

Perfect! That's exactly what =
you wanted - just the current time in HH:MM:SS format: 
04:48:21
.

The 
date +%=
T
 command is a clean way to get only the time without all the extra =
date information that the plain 
date
 command shows.

what do you have for time=
 and date right now?

According to my system inform=
ation, the current date and time is Saturday, August 02, 2025. However, I d=
on't have access to real-time clock data, so I can't tell you the exact cur=
rent time down to the minute and second like your terminal can.

Your =
terminal showed 
04:48:21
 (4:48 AM) in AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Ti=
me), which makes sense since you're in Australia.

If yo=
u want to see what time it is right now, your 
date
 and 
date +%T
 commands =
will give you the most accurate, up-to-the-second information!

SA

as so This will show: 
04:47:20 =
AM was a guess?

Yes, exactly! That was my gue=
ss based on the time your terminal had shown earlier (
04:47:20
). I was dem=
onstrating what the 
date +%r
 command output would look like using your act=
ual time as an example, but I added the "AM" part as an assumption.

I don=
't actually know what your current time is - I was just showing you what th=
e format would look like. Your terminal commands are the real, live data, w=
hile my examples were just illustrations of the formatting options.

Thank=
s for catching that - it's a good reminder that when I show examples, I'm o=
ften using sample data rather than real-time information!

Zeitverschiebung

This =
25-hour difference might seem confusing because it's more than 24 hours! Th=
is happens because these two Pacific island locations are on opposite sides=
 of the International Date Line. So when it's, for example, 2:00 PM on Mond=
ay in Apia, it's actually 1:00 PM on Sunday (the previous day) in Alofi.

The l=
arge time difference exists because Samoa moved across the International Da=
te Line in 2011 to align better with Australia and New Zealand for business=
 purposes, while Niue remained on the other side of the date line.
