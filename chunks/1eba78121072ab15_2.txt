Samoa's move across =
the International Date Line in 2011 was quite remarkable! Here's what happe=
ned:

The Move:

On Thursday, December 29, 2011, Samoa moved to the Asian side of the Intern=
ational Date Line, and Thursday was followed by Saturday, December 31, 2011=

Zeitverschiebung

 - Friday, December 30, 2011, was compl=
etely erased from Samoa's calendar and never existed there 

Distance=

.

Why They Did It:

The move was economic - Samoa wanted to align themselves with their 21st ce=
ntury trading partners throughout the region, particularly to improve trade=
 and travel connections with New Zealand and Australia

Historical Context:

This was actually undoing a previous change. The time jump came 119 years a=
fter some U.S. traders had persuaded local Samoan authorities to align thei=
r islands' time with nearby U.S.-controlled American Samoa and the U.S. to =
assist their trading 

Time.is

. So from 1892 until the end of 2011, Samoa was on the sam=
e side of the date line as American Samoa

The Dramatic Change:

Until the end of 2011, Samoa used UTC=E2=88=9211:00, but after crossing the=
 date line it became UTC+13:00 

Happy Zebra

 - that's a 24-hour jump! Sirens wailed and fireworks e=
xploded as the nation celebrated this historic jump forward in time 

Distance Between

.

So Sa=
moa essentially chose to be closer in time to Australia and New Zealand (ma=
jor trading partners) rather than to the United States, making business muc=
h easier since they're no longer a full day behind those countries.
