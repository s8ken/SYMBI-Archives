GitHub Pages Documentation

Pastebin or Gist (for smaller data)

For moderate-sized files, use 
GitHub Gists

 or 
Pastebin

. These platforms provide plain-text hosting op=
timized for direct readability.

Static Web Hosting
 (Vercel, Netlify)

Host the files on Vercel or Netlif=
y as static assets. This makes each file directly accessible via a simple U=
RL.

Cloud Storage (Public Bucket)

AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or A=
zure Storage with public-read access and direct URLs. (Ensure public permis=
sions are clearly set.)

Common Pitfalls (Avoid these):

Large files (>50MB)
 are difficult for AI or indexin=
g tools to process. Consider splitting larger files into smaller chunks.

Complex folder structures
 without clear navigation/ind=
exing make files inaccessible to automated tools or crawlers.

Compressed archives (zip/tar.gz)
 are not readable dire=
ctly.

=E2=9C=85 
Recommended Setup (Best Practice)
:

To make your existing GitHub repo =
fully readable:

Convert conversations into multipl=
e smaller 
.txt
 or 
.md
 files (under 10MB each).

Include a clear 
README.md
 at the top level that links di=
rectly to each file, describing the content.

(Optional, but recommended) Enable=
 GitHub Pages on the repo, making files available as a navigable website.

You successfully installed 
@elizaos/cli
 but are encountering a path issue. To resolve:

Run this command to add Bun's global =
binary folder to your path:

b=
ash

Copy code

export

 PATH=3D

"/Users/admin/.bun/bin:
$PATH

"

Then verify by running:

b=
ash

Copy code

elizaos create SYMBI

To persist the change, add the export command to your 
~/.bash_profile
