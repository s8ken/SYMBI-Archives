Thanks =E2=80=94 that output confirms it: 
Playwright isn't fully installed yet
, and that'=
s why ElizaOS is still throwing browser errors.

Let=E2=80=99s fix it cleanly.

=E2=9C=85 Final Fix =E2=80=94 Run T=
hese in Order:

Install Playwright

b=
ash

Copy code

npm install @playwright/test --save-dev

Install Chromium

b=
ash

Copy code

npx playwright install chromium

This will properly download the need=
ed binary to the expected path.

(Optional but Safe) 
Restart ElizaOS

b=
ash

Copy code

cd

 sy=
mbi
elizaos dev

=F0=9F=A7=BC OR Disable the Plugin

If you 
don=E2=80=99t need the browser plugin now
, disable =

@elizaos/plugin-browser
 in=
 the Plugins tab to silence the errors entirely.

Once you=E2=80=99ve done either of these, we=E2=80=99ll retest th=
e GitHub integration. You=E2=80=99re very close now!
