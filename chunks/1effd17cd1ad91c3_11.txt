Thanks for posting =
the logs =E2=80=94 you're in excellent shape except for 
one small final issue
:

=E2=9D=8C Error: 
Port 3000 is already in use

This just means something (probably =
another ElizaOS or dev server) is still running in the background on port 
3000
.

=E2=9C=85 Fix It:

Option 1: Kill whatever=E2=80=99s u=
sing port 3000

Run this in your terminal:

b=
ash

Copy code

lsof -i :3000

That=E2=80=99ll show you the process=
 using port 3000 (e.g., Node, Bun, etc.). Then:

b=
ash

Copy code

kill

 =
-9 <PID>

Replace 
<PID>
 with the actual process ID from the above.=

Option 2: Start ElizaOS on a differ=
ent port

If you want to run multiple agents o=
r projects at once:

b=
ash

Copy code

elizaos dev --port 3001

(Or any other available port.)

Once it boots without errors, open y=
our browser to 
http://localhost:3=
001
 (or whichever port you chose), and you=E2=80=99ll be right back =
in business.

Let me know which way you go and I=E2=80=99ll help verify it=E2=
=80=99s working!
