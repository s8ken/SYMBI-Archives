That will stop the Playwright-relate=
d startup errors entirely =E2=80=94 and your agent will still work great wi=
th GitHub, shell, and OpenAI.

Once you've picked a path (install or disable), let me know =E2=
=80=94 then we test GitHub again!

You now have the correct Chromium bina=

ElizaOS was previously expecting:

=F0=9F=94=A7 Final Step: Restart El=

Let=E2=80=99s restart your agent now=
 to ensure it picks up the installed browser:

b=

Copy code

cd

elizaos dev

That Playwright browser error should=
 now be gone =F0=9F=8E=89

Once it boots cleanly, head back to 
localhost:3000
 and give your 
GitHub agent
 command a test again, like:

List all my public GitHub repos.

or

Let me know what happens!

is it because chrome only finished installing after we installed chromiu=

ChatGPT said:

Exactly =E2=
=80=94 you nailed it. =F0=9F=92=A1

The issue was that 
ElizaOS (via Playwright) expected a specific Chrom=
ium binary (
chromium_headless_she=
ll
)
, but that wasn't available when it first tried to start=
.

What happened:

You had Playwright installed =E2=80=
=94 =E2=9C=85

But 
no browsers
 were installed yet =E2=80=94 =E2=9D=8C

ElizaOS launched and couldn=E2=80=99=
t find the needed executable:

r=

Copy code

=

chromium_headless_shell

-

1155

 =E2=
=86=92 

missing

Once you ran:

b=
ash

Copy code

npx playwright install chromium

...Playwright downloaded all the act=
ual browser binaries (like 
chromi=
um-1181
), 
fixing the mis=
sing piece
.

Now that Chromium is installed corre=
ctly, any plugin that depends on browser automation (like 
@elizaos/plugin-browser
) should work as ex=
pected after a restart.

You're ready to roll. Want to test the agent one more time?

yeah but we might need to install again =
as I only just launched chrome for the first time after the install was com=
plete

ChatGPT said:

Yes =E2=80=
=94 if you 
launched Chrome manual=
ly for the first time just now
, macOS may have finished verifying =
or unquarantining the app 
after
 Playwright installed it. That could prevent the binary from being usable =
during the initial launch attempt by ElizaOS.

=E2=9C=85 Safe move now:

Run this again just to be 100% sure =
it's fully set up:

b=
ash

Copy code

npx playwright install chromium

This will re-verify and ensure the c=
orrect path and permissions are in place =E2=80=94 especially on macOS.

Then, restart ElizaOS:

b=
ash

Copy code

cd

 sy=
mbi
elizaos dev

Once that=E2=80=99s done and it launches cleanly =E2=80=94 no mor=
e browser plugin errors =E2=80=94 try your GitHub agent again. You're final=
ly clear for takeoff. =F0=9F=9B=AB
