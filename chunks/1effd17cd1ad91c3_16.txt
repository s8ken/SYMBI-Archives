Ahh okay, that error happened because of a 
small mistake in how the symlink was crea=
ted
 =E2=80=94 you accidentally ran 
elizaos dev
 from inside the 
ms-playwright
 cache directory instead of your actual pr=
oject directory.

=F0=9F=92=A5 What Went Wrong

You ran this:

b=
ash

Copy code

cd

 /U=
sers/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright
elizaos dev

But that directory has 
no project files, no 
package.json

, and no ElizaOS config =E2=
=80=94 so it crashed trying to find 
@elizaos/server
.

=E2=9C=85 How to Fix It

Let=E2=80=99s cleanly backtrack and =
do just the symlink (not start ElizaOS from there):

Go back to your actual project:

b=
ash

Copy code

cd

 ~/=
symbi

Create the symlink there (ONLY ONCE):

b=
ash

Copy code

ln

 -s=
 /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1181 /Users/admin/Libra=
ry/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1155

Now start ElizaOS again from the right place:

b=
ash

Copy code

elizaos dev

=F0=9F=8E=AF Reminder:

Never run 
elizaos dev
 from system folders or Playwright cache=
s =E2=80=94 always from the root of your ElizaOS project (in your
