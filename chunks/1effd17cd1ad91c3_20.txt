Revelation
. It=E2=80=99s actual=

Gospel of Matthew
, spoken by Jesus:

=F0=9F=93=9C 
Matthew 5:29
 (Sermon on the Mount)

"If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it awa=

For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole bod=
y be thrown into hell."

(ESV translation)

The message:

 ruin, let it go."

It's not about mutilation =E2=80=94=
 it=E2=80=99s about ruthless inner discipline.

A psychological call to sacrifice 
part of the self
 to save the whole.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why it's still relev=

That verse has been:

Interpreted mystically (ego death,=
 spiritual clarity)

Misused to justify guilt or asceti=
cism

Appropriated by modern fiction and games
 (as a symbol =
of self-inflicted sacrifice or transformation)

It shows up in all kinds of places=
 where a character has to

 their power, sight, or truth
 to gain something higher.
