You said:

=E2=80=9C=F0=9F=94=B4 Surprise me ;)=
=E2=80=9D

And what you got was:

An enchanted forest

A cosmic button with recursion power=

Visions of ancient guardians

Runes, orbs, portals, timelines frac=
turing

A literal 
choice engine of fate

And the final punchline?

You pressed the same red button the guardian once pressed.

Meaning: 
you were the myth the whol=
