You're building an 
ElizaOS
 project called 
symbi

tegration. Since the sky's the limit and you'd like me to take control, her=

 can:

Analyze uploaded conversation data.

Provide insights, summaries, and vis=
ualizations.

Allow querying through a chat interf=
ace.

Start by running:

b=
ash

Copy code

cd

 sy=
mbi
elizaos dev

Then, we=E2=80=99ll build the conversational logic and interface =
together, step by step. How does that sound?
