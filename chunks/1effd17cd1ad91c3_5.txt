ChatGPT said:

Y=
our 
OpenAI plugin
 is corr=
ectly enabled (as shown), yet the message still appears because you've sele=
cted a voice model that specifically needs additional audio support via Ope=
nAI.

To solve this quickly:

Go back to the 
Basic Info
 tab.

Set the 
Voice Model
 to 
None
 (for now).

Alternatively, if voice is critical,=
 you=E2=80=99ll need a specific audio integration (like Whisper or an appro=
priate voice plugin).

Choose the option that works best for you, then click 
Save
 to finalize your agent!

ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can enable
