so its not a client secret=

ChatGPT said:

Correct =E2=80=94 i=
t's not an 
OAuth client secret
, it's a 
Personal Access To=
ken (PAT)
.

=E2=9C=85 You're using:

A 
Personal Access Token (classic)
 =E2=80=94 used by your E=
lizaOS agent to authenticate 
as=
 you
, with direct repo access.

Use it if you want your assistant to=
:

Read/write to your repos

Analyze files or code

Interact with GitHub Actions

If you wanted to authorize 
as an app
, you=E2=80=99d use:

A 
GitHub OAuth App

Or a 
GitHub App
 with client ID & secret

But for our setup (you + your agent), a 
PAT is the right call.

Once you=E2=80=99ve copied it, I=E2=80=99ll show you exactly where to add i=

You're currently viewing your 
GitHub App
 configuration (
symbi-agent
) =E2=80=94 which is great for app-level integrat=
ions =E2=80=94 but if you just want 
Symbi-Assistant to access your repos and files directly
, a 
Personal Access Token (PAT)
 is simpler and quicker.

Here=E2=80=99s how to get the PAT:

Go to 
GitHub Tokens (Classic)

.

Click 
"Generate new token (classic)"
.

Name it something like 
elizaos-symbi-access
.

Check scopes
 like:

repo
 =E2=86=92 for private repos

read:user

workflow
 (optional, for GitHub Actions)

Click 
Generate
, then 
copy the token
 immediately.

Then, in ElizaOS:

Go to your 
symbi-assistant =E2=86=92 Secrets
 tab.

Under 
Name
, enter:

n=
ginx

Copy code

=

GITHUB_PAT

Under 
Value
, paste your new token.

Click 
Add
, then 
Save
.
