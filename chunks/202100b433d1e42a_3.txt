Trust engine (weighted 75% consensus, advisory)

Inputs: set of signed TrustAssertions on a subject; each carries signer ide=
ntity and score proposal
Weights: function of signer reputation, stake/endorsements, recency/decay, =
domain relevance
Process:
Verify signatures (RS256) and JWKS kid validity; reject stale/rotated keys
Normalize scores to [0,1]; apply weights; compute weighted mean and varianc=
e
Check quorum (minimum distinct signers, e.g., =E2=89=A53) and coverage

Output: signed ConsensusRound outcome with proof bundle (assertion IDs, sig=

Note: Always advisory; requires human verify for irreversible actions
