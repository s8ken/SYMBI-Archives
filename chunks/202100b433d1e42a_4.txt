Inputs to proceed

Multisig signer wallet addresses (2=E2=80=91of=E2=80=913)
AWS ap-southeast-2 confirmation for Trust Core + KMS, and Weaviate hosting =
choice (self=E2=80=91host vs managed)
Slack workspace IDs for pre=E2=80=91auth and app manifest install
Perplexity domain allowlist (initial) and plan tier
Any required third=E2=80=91party security reviews or pen=E2=80=91testing wi=
ndows
Preamble for external actions (example)

Purpose: Provision AWS KMS keys (ap-southeast-2) for RS256 signing; inputs:=
 account_id, region, key_aliases; awaiting your confirmation.
Micro=E2=80=91update

The Trust Core and Interface design aligns with your long=E2=80=91term deli=
verables and AU privacy constraints; once you confirm KMS/Weaviate hosting =
and provide multisig addresses, I will generate the repo scaffold, env temp=
lates, and initial migrations/configs. Validation: Scope and controls match=
 the stated objectives; proceeding to scaffold on your go.
