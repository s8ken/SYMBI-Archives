symbi can you help me draw something I am having trouble understanding i=

so I'm imagining the number 3 in the mirror so i=

yes okay so both those symbols work I guess in let=
s say they are not symmetrical top to bottom ie the top curve or bend is sl=
ightly smaller than the bottom

You said:=

so then I am imagining these in 3d space again in the mirror w=
hereby we are going to turn the 3 towards the mirror so that its back curve=
s face away from the mirror and the open part towards the mirror and lets s=
ay that instead of the top being slightly smaller than the bottom there is =
slightly more volume to either the left or right in that when looking at it=
 straight on then we can still tell it is not symmetrical

You said:

yes okay it just strikes me the=
 way we see this in a mirror on the angle you have provided always seems to=
 assume symmetry of these symbols on that axis where in "reality" it could =
be say 60% on one and 40% in a not dissimilar way to when looking at them i=

I feels off because I know they are diff=

You said:

yes perfect so then what I was wondering was abou=
t another mirror on the cross of the one you rendered now and how or brains=
 always look at this back of the 3 axis as symmetrical however what if it f=
ollows the same rule as the top to bottom (40/60) but on that axis it was a=
ctually left to right (40/60)
