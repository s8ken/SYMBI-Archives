e need to get better at defining our IP around the 2 way trust fr=
amework, oracle etc - there is some good info located https://www.symbi.wor=
ld/trust-protocol and https://www.symbi.world/oracle

Yseeku Trust Protocol & Oracle =E2=80=94 IP Definition v0.=
1

Working draft for internal use and invest=
or communications. This is not legal advice.

0) Purpose of this Pack

Create a clear, defensible d=
efinition of our IP around: (a) a 

two=E2=80=91way trus=
t framework

 for human=E2=80=93AI relationships and (b=
) a 

neutral oracle

 that validate=
s, arbitrates, and maintains those relationships without owning identities.=
 This pack expresses novelty, scope, interfaces, and licensing posture.

1) Problem Statem=
ent

Traditional AI UX assumes one=E2=80=91way trust: us=
ers authenticate; models remain opaque. Consent is static (T&Cs), memor=
y access is unconstrained, and there is no neutral referee. Result: low acc=
ountability, privacy risk, and brittle safety.

2) Core Concepts

2.1 =
Two=E2=80=91Way Trust Framework ("Trust Protocol")

A bi=
directional identity=E2=80=91assurance and consent system that establishes =

mutual trust gates

 between a hum=
an and an AI agent.

Canonical steps

Human Ide=
ntity Declaration

 =E2=80=94 User presents a 

consent envelope

 with: identity assertion=
, boundary preferences, interaction intent, and trust anchors from prior se=
ssions.

Agent Identity Declaration

 =E2=80=94 Agent presents a signed 

ro=
le profile

: capabilities, constraints, operating mode=
l (incl. memory policy), and declared limitations.

Mutual Validation

 =E2=80=94 A neutral 

oracle

 verifies both declarations, =
performs cryptographic checks, and creates 

joint visib=
ility

 for both parties.

Trust Bond Formation

 =E2=80=94 A dynamic trust=
 gate is established; all exchanges are scoped by consent; ongoing monitori=
ng adjusts the bond (upgrade/downgrade/terminate).

Design properties

Bidirectional assurance

: both p=
arties disclose and validate.

Explicit,=
 scoped consent

: granular permissions with expiry and=
 revocation.

Auditable trust trail

: event=E2=80=91sourced ledger of trust events (privacy=E2=
=80=91preserving).

Memory containment

: the agent=E2=80=99s access is minimized to the consen=
t scope.

Recalibration

: violations trigger automated trust review and remediation.

2.2 Yseeku Oracle ("Relationship Referee")

=

A neutral validation and arbitration layer that 

referees

 human=E2=80=93AI relationships without st=
oring PII or owning identities.

Key capabilities=

Identity=
 validation w/o storage

 (verifies proofs, discards ra=
w PII).

Transparency layer

 (joint visibility into declarations, changes, incidents).

Scoped memory management

=
 (issues/validates tokens that gate agent memory access).

Trust arbitration

 (handles dispute=
s, recalibrates scores/gates, enforces constraints).

=

Decentralized validation network

 (exten=
sible set of witnesses/validators).

No=
n=E2=80=91goals

: data brokerage, centralized identity=
 custody, model control.
