4) Novelty & Differentiation (Claim Angles)

Bidirectional identity as=
surance

 for human=E2=80=93AI interactions (not just u=
ser login), with symmetric declarations.

Consent envelope + role profile

 pair as 

=

co=E2=80=91signing

 primitives for trust formation.

Joint visibility channel

 that both parties can inspect (not one=E2=80=91sided logging).

Oracle=E2=80=91mediated trust recalibration=

 triggered by policy breaches or anomaly signals.

Scoped memory tokens

=
 that cryptographically gate agent memory (time=E2=80=91 and scope=E2=80=91=
bound).

Decentralized referee network

 providing validation without centralized identity cust=
ody.

These are phrased as 

claim angles

 for defensive publication or patent=
 drafting; finalize with counsel.

5) Security & Privacy Posture

Data minimization

: proofs > raw PII; discard raw assertions post=E2=80=91ve=
rification.

ZK & VCs

: leverage decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials =
(VCs), and zero=E2=80=91knowledge proofs for selective disclosure.

Event=E2=80=91sourced audit

: append=E2=80=91only, privacy=E2=80=91preserving logs with user=E2=80=91=
visible redactions.

Fail=E2=80=91safe d=
efaults

: if tokens expire or verification fails, agen=
ts revert to safest mode or terminate access.

6) IP Posture & Licensing Opt=
ions

Copyright

: documents/specs =C2=A9 Yseeku (year). Consider 
=

CC BY=E2=80=91ND

 for specs (keeps text =
intact) or 

CC BY=E2=80=91NC

 if w=
e want non=E2=80=91commercial reuse only.

Open Spec / Closed Ref Impl

: publish the protocol =
spec openly (defensive publication); keep oracle reference implementation p=
roprietary, or dual=E2=80=91license (e.g., AGPL for community, commercial l=
icense for partners).

Trademarks
=

: protect marks for "Yseeku", "Trust Protocol", and "Yseeku =
Oracle" (or distinctive names) in primary classes.

Patents (optional)

: file provisional(s) a=
round (a) bidirectional trust formation primitives and (b) scoped memory=E2=
=80=91token gating & recalibration.
