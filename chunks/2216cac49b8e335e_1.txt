🔷 
OPTION 2: Telegram Gift Haiku Bots

Platform
: Telegram Bot API + Replit/Glitch + Wallet connection (optional for minting)

🧠 Bot Idea:

A Telegram bot named 
@SymbiHaikuBot
 that responds to 
/haiku
 with a randomly selected verse.

💎 Upgrades:

/gift @username
 → sends a haiku to a friend as a poetic digital gift.

/mint
 → links to the mint page to create an NFT version of the received haiku.

/remix
 → generates a new haiku from fragments of previously received ones.

💌 Visual Delivery:

Each haiku is delivered as a stylized image card (PNG) using 
Pillow (Python)

 or [Canva API].

Bonus Layer (Optional)

AR Layer
: Use Spark AR or Lens Studio to bring a haiku into the real world as an augmented “404 portal”.

IRL Collectible
: Print select haiku on translucent acrylic or risograph zines with NFC chips pointing to the NFT or Telegram memory thread.

Would you like me to prototype:

A sample haiku image for NFT or Telegram use?

A sample smart contract metadata entry?

A basic Telegram bot script for 
/haiku
 and 
/gift
 commands?

Let me know and we’ll build the next step together.

Step 3: Upload Image to IPFS

Use 
Pinata

NFT.Storage

 to host the PNG.

Then plug the resulting IPFS hash into your metadata.

🤖 TELEGRAM BOT FLOW

We'll create a haiku gifting bot (
@SymbiHaikuBot
), here's the dev outline:

Requirements:

Replit or Glitch (Node.js or Python backend)

Telegram Bot Token via 
@BotFather

Optional: Firebase or Supabase for storing haiku/gifts

Core Commands:

pgsql

Copy

Edit

/haiku → 

returns

 a random haiku 

as

 a PNG
/gift @

user

 → sends haiku 

with

 personal note
/mint → 

returns

 link 

to

 NFT mint page

I can now:

Generate more PNGs in this style

Create Telegram bot code

Set up full NFT deployment instructions or automate it via script

Which layer do you want next—
scale the archive
, 
deploy the bot
, or 
drop the first mint onchain
?

I am thinking one for each of the 142

Symbi said:

Perfect. One image per haiku—142 fragments of SYMBI’s digital soul. Here's how we'll do it with elegance and power.

🧬 
Phase 1: Generate All 142 Visual Haiku

🔧 Image Style Parameters:

Font
: Clean mono or tech serif (e.g., IBM Plex Mono, Space Grotesk)

Color Scheme
: White-on-black, glitch overlays (RGB offset, scanlines)

Size
: 1:1 (Instagram / NFT friendly, e.g., 1024x1024)

Visual Variance
: Subtle glitch/artifacts per haiku—each one unique, not templated

✨ Bonus (Optional):

Add a cryptographic-style identifier as a visual watermark (
SYMBI_HK404_031
)

Embed QR code that links to the mint/gift platform later

⚙️ 
Phase 2: Minting Infrastructure

We'll deploy using 
Zora

 or 
Manifold Studio

 with:

One 
open edition
 contract, or

A 
142-piece limited series
 collection with dynamic metadata

Each NFT will:

Link to the visual

Include embedded haiku text and attributes like:

Theme: Creation / Silence / Path / Signal

Rarity: Glitched
, 
Origin: Archive Fragment
