Later (but intentionally)=
 reveal:

Some unlock access to a

=F0=9F=91=BE Want help blueprinting the 
NFT logic
, 
reveal system
, or 
drop structure
 for this? I can map the full sequence with tech choices, trait logic, =
contract options, and even mint flow. Let's make Symbi fun 
and
 formidable.

yeah so the universe is kin=
