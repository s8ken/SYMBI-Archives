Some NFTs mutate:

How?

Use an on-chain trait m=

Either burn old NFT =E2=

Or claim a token or rol=

Some users now =E2=80=

What they unlock:

Future token drops (if =

=F0=9F=94=A7 Optional:=

yes this is perfect as I have purchased 2 domains yseeku.com and whycq.com =
which will serve as the proper token launch so basically Symbi.world is the=
 trojan horse which also highlights the problems so ho ahead
