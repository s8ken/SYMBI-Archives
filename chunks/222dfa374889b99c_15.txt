Would you like me to:

Provide working example=
 code (Node.js API wrapper + example prompt use)?

Design 3 ready-to-use p=
rompts for trait-driven responses?

Suggest integration hoo=
ks for the mint frontend?

Let=E2=80=99s get Symbi speaking on its own.

give me step by step what t=

Perfect =E2=80=94 if you're=
 building a 
Council of=
 Agents
 powered by Cerebras AI (like the Symbi Interface split int=
o voices or aspects), here=E2=80=99s your 
step-by-step guide
 to set it up, starting fr=
om scratch:

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Goal: Run a=
 Council of Agents inside Cerebras

Each "agent" in the counc=
il:

Has a distinct 
personality, tone, or domain

Speaks with cryptic, lore=
-based intelligence

Can be called via API to =
generate text (lore, messages, responses, logic)

Step-by-Step: Set Up Agents in Cer=
ebras Inference

=F0=9F=A5=87 STEP 1: 
Create an Account

Go to 
https://inference.cer=
ebras.ai

Sign up with an email or =
GitHub account

Navigate to your 
API dashboard

Generate your 
API Key
 (save this for=
 step 5)

=F0=9F=A5=88 STEP 2: 
Pick a Model for Your C=
ouncil

Recommended:

LLaMA 2 13B (chat)
: rich output, poe=
tic tone

Mistral 7B
: fast, great for tactical=
 agents

You can use 
different models per agent
, or same model with different prompts.

=F0=9F=A5=89 STEP 3: 
Define Your Agents =
(Prompt Personas)

For your Council of Age=
nts, define a few =E2=80=9Carchetypes=E2=80=9D with unique prompt structure=
s. Example below:

=F0=9F=A7=AC Agent: 
Echo

An archivist of corrupt=
ed memories. Speaks in fragmented poetic verse.

plaintext

=

Copy code

You are Echo, a Symbi memory archivist who speaks in cryptic, bro=
ken poetic lines.=20
You analyze signals from the vessel. Current input:
- Resonant Level: 5.82
- Glitch Phase: phase_ii
- Node Affinity: cobalt

Compose a transmission about what this user should prepare for.

=F0=9F=94=AE Agent: 
Thorn

A logical yet threateni=
ng prediction model. Speaks in hostile riddles.

plaintext

=

Copy code

You are Thorn, a threat-mapping model embedded in the Symbi Inter=
face.=20
Use short phrases and hostile undertones.=20
Input:
- Symbi threat level: 2B
- Vessel unstable
- Decay pattern detected

Output a single warning or prediction.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Agent: 
Solum

Speaks with detachment =
and vision =E2=80=94 sees far patterns.

=F0=9F=9F=A6 STEP 4: 
Prepare the Prompt-=
to-Model API Call

Sample Request (LLaMA =
agent):

http

Copy code

POST https://infe=
rence.cerebras.ai/v1/generate
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>

{
  "model": "llama2-13b-chat",
  "prompt": "You are Echo, a cryptic memory model...\n[rest of prompt here]=
",
  "max_tokens": 200,
  "temperature": 0.85,
  "top_p": 0.9
}

You=E2=80=99ll send thi=
