From the first image, the=

Copy code

This

Token Info from Second Image

The second image shows:

Unknown Token

Balance: 
44,867,000,000T

Warning: "This token is u=
nverified. Only interact with tokens you trust."

This suggests:

Your wallet app (likely M=
etaMask, Trust Wallet, or similar) 
detected a token
 associated with your wallet.

However, 
the token is not listed on any stand=
ard token registry
 like 
Etherscan's token database

, h=
ence it's labeled =E2=80=9CUnknown Token.=E2=80=9D

The extremely high balanc=
e (trillions) is a 
c=
ommon red flag
 for 
spam tokens
, 
airdrop scams
, or 
honeypot tokens
.

=F0=9F=9A=A8 
Important Warning

Unverified tokens like =
this often:

Have 
no real liquidity
 (you can'=
t sell them for ETH or stablecoins).

Are 
scam attempts
: clicking "Se=
ll" or interacting with malicious smart contracts can drain your wallet.

May display fake value,=
 tricking you into interacting with them.

=E2=9C=85 What You Can=
 Do

Lookup the token on 
Etherscan

:

Paste the Ethereum address in 
htt=
ps://etherscan.io/address/0x2e45d47b2f0d0a23500e9148882b136914cc1f65

Then check the =E2=80=
=9CERC-20 Token Holdings=E2=80=9D tab =E2=80=94 it will show:

Token name (if known)

Token contract address

Token symbol (or lack t=
hereof)

How many holders it has=

Check the token=E2=80=99s contract on Eth=
erscan
:

From the address above, you=E2=80=99ll find the contract for the =E2=80=9CU=
nknown Token.=E2=80=9D Look up that contract too to see:

Source code (if verifie=
d)

Transactions

Holders and transfers

Do NOT attempt to sell or swap this token=
 via unknown DApps
 =E2=80=94 scams often work by getting you to au=
thorize malicious contracts.

If you'd like, I can pull up and analyze the token d=
ata from Etherscan right now. Want me to do that?

Lure them into connecting=

icious websites
 that attempt to "buy" or "sell" the fake token =E2=
=80=94 then steal assets when the user signs a transaction

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Do NO=
