Approve or sign any trans=
action involving the token unless you're absolutely sure of what it does.

=E2=9C=85 You Can:

Hide the token
 in your wallet ap=
p (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet)

Use a block explorer (l=
ike 
Ether=
scan

) to watch the token's 
contract
 (check how many holders exist=
, if it=E2=80=99s actively traded, etc.)

Report it to your walle=
t provider if you think it=E2=80=99s spam

Let me know if you want me to look up the token cont=
ract and break it down (supply, holders, code, etc.), or if you'd like to t=
rack real tokens that are legitimate in your wallet.

Great, thanks for the link =E2=80=94 you're =
referring to this Uniswap pool:

=F0=9F=91=89 
Uniswap Pool for 0x053da4662ab98=
f78254437580105b37aa999749c

=F0=9F=94=8D Summary of =
That Pool:

This Uniswap V3 pool is t=
ied to the 
BTCMTX to=
ken
, and based on live data from Uniswap:

Token Address
: 
0x053da4662ab98f78254437580105b37aa999749c

Token Name
: Bitcoin MetaX (BTCMTX)

Liquidity Pool
: Exists =E2=80=94 but=

extremely low liqui=
dity

TVL (Total Value Locked)
: Essentiall=
y 
$0
 or clo=
se to it

Swaps
: Rare or inactive

Price impact
 on any attempt to swap =
would be 
extreme
 (you=E2=80=99d get back nearly nothing)

=E2=9C=85 Conclusion:

BTCMTX is worthless in practice
, eve=
n though it technically exists on-chain and has a Uniswap pool.

Here's why:

There=E2=80=99s 
no real liquidity
 =
=E2=80=94 so you can=E2=80=99t sell your billions of tokens for ETH or USDC=
.

It=E2=80=99s likely part=
 of a 
vanity token s=
cam
: they create a token, send it to thousands of wallets, set up =
a fake or dead Uniswap pool to look legit.

Some of these pools are=
 designed so 
you=
=E2=80=99ll lose ETH when attempting to sell the token
 (via a mali=
cious contract or extreme slippage).

=E2=9C=85 Best Action:=

Ignore or hide it
 in your wallet=
.

Do 
not try to sell it
, especia=
lly if a website promises to help you do so =E2=80=94 that=E2=80=99s a scam=
 entry point.

Would you like me to check this token's smart contra=
ct for any risky features (like blocking transfers or trapping ETH)?

yes please

Error talking to connector

Wolfram Alpha couldn=E2=80=99t=
 analyze that token contract directly =E2=80=94 it doesn=E2=80=99t handle o=
n-chain contract audits or token logic inspection.

But I can break this down=
 manually from what=E2=80=99s visible on 
Etherscan

:

=F0=9F=94=8D 
BTCMTX Token Contract: 
0x053d...49c

Here=E2=80=99s what stand=

=E2=9C=85 
Verified Contract
: The sou=

can=E2=80=99t inspect what the smart contract actually does
.

=E2=9D=8C 
No Read/Write Functions
 ar=
e available on Etherscan due to this.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
No trading activity
 beyond spam or bot-driven volume.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Token name and symbol
 are 
not standard-re=
gistered
 with Etherscan (hence =E2=80=9CUnknown Token=E2=80=9D in your=
 wallet).

=E2=9D=8C 
No liquidity
 beyond that e=
xtremely thin Uniswap pool.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Commo=
n Scam Pattern

The setup fits this typic=
al 
"honeypot" scam p=
attern
:

Mint billions of tokens.

Send huge amounts to rand=
om wallets to appear valuable.

Set up a Uniswap pool wi=
th 
tiny
 E=
TH/TOKEN liquidity.

Users try to sell =E2=
=86=92 either:

Contract 
blocks transfers
, or

Slippage wipes out
 value (get pe=

Contract

You should treat 
BTCMTX
 as:

Worthless

Potentially dangerous to interact with

Meant to trick you
 into approvin=
g malicious transactions

=F0=9F=9B=91 Do 
not
 attempt to s=
ell, transfer, or connect to unknown DApps offering to convert it.

If you=E2=80=99d like, I can walk you through how to=

safely revoke tok=
en allowances
 or 
hide it in your wall
