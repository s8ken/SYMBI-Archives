Reasoned about missing attachments for a couple of seconds

Iâm still not receiving any file or text. I only see your message asking, âanything?â with no attachment or content. If youâre trying to upload a file, itâs still not coming through on my end.

If you can, try copying the contents of the file and pasting them into the chat directly. If thatâs not possible because itâs not text-based (e.g., an image or PDF), you might want to use a link to a file-sharing service where the file is hosted. Let me know if you have any success with that.
