Thou=
ght for 20s

Yes, I can read and summarize the G=
itHub repository at 
https://github.com/s8ke=
n/symbi-symphony
 (noting the likely typos in your query for "can you re=

Project Overview

SYMBI-Symphony
 (styled as SYMBI Sympho=
ny =F0=9F=8E=BC) is a unified AI agent orchestration framework. It serves a=
s a comprehensive platform for creating, managing, and orchestrating AI age=
nts, with built-in support for advanced authentication, monitoring, and col=
laboration features. It's part of the broader SYMBI AI ecosystem, which inc=
ludes related projects like SYMBI Resonance, SYMBI Synergy, SYMBI Vault, an=
d the Tactical Command Interface.

Key Features

Agent Ma=
nagement
: Includes an Agent SDK for development, an Agent Factory =
for template-based agent creation, and a rich type system for defining agen=
ts and workflows.

Authenti=
cation & Authorization
: Multi-factor authentication (MFA), rol=
e-based access control (RBAC), JWT token management, and session handling.

Monitori=
ng & Observability
: Metrics collection, distributed tracing, s=
tructured logging, and intelligent alerting.

Quick Start

To g=
et started:

Install via npm: 
npm install symbi-symphony
.

Basic usage example (in TypeScript):

=
TypeScript

=

Copy

import

 { 

AgentSDK

, 

AgentConfig

 } 

from

 =
'symbi-symphony'

;

const

 agentConfig

:

=
 AgentConfig

 =3D

 {

  id: 

'agent-1'

,

  name: 
=

'MyAgent'

,

  type: 
=

'workflow'

,

  // ... other config

};

const

 sdk

 ne=
w

 AgentSDK

();

.

registerAgent

(

agentConfig

);

This=
 sets up and registers a basic agent.

Project Structure

The =
repository is organized in TypeScript under the 
src/
 directory:

core/agent/
: Core agent logic (
agent-sdk.ts
, 
agent-factory.ts

).

core/auth/
: Authentication modules (

, 
authorizer.ts
, 
jwt-helper.ts
, 
auth-types.ts
).

core/monitoring/
: Observability tools (
metrics-collector.ts
, 
logger.ts
, 
alert-manager.ts
, 
tracer.ts
).

index.ts
: Main exports for the library.

Key =
configuration interfaces include:

AgentConfig
: Defines agent properties like 
id
, 
name
, 
type
.

AuthConfig
: Handles JWT secrets, token expiry, etc.

MonitoringConfig
: Toggles metrics, log levels, etc.

The =
repo appears to be an early-stage or niche project with no visible stars, f=
orks, watchers, or open issues in the fetched metadata (it may be new or pr=
ivate in visibility). If you'd like me to dive deeper into specific files (=
e.g., the full README or a particular module), analyze code, or check relat=
ed repos in the SYMBI ecosystem, just let me know!
