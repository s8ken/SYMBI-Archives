 (a blockchain data analytics platform) based on its GitHub=
 repository or public sources. However, it could integrate seamlessly in a =
hypothetical setup by leveraging SYMBI's Agent SDK to build custom agents t=
hat interact with Dune's API for querying and analyzing on-chain data. This=
 would enable data-driven AI workflows, such as real-time blockchain monito=
ring, predictive analytics, or automated alerting based on crypto metrics.

How It Could Work: Step-by-Step Integrat=
ion

Setup Au=
thentication in SYMBI Agents
:

Dune's API uses simple API key authentic=
ation, generated via your Dune account settings. In SYMBI-Symphony, configu=
re an agent's 
AuthConfi=
g
 to securely store and manage the Dune API key (e.g., via JWT or se=
ssion handling). This ensures secure, role-based access for agents querying=
 sensitive blockchain data.
docs.dune.com

Agent Or=
chestration for Data Fetching
:

Use SYMBI's Agent Factory to create a sp=
ecialized agent (e.g., a "BlockchainDataAgent") with a workflow type. This =
agent would make HTTP requests to Dune's SQL endpoints to execute custom qu=
eries and fetch results in JSON format.

The agent would POST to Dune's execution=
 endpoint, poll for results (via 
/results
), and parse the JSON response for blockchain metr=
ics like transaction volumes or token transfers.

Data Pro=
cessing and AI Analysis
:

Orchestrate a chain of agents: The data-=
fetching agent passes results to an "AnalysisAgent" (e.g., using external L=
LM calls via SYMBI's workflow types) for AI-driven insights, like anomaly d=
etection in DeFi activity.

SYMBI's rich type system could define cu=
stom schemas for Dune data (e.g., 
BlockchainMetrics
 interface) to ensure type-safe handling=
.

Monitori=
ng and Observability
:

Enable SYMBI's 
MonitoringConfig
 (e.g., 
metricsEnabled: true
, 
tracingEnabled: true
) to tr=
ack agent performance on Dune queries=E2=80=94such as query latency or erro=
r rates. This data could even loop back to Dune for visualization in custom=
 dashboards, creating a feedback loop for observability.
docs.dune.com

Advanced=
 Workflows with Dune's Features
:

For real-time needs, use Dune's Sim APIs=
 (high-performance endpoints for EVM/SVM chains) in agents for low-latency =
data streams, ideal for trading bots or risk assessment workflows.

Preset endpoints (no SQL required) could=
 simplify agents for common topics like NFT sales or protocol TVL, reducing=
 boilerplate code.
