When to Go It Alone

Use SYMB=
I-Symphony Solo If
:

Your needs are general AI orchestration =
(e.g., chatbots, internal workflows) without blockchain data. It's lightwei=
ght for non-data-heavy apps, avoiding Dune's learning curve (SQL skills) an=
d costs (paid tiers for high-volume queries).

Pros: Faster setup, no external dependen=
cies. Cons: Misses rich on-chain datasets=E2=80=94stick to mock data or oth=
er sources.

Use Dune=
.com Solo If
:

You're focused on pure analytics/explora=
tion (e.g., building dashboards for a team). No AI needed? Dune's community=
 queries and visualizations are plug-and-play.

Pros: Zero-code for basics, vast pre-bui=
lt datasets. Cons: Manual for automation; scaling to AI requires custom scr=
ipts (less elegant than SYMBI).

Hybrid V=
erdict
: Go integrated unless your project is tiny or data-agnostic=
. The complementarity amplifies both: Dune provides the "what's happening o=
n-chain," SYMBI handles the "what do we do about it?" For a proof-of-concep=
t, start with Dune's free tier + SYMBI's npm install=E2=80=94total setup un=
der an hour.

If y=
ou share your specific use case (e.g., DeFi monitoring or NFT trends), I ca=
n refine this with a tailored code snippet or cost estimate!
