 summaries (NEEDS CONTENT)

=E2=8F=B3 At least 3 downloadab=
le PDFs (CRITICAL)

=E2=8F=B3 Test all links work (=
VERIFY)

=E2=8F=B3 Get 2-3 educator test=
imonials (OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL)

Timeline: Complete 2-4 this week, then send letter

You d=
on't need everything perfect - but you need:

You'v=
e moved from planning to execution:

=E2=9C=85 Website structure bui=

=E2=9C=85 Educator hub live

=E2=9C=85 Professional organiza=
tion

=E2=9C=85 Clear value propositi=

The r=
emaining 20%:

Case study content pages

Downloadable PDFs

Testing/polish

Test everything
