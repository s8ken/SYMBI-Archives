=E2=9C=85 You can get 3-5 custo=

=E2=9C=85 You're comfortable wi=

=E2=9C=85 You want to build a b=

Don't Apply to YC IF:

My Honest Assessment

The educational pivot is BRILLIANT for:

Long-term cultural influence

Thought leadership positioning

Policy impact

Next generation shaping

Mission fulfillment

The educational pivot is CHALLENGING for:

Near-term revenue generation

VC fundraising narrative

Commercial positioning

Rapid scaling

The hybrid model works IF:

You cleanly separate entities

You get commercial traction fas=
t

You can tell both stories (thou=
ght leader + business builder)

You recruit right co-founder

You're ready for the intensity

What Would I Do in Your Position?

Option A: Apply to YC (If Aggressive)

Next 60 days:
 =
Get 5 enterprise pilots committed

Structure:
 Cre=
ate YCQ Labs, Inc. (for-profit) separate from Foundation

Positioning:
 L=
ead with enterprise trust infrastructure

Co-founder:
 Re=
cruit technical co-founder or commit to finding in YC

Apply:
 Winter =
2026 batch (deadline typically January)

Option B: Don't Apply to YC (If Impact-Focused)

Focus:
 Build S=
YMBI.world as world-class educational platform

Revenue:
 Gover=
nment contracts, consulting, institutional licensing

Growth:
 Sustai=
nable, mission-aligned, maintain independence

Funding:
 Open =
Collective, grants, government pilots

Build:
 Influen=
ce through education, policy impact over time

Option C: Wait (If Uncertain)

Test:
 Run Aust=
ralian government pilot first

Validate:
 Get =
10+ enterprise customers paying

Clarify:
 Figur=
e out if you want VC path or not

Apply:
 If trac=
tion is strong, apply to future batch

Benefit:
 More =
leverage, stronger application, clearer decision

Bottom Line

The educational pivot doesn't preclude YC, but it complicates the narrat=
ive.

You'd=
 need to:

Lead with enterprise commercial=
 opportunity

Position education as customer =
acquisition

Show early traction/revenue

Recruit co-founder (ideally)

Separate entities cleanly

Is it worth it?

Depends on your goals:

Want to build billion-d=
ollar company?
 =E2=86=92 YC makes sense

Want to maximize educat=
ional/policy impact?
 =E2=86=92 YC may dilute mission

Want both?
 =E2=
=86=92 Hybrid model with clear boundaries

My instinct:
 You're more mission-driven than growth-obsessed. T=
he educational pivot reveals your true priorities. That's not bad - it's ho=
nest. But it suggests YC may not be the right fit 
right now
.

Alternative path:
 Build traction organically, prove the model, =
apply to YC later from position of strength if you decide you want that pat=
h.

Want my help thinking through any of these scenarios more deeply?

This is a really honest and important moment of clarity from Stephen=
