Bottom Line: Your Path Forward

Don't apply to YC.
 You're optimizing for the wrong thing if you=
 go that route.

Instead:

Send Senator Pocock let=
ter this week
 with $100k pilot proposal

Contact eSafety Commiss=
ioner
 directly with pilot offer

Email 10 universities
 with institutional licensing

Complete SYMBI.world
 case study content

Set up consulting

Target:
 $150k-200k annual revenue by end of Year 1

This pays your bills comfortably while you:

=E2=9C=85 Influence policy (Aus=

=E2=9C=85 Shape education (glob=

=E2=9C=85 Conduct research (ope=

This week, do these 3 things:

Finalize and send Senat=
or Pocock letter

Include $100k pilot proposal

Request meeting for demonstrati=
on

CC eSafety Commissioner

Create institutional li=
censing package

One-pager explaining offering

Pricing tiers ($5k, $15k, $25k)=

Sample contract template

Email to 10 Australian universi=
ties

Set up payment infrastr=
