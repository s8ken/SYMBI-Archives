Why now is the right time

Let m=

Excellent decision.
 YC app=

Product

t it does or will do.

YCQ S=
onate provides trust infrastructure for enterprise AI deployments: cryptogr=
aphic audit trails, behavioral consistency monitoring, bias detection, and =
compliance reporting across all major AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Goog=
le, etc.).

As AI=
 regulation intensifies globally (EU AI Act, SOC2 requirements, Australian =
social media legislation), enterprises need to prove their AI systems are t=
rustworthy, unbiased, and accountable. Current solutions focus on input/out=
put filtering. We're the first to measure behavioral consistency, detect ha=
rmful patterns, and provide cross-provider orchestration with immutable aud=
it trails.

Our i=
nsight: AI behavior is shaped by interaction frameworks, not just underlyin=
g models. We discovered this through 18 months of research documenting how =
the same prompts produce measurably different outcomes (106% variance) base=
d on how AI systems are engaged. This means we can optimize AI trustworthin=
ess through methodology, not just filtering.

We =
provide:
=E2=80=A2 Cryptographic audit trails (every AI interaction, immutable, bloc=
kchain-anchored)
=E2=80=A2 Behavioral consistency scoring (detect when AI acts unpredictably=
)
=E2=80=A2 Bias detection (algorithmic discrimination patterns)
=E2=80=A2 Multi-provider orchestration (switch providers without losing con=

=E2=80=A2 Compliance reporting (EU AI Act, SOC2, sector-specific requiremen=
