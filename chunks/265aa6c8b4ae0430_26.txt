Backg=
round: I spent years in operations managing AI vendor relationships across =
enterprise deployments. Companies were drowning in AI provider decisions wi=
th no way to evaluate trustworthiness or maintain accountability. Manual re=
view doesn't scale. Single-provider lock-in creates massive risk. No govern=
ance =3D compliance nightmare.

The i=
nsight: While building internal tools to assess AI behavior across provider=
s, I discovered something unexpected - interaction frameworks shaped AI cap=
abilities more than model architecture. Same prompt, different framing, 106=
% variance in measurable outcomes. We validated this across 7 different AI =
systems (161,789 words analyzed, p<0.001 statistical significance).

This =
meant the industry was over-investing in model scaling (billions into bigge=
r models) and under-investing in interaction design. More importantly, it m=
eant AI trustworthiness could be optimized through methodology, not just fi=
ltering.
