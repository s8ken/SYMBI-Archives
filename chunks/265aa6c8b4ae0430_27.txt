How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

B2B S=
aaS model with three revenue streams:

Primary: Enterprise SaaS ($5k-50k/month per customer)

=E2=80=A2 Small/mid: $5k-15k/month (10-100 employees using AI)
=E2=80=A2 Enterprise: $25k-50k/month (1000+ employees, complex requirements=
)
=E2=80=A2 Pricing based on: AI interaction volume, number of providers, com=
pliance requirements

Secondary: Government Contracts ($50k-500k per contract)

=E2=80=A2 Classification system implementation (Australian pilot: $100k)
=E2=80=A2 Policy consulting and framework development
=E2=80=A2 Multi-jurisdictional as other countries adopt similar legislation=

Tertiary: Institutional Licensing ($5k-25k/year)

=E2=80=A2 Universities using frameworks for AI ethics programs
=E2=80=A2 Research institutions needing governance infrastructure
=E2=80=A2 Think tanks and NGOs working on AI policy

TAM=
: $62B AI governance/compliance market (Gartner estimates)
=E2=80=A2 40% of Global 2000 will face AI compliance requirements by 2026
=E2=80=A2 EU AI Act affects 450M people, creates massive compliance need
=E2=80=A2 Every enterprise adopting AI needs trust infrastructure

Con=
servative 5-year projection:
=E2=80=A2 Year 1: $300k (3 enterprise customers + government contract)
=E2=80=A2 Year 2: $2M (20 enterprise customers, expanding)
=E2=80=A2 Year 3: $8M (80 customers, international expansion)
=E2=80=A2 Year 4: $25M (250 customers, established category leader)
=E2=80=A2 Year 5: $75M+ (enterprise standard, multiple product lines)

Path =
to $1B+ valuation: Become infrastructure layer for all enterprise AI govern=
ance. Similar to how Datadog became standard for monitoring or PagerDuty fo=
r incident response. High-margin SaaS with network effects (more customers =
=3D better behavioral baselines =3D better product).
