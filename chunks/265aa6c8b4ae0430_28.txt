Progress

How many active users or customers do you have? If you have some particu=
larly valuable customers, who are they?

Pre-r=
evenue, building initial customer pipeline:

Government Sector:

=E2=80=A2 Australian Government pilot proposal submitted ($100k for 6-month=
 implementation)
=E2=80=A2 Senator David Pocock's office reviewing (he's been vocal on tech =
policy)
=E2=80=A2 eSafety Commissioner direct outreach (met with OpenAI, Anthropic =
- we address their stated concerns)
=E2=80=A2 ACMA Age Assurance Technology Trial submission pending

Education Sector (Proving Ground):

=E2=80=A2 SYMBI.world launched November 2025
=E2=80=A2 12 lesson plans, 24 discussion frameworks live
=E2=80=A2 Early educator signups generating enterprise awareness
=E2=80=A2 3 university philosophy departments interested in institutional l=
icensing

Enterprise Pipeline (Building):

=E2=80=A2 5 enterprise compliance teams in demo discussions
=E2=80=A2 Industries: FinTech (2), HealthTech (1), Consulting (2)
=E2=80=A2 Typical profile: 500-5000 employees, active AI deployment, compli=
ance concerns
=E2=80=A2 Converting these to paid pilots is Q1 2026 focus

Validation:

=E2=80=A2 7-system technical validation across major AI providers
=E2=80=A2 Research methodology peer-reviewable (161,789 words analyzed)
=E2=80=A2 Statistical significance demonstrated (p<0.001)
=E2=80=A2 Cross-platform reproducibility proven

Targe=
t: 1 government contract + 3 enterprise pilots closed by end of Q1 2026.

Do you have any preliminary insights from customer conversations?

Pain Point Validation:

From =
15+ enterprise compliance conversations:

"We have no way to audit what o=
ur AI systems are actually doing" - FinTech Head of Compliance

"Our biggest fear is an AI syst=
em giving biased advice and us having no record" - HealthTech CTO

"SOC2 auditors are asking about=
 AI governance and we have nothing to show them" - Consulting COO

"We're locked into one provider=
 because switching means losing all conversation context" - SaaS CEO

"Manual review of AI interactio=
ns doesn't scale past 50 employees" - Legal Tech VP Ops

Key Insights:

1. Audit Trail is #1 Need (Not Bias Detection)

Initially thought bias detection would be primary value. Wrong. Companies d=
esperately need immutable audit trails first. Bias detection is secondary v=
alue-add.
=E2=80=A2 Pivoted messaging: Lead with "cryptographic audit trails" not "bi=
as detection"
=E2=80=A2 Product roadmap: Audit infrastructure priority, bias detection fo=
llows

2. Compliance Drivers Stronger Than Performance

Companies aren't primarily concerned with "better AI performance" - they're=
 terrified of regulatory fines and lawsuits.
=E2=80=A2 EU AI Act: =E2=82=AC35M fines for non-compliance
=E2=80=A2 Existing regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2) now apply to AI systems
=E2=80=A2 Sales approach: Lead with compliance, performance is bonus

3. Multi-Provider Orchestration Underrated

Didn't realize how painful provider lock-in is until talking to customers. =
Companies want to:
=E2=80=A2 A/B test providers on same use case
=E2=80=A2 Switch providers without losing conversation context
=E2=80=A2 Hedge against single provider failure/price increases
=E2=80=A2 Meet data residency requirements (different providers for differe=
nt regions)

4. Government Market Larger Than Expected

Australian legislation created immediate $100k opportunity. Similar legisla=
tion coming in:
=E2=80=A2 EU member states (implementation 2025-2027)
=E2=80=A2 UK (Online Safety Bill)
=E2=80=A2 Canada (discussing similar approaches)
=E2=80=A2 US states (CA, NY exploring age verification)
=E2=80=A2 Government contracts =3D $500k+ opportunities, slower sales cycle=
s but huge validation
