Founders

Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-com=
puter) system to your advantage.

Context:
 2018, I was managing operations for a company using 5 =
different AI vendors (chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis, image reco=
gnition, recommendations). No vendor wanted to integrate with competitors. =
We were maintaining 5 separate systems, massive operational overhead, data =
silos everywhere.

The Problem:
 Each vendor insisted their integration was "standa=
rd" but required completely different data formats, authentication methods,=
 and API patterns. IT said 6-month integration project minimum. Business ne=
eded it working in 6 weeks.

The Hack:

I realized all vendors were using the same underlying principle - HTTP requ=
ests with JSON responses - but wrapping it in artificial complexity to crea=
te switching costs.

Ins=
tead of building 5 custom integrations, I built one "universal translator":
=E2=80=A2 Created abstraction layer that normalized all vendor APIs to sing=
le internal format
=E2=80=A2 Used vendor documentation against them - they'd documented their =
formats publicly, just made them seem complex
=E2=80=A2 Built it in 2 weeks using open-source tools and ChatGPT (before i=
t was cool)
=E2=80=A2 Deployed without IT approval initially (ask forgiveness not permi=
ssion)
=E2=80=A2 When it worked, IT adopted it as official solution

Outcome:

=E2=80=A2 Reduced 6-month project to 2-week prototype + 2-week refinement
=E2=80=A2 Saved company ~$500k in integration costs
=E2=80=A2 Could switch vendors in <1 day instead of 3-month migration
=E2=80=A2 Actually switched 2 vendors who tried to raise prices (suddenly w=
e had negotiating leverage)
=E2=80=A2 This experience directly led to building YCQ Sonate - multi-provi=
der orchestration is the core value prop

Lesson:
 Complex systems are usually artificially complex to cre=
ate lock-in. Find the underlying simplicity, abstract it, give users power =
back.

This =
is what we're doing with AI trust infrastructure - vendors want lock-in, we=
're building the abstraction layer that gives enterprises control.

Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class=
 or work, that two or more of you created together.

Challenge:
 I'm a solo founder currently, which I know is YC's l=
east favorite scenario. Here's why I haven't found co-founder yet and what =
I'm doing about it:

Why Solo:

=E2=80=A2 This problem emerged from unique operations experience - hard to =
find someone with same insight
=E2=80=A2 Self-taught technical skills while building - co-founder search d=
elayed by urgent building
=E2=80=A2 Mission-driven focus meant prioritizing product over perfect team=
 initially

Projects Demonstrating Collaboration Ability:
