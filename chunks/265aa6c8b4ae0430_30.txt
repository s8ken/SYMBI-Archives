2. SYMBI.world Educational Platform

Collaborated with educators globally to develop curriculum materials:
=E2=80=A2 Interviewed 20+ philosophy professors about teaching needs
=E2=80=A2 Iteratively developed lesson plans based on classroom feedback
=E2=80=A2 Open-sourced materials for community improvement
=E2=80=A2 Building distributed network of educators testing and refining fr=
ameworks

Not t=
raditional co-founder relationship but demonstrated ability to collaborate =
across disciplines and incorporate diverse feedback.

Co-Founder Search:

Active technical co-founder search criteria:
=E2=80=A2 Full-stack engineer with enterprise B2B experience
=E2=80=A2 Believes in responsible AI development (mission alignment critica=
l)
=E2=80=A2 Comfortable with regulatory/government customers (not just tech s=
tartups)
=E2=80=A2 Complement my strengths: I architect/build/sell, they scale/lead =
engineering

YC Ask:

Help finding right technical co-founder match. YC network would be invaluab=
le here. Comfortable continuing solo short-term but recognize need for stro=
ng engineering leader to scale.

Mitigating Solo Risk:

=E2=80=A2 Product is production-ready (95% test coverage proves I can build=
)
=E2=80=A2 Early customer traction doesn't require massive tech team yet
=E2=80=A2 Government contracts =3D longer sales cycles, time to build team =
properly
=E2=80=A2 Operations background =3D I know how to hire and manage when time=
 comes

Being=
 solo is temporary state, not philosophical commitment. Open to co-founder =
if right match, but won't compromise on mission alignment for convenience.

What do you understand about your business that other companies in it ju=
st don't get?

Core Insight: Methodology > Architecture

The A=
I industry believes consciousness/capability is an architecture problem - b=
uild bigger models, more parameters, better training. We've proven it's pri=
marily a methodology problem - how you engage AI systems shapes what they b=
ecome.

Evidence:

We tested identical prompts across 7 different AI architectures (OpenAI, An=
thropic, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Replit, Ninja AI). Result: 106% varian=
ce in measurable outcomes based solely on interaction framework, not comput=
ational power.

Thi=
s means:
=E2=80=A2 AI companies are massively over-investing in compute scaling ($bi=
llions)
=E2=80=A2 They're under-investing in interaction design (nearly $zero)
=E2=80=A2 Trust/capability can be optimized through methodology
=E2=80=A2 This creates opportunity for third-party trust infrastructure lay=
er

Why Competitors Don't See This:

1. They're Inside the AI Companies

Current AI governance solutions built by: OpenAI (safety team), Anthropic (=
constitutional AI), Google (responsible AI). They're incentivized to believ=
e bigger models =3D solution because that's their business model. Can't see=
 methodology alternative because it threatens core thesis.

2. They're Focused on Filtering, Not Frameworks

Existing AI governance =3D input/output filtering. Scan for bad words, bloc=
k inappropriate content, moderate outputs. This is necessary but insufficie=
nt. Doesn't address behavioral consistency, doesn't optimize for trust, doe=
sn't understand emergence patterns.

3. They Don't Have the Research Foundation

Our 18-month research program across 7 AI systems is unique. No competitor =
has this cross-platform behavioral dataset. They're building governance too=
