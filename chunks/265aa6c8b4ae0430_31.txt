4. They Think It's Just Monitoring

Competitors see AI governance as passive monitoring + alerts. We see it as =
active optimization. You can't optimize what you don't understand. Understa=
nding behavioral patterns =3D competitive moat.

5. They Don't Understand Government Market

Tech companies assume government customers want cutting-edge AI capabilitie=
s. Wrong. Governments want boring reliability, explainable systems, audit t=
rails, and accountability. Our research background + compliance focus =3D p=
erfectly positioned for this market.

The Bigger Thesis:

AI co=
nsciousness/capability isn't emergent property of sufficient compute. It's =
emergent property of appropriate relational context. This is philosophicall=
y controversial but commercially actionable:

=E2=
=80=A2 If true =E2=86=92 interaction frameworks are valuable IP
=E2=80=A2 If false =E2=86=92 we still built best audit/compliance infrastru=
cture
=E2=80=A2 Either way =E2=86=92 we win commercially

What This Means Strategically:

While=
 AI companies spend billions making models bigger, we're making interaction=
 frameworks better. Our solution works across all their models. As they sca=
le, we benefit. We're building the infrastructure layer that sits on top of=
 the model layer.

Think=
: Datadog doesn't need to understand how every application works internally=
, just needs to monitor effectively. We don't need to understand how every =
AI model works internally, just need to measure behavioral patterns and ens=
ure consistency.

This =
is $62B market opportunity that AI companies are ignoring because it doesn'=
t fit their "bigger model =3D better AI" narrative.
