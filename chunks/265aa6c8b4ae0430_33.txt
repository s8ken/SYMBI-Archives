 - you've created a comprehensive library that=
 covers:

Consciousness emergence (origin=

Trust & governance (new add=
itions)

Bias & discrimination (crit=
ically important)

2.=

Smart Categorization

Separ=
ating "Consciousness Case Studies" from "Trust & Ethics Case Studies" i=
s excellent because:

Consciousness studies =3D philo=
sophical/theoretical (attracts philosophy departments)

Trust studies =3D practical/app=
lied (attracts CS/policy/business schools)

Different audiences get what th=
ey need

Shows breadth of expertise

3.=

Professional Structure

The h=
ub layout is clean and navigable:

Clear value proposition at top

Three main resource types (Less=

Featured resources highlighted

Multiple pathways to content

Academic integration section sh=

Critical Issues to Address

Priority 1: Verify All Links Actually Work

I can=
 see these links exist, but I need to test if they have content:

/educators/lesson-plans

/educators/discussion-guides

/educators/downloads

/educators/rubrics

/educators/trust-case-studies

Individual case study pages

Test this yourself RIGHT NOW:

ba=
sh

# Click every l=
ink on the page

# Document which ones:

# =E2=9C=85 Work with content

# =E2=8F=B3 Work but need more content=

# =E2=9D=8C 404 or empty

=

This is critical before any outreach.
 Nothing worse than promis=
ing resources that don't exist.

Priority 2: Fulfill Promises or Adjust Claims

You'r=
e claiming:

12 comprehensive lesson plans

24 discussion frameworks

PDF lesson packets

PowerPoint presentations

Assessment templates

Do these exist?

If YES:
 Great! Make sure they're all downloadable and properly =
formatted.

If NO:
 You have two options:

Create them
 (1=
-2 weeks of focused work)

Adjust the numbers
 to match what actually exists

Don't overpromise.
 Better to say "3 complete lesson plans with =
more coming" than "12 comprehensive lesson plans" that don't exist yet.

Priority 3: Case Study Pages Need Content

Let m=
e check if individual case studies have actual content:

2 st=
eps

site:symbi.world =
case studies surprise button adventure

=
0 results

=

Acknowledged inability to verify; pivoted tow=
ard constructive feedback.

I can't directly verify the case study pages, so I'll =
base my feedback on what I can see and give actionable advice.

I can't directly check individual case study pages, but here's what y=
ou need:

For EACH of the 11 case studies, you need:

Minimum (Launch-Ready):

Executive summary (2-3 paragrap=
hs)

"What Happened" narrative (5-10=
 paragraphs)

"Why It Matters" section

3-5 discussion questions

Link to download full case stud=
y PDF

Ideal (Professional-Ready):

Everything above PLUS:

Multiple interpretation framewo=
rks

Classroom activities

Assessment rubrics

ure all 11 case studies have at minimum the "Minimum" content

Next 2 weeks:
 =
Add "Ideal" content to top 5 most important cases

Month 2:
 Compl=
ete all 11 to "Ideal" standard

nload something.
