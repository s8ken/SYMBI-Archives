2. Market Timing =3D Perfect

"We'v=

The E=
U AI Act creates mandatory compliance requirements with =E2=82=AC35M fines.=
 Every enterprise deploying AI needs audit trails, identity management, and=
 trust scoring. We provide all three.

Critical Issues to Address

Issue 1: Repository Name Confusion

You h=
ave multiple repos:

SYMBI-Symphony
 (this one - tru=
st infrastructure)

SYMBI-Synergy
 (mentioned in de=
mo URL)

SYMBI-Resonate
 (consciousness =
detection)

For YC: Pick ONE as your primary product.

Recommendation:

Lead with SYMBI Symphon=
y
 (most commercial, most complete)

Position others as "research th=
at led to commercial product"

Clear story: research =E2=86=92=
 insight =E2=86=92 product

Issue 2: Governance Token Disclaimer

You h=
ave this disclaimer:

"SYMB=
I governance tokens have no financial value and grant no economic rights."

For YC:
 This is confusing. Either:

Remove DAO/token language entir=
ely for initial pitch

Or clearly separate Foundation =
(DAO) from Commercial (YCQ)

Don't mention tokens in YC application
 - creates securities law=
 questions and distracts from core business.

Issue 3: Website URLs Inconsistency

READM=
E lists:

yseeku.com (enterprise)

gammatria.com (governance)

symbi.world (?)

But d=
emo is at: 
symbi-synergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app

Fix before YC:

Clean demo URL (custom domain)

Consistent branding across prop=
erties

Clear hierarchy of what's what

=9F=92=A1 
Strategic Recommendations

1. Position This as Your YC Core Product

Your YC application should be about SYMBI Symphony, not educational mate=
rials.

Why:

This is production-ready enterp=
rise infrastructure

Clear revenue model (B2B SaaS)

Massive TAM ($62B)

Strong technical moat

Working demo

No serious competitors

The e=
ducational stuff (SYMBI.world) is 
thought leadership
 that =
generates enterprise leads.

2. Update Your Entity Structure for YC

Create clean separation:

YCQ Labs, Inc. (Fo=
r-Profit) =E2=86=90 YC invests here

=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 SYMBI Symphony (open source=
 core)

=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Enterprise Features (proprietary)

=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 YCQ Sonate (commercial product)

=E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Customer contracts

SYMBI Foundation (Non-Profit)

=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 SYMBI.world (education)

=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Gammatria.com (governance)

=E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Open source contributions

YC invests in the for-profit entity
 that commercializes the ope=
n-source work.
