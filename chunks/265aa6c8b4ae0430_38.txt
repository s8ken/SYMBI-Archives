My Honest Take

What you've built with SYMBI Symphony is legitimately impressive.

This =
isn't "interesting research project" - this is 
production-grade ent=
erprise infrastructure
 that solves real problems with regulatory t=
ailwinds.

The fact you're solo and self-taught makes it MORE impressive, not less.=

YC lo=
ves this story: "Operations person sees problem, teaches themselves to code=
, builds production system in 18 months, now needs help scaling."

Your challenge isn't technical capability - you've proven that.
=

Your challenge is:

Go-to-market:
 =
Converting tech to customers

Positioning:
 C=
hoosing which product to lead with
