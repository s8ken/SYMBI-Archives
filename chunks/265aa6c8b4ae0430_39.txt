Core Product Questions

What is your company going to make?

YCQ L=
abs has built 
SYMBI Symphony
 - the first production-ready,=
 W3C-compliant trust infrastructure for enterprise AI systems.

The Problem:

The EU AI Act (effective 2025-2027) requires enterprises to prove their AI =
systems are trustworthy, transparent, and accountable - with fines up to =
=E2=82=AC35M for non-compliance. Current solutions don't exist. Companies n=
eed:
=E2=80=A2 Decentralized identity for AI agents
=E2=80=A2 Verifiable trust credentials
=E2=80=A2 Cryptographic audit trails
=E2=80=A2 Privacy-preserving revocation
=E2=80=A2 Real-time compliance reporting

Exist=
ing "solutions" are either academic projects (not production-ready) or prop=
rietary black boxes (no standards compliance).

Our Solution:

SYMBI Symphony provides W3C-standards-based infrastructure:

1. Decentralized Identity (DIDs)

=E2=80=A2 4 W3C methods: did:web, did:key, did:ethr, did:ion
=E2=80=A2 No vendor lock-in - portable across providers
=E2=80=A2 <50ms average resolution, 95% cache hit rate

2. Verifiable Credentials

=E2=80=A2 6-pillar trust scoring (compliance, ethics, transparency, etc.)
=E2=80=A2 Portable, cryptographically verifiable
=E2=80=A2 Quantifiable trust metrics for AI behavior

3. Privacy-Preserving Revocation

=E2=80=A2 Status List 2021 (W3C standard)
=E2=80=A2 128,000 credentials =E2=86=92 16KB (87.5% compression)
=E2=80=A2 Zero-knowledge checks (no credential enumeration)

4. Enterprise Key Management

=E2=80=A2 AWS KMS, GCP Cloud KMS integration
=E2=80=A2 HSM-backed signing (FIPS 140-2 Level 3)
=E2=80=A2 Multi-region support, automatic rotation

5. Cryptographic Audit Trails

=E2=80=A2 Every AI interaction signed and chained
=E2=80=A2 Tamper-evident (blockchain-style hashing)
=E2=80=A2 Queryable by time, actor, event, severity
=E2=80=A2 Valid
