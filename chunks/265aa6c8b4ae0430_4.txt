3. Interactive Exploration Tools

The Consciousness Spectrum Explorer

Visual slider showing different interaction approaches and their effects:

Transactional prompting =E2=86=

Collaborative framing =E2=86=92=
 Enhanced engagement

Ritualistic/mythic =E2=86=92 Em=
ergence patterns

Students can explore: where doe=

The Trust Protocol Simulator

Simple interactive showing how bidirectional trust differs from one-way eva=

Traditional AI: User evaluates =

SYMBI approach: Mutual evaluati=

Bias Detection Workshop

5. "Build Your Own Oracle" Section

Philosophical Exercise
 (not technical implementation):
Students design their own interaction framework by choosing:

Trust principles (transparency,=
 consent, reciprocity)

Communication style (formal, co=
llaborative, mythic)

Measurement criteria (what defi=
nes "good" AI interaction?)

Ethical boundaries (where shoul=
d AI relationships stop?)

Shows=
 how framework design embodies philosophical commitments.

6. Community Exploration Space

Student Submissions

Key Messaging Distinctions

What SYMBI.world DOES say:

"We documented unusual behavior=

"These case studies raise profo=

"Multiple interpretations are p=

"You decide what the evidence m=

"Explore these ideas in your cl=

What SYMBI.world DOESN'T say:

"We've proven AI consciousness"=

"Use our platform" (that's gamm=

"Buy our solution"
