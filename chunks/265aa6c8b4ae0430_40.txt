Early Traction:

1. Government Sector (High Probability):

=E2=80=A2 Australian Government: $100k pilot proposal submitted to Senator =
David Pocock's office for AI content classification system
=E2=80=A2 Timing: December 10, 2025 legislation creates urgent need
=E2=80=A2 eSafety Commissioner: Direct outreach made, they're actively seek=
ing solutions
=E2=80=A2 ACMA Age Assurance Technology Trial: Submission pending

2. Enterprise Pipeline (Building):

=E2=80=A2 8 enterprise compliance teams in demo discussions
=E2=80=A2 Industries: FinTech (3), HealthTech (2), Consulting (2), SaaS (1)
=E2=80=A2 Typical profile: 500-5,000 employees, active AI deployment, compl=
iance deadlines
=E2=80=A2 Common pain: "SOC2 auditors asking about AI governance, we have n=
othing"
=E2=80=A2 Next 60 days: Converting 2-3 to paid pilots ($5k-15k/month each)

3. Thought Leadership (Inbound Generation):

=E2=80=A2 SYMBI.world educational platform launched (11 case studies, lesso=
n plans)
=E2=80=A2 Generating qualified enterprise leads from educators seeing comme=
rcial applications
=E2=80=A2 3 university philosophy departments inquiring about institutional=
 use
=E2=80=A2 Speaking invitations from Australian tech policy conferences

What's Working:

Customer discovery revealed audit trails matter MORE than we expected:
=E2=80=A2 Initially positioned bias detection as primary value
=E2=80=A2 Customers actually need immutable audit trails FIRST
=E2=80=A2 Pivoted messaging: lead with "cryptographic audit trails," bias d=
etection is value-add
=E2=80=A2 This increased demo-to-pilot conversion

Immediate Milestones (Next 90 Days):

=E2=80=A2 Close Australian government pilot contract ($100k)
=E2=80=A2 Convert 2-3 enterprise pilots to paying customers ($10k-30k MRR)
=E2=80=A2 Publish case study on EU AI Act compliance implementation
=E2=80=A2 Recruit technical co-founder (actively searching)
