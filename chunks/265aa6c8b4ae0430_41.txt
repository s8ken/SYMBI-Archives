Founder Questions

Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-=
computer) system to your advantage.

Context:
 2019, managing operations for enterprise using 5 diffe=
rent AI vendors (chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis, image recogniti=
on, recommendations). Each vendor insisted their integration was "standard"=
 but used completely different formats. IT estimated 6-month integration pr=
oject. Business needed it in 6 weeks.

The System Problem:

Vendors deliberately made integration complex to create switching costs. Ea=
ch had:
=E2=80=A2 Different authentication (OAuth, API keys, custom headers)
=E2=80=A2 Different data formats (JSON, XML, protobuf)
=E2=80=A2 Different error handling
=E2=80=A2 Different rate limits
=E2=80=A2 Artificial complexity to prevent multi-vendor strategies

The Hack:

I realized they all used HTTP + JSON at the core - just wrapped in complexi=
ty theater.

Bui=
lt "Universal Translator" in 2 weeks:
=E2=80=A2 Created abstraction layer normalizing all vendors to single inter=
nal format
=E2=80=A2 Used their own documentation against them (publicly documented, j=
ust obscured)
=E2=80=A2 Deployed without IT approval initially (ask forgiveness not permi=
ssion)
=E2=80=A2 When it worked perfectly, IT adopted as official solution
=E2=80=A2 Used pre-ChatGPT AI tools to help (Claude 1.0 for documentation p=
arsing)

The Outcome:

=E2=80=A2 6-month $500k project =E2=86=92 2-week $0 solution
=E2=80=A2 Could switch vendors in <1 day instead of 3-month migration
=E2=80=A2 Actually DID switch 2 vendors who raised prices (leverage restore=
d)
=E2=80=A2 Saved company ~$500k in integration costs
=E2=80=A2 This experience directly led to SYMBI S
