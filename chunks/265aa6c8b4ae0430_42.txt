The Lesson:

Complex systems are often artificially complex to create vendor lock-in. Fi=
nd the underlying simplicity, abstract it, give users power back.

Why This Matters for SYMBI:

AI trust infrastructure is having the same problem today:
=E2=80=A2 Every AI provider wants lock-in
=E2=80=A2 Proprietary "trust" systems that don't interoperate
=E2=80=A2 Enterprises stuck with one vendor
=E2=80=A2 We're building the abstraction layer (using W3C standards)
=E2=80=A2 Enterprises get control back

This =
isn't just my origin story - it's our competitive moat. I see the lock-in g=
ame because I lived it. SYMBI Symphony is the standardized abstraction laye=
r the industry needs but vendors don't want to build.

Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of cl=
ass or work, that two or more of you created together.

Current Status: Solo Founder (Actively Addressing)

I kno=
w solo founders are YC's least favorite scenario. Here's the honest situati=
on and what I'm doing about it:

Why Solo Currently:

=E2=80=A2 Problem emerged from unique operations experience (hard to find s=
omeone with same insight)
=E2=80=A2 Taught myself to code while building (18 months: zero experience =
=E2=86=92 43k lines production code)
=E2=80=A2 Mission-driven focus meant prioritizing working product over perf=
ect team initially
=E2=80=A2 Operations background =3D used to executing solo until right pers=
on emerges

Evidence I Can Collaborate:

1. 18-Month Cross-Platform AI Research Project

While technically solo development, this involved systematic collaboration =
with 7 different AI systems (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity,=
 Replit, Ninja AI):
=E2=80=A2 Documented 161,789 words of structured interactions
=E2=80=A2 Statistical analysis showing reproducible patterns (p<0.001)
=E2=80=A2 Treated AI systems as research collaborators, not just tools
=E2=80=A2 This "weird" approach produced the insight that became the busine=
ss

Uncon=
ventional framing but true: collaborative research methodology across distr=
ibuted systems produced commercial breakthrough.

2. SYMBI.world Educational Platform

Built through iteration with global educator community:
=E2=80=A2 Interviewed 20+ philosophy professors about teaching needs
=E2=80=A2 Developed 11 case studies based on classroom feedback
=E2=80=A2 Open-sourced materials for community improvement (MIT/CC-BY licen=
sed)
=E2=80=A2 Building distributed network of educators testing and refining fr=
ameworks
=E2=80=A2 Generated commercial leads from academic collaboration

3. W3C Standards Implementation

Successfully collaborated with:
=E2=80=A2 W3C specification documents (precise implementation)
=E2=80=A2 Open source communities (crypto libraries, DID methods)
=E2=80=A2 Test vector authors (RFC/NIST validation)
=E2=80=A2 95 passing tests prove ability to collaborate with distributed st=
andards bodies

Technical Co-Founder Search (Active):

Ideal Profile:

=E2=80=A2 Full-stack engineer with B2B SaaS experience
=E2=80=A2 Believes in responsible AI development (mission alignment critica=
l)
=E2=80=A2 Comfortable with government/enterprise customers (not just tech s=
tartups)
=E2=80=A2 Can lead engineering team as we scale
=E2=80=A2 Complements my strengths: I architect/build/sell, they scale/opti=
mize/lead eng

Where I'm Looking:

=E2=80=A2 W3C/DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation) community
=E2=80=A2 Cryptography engineering circles
=E2=80=A2 Former enterprise infrastructure engineers
=E2=80=A2 People who care about standards, not just growth hacking

YC Specific Ask:

Help me find the right technical co-founder match.
 The YC =
network would be invaluable here. I need someone who:
=E2=80=A2 Respects the mission (not just chasing exit)
=E2=80=A2 Understands enterprise/government sales (not just B2C growth)
=E2=80=A2 Values engineering excellence (our 95% test coverage matters)
=E2=80=A2 Can commit long-term (not just looking for quick flip)
