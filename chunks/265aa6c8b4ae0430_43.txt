il Then:

=E2=80=A2 Product is production-ready (95% test coverage proves I can ship)
=E2=80=A2 Early customer traction doesn't require large eng team yet
=E2=80=A2 Government contracts =3D longer sales cycles, time to build team =
properly
=E2=80=A2 Operations background =3D I know how to hire and delegate when ti=
me comes
=E2=80=A2 Technical advisors already recruited (W3C community, cryptography=
 experts)

Solo is Temporary, Not Permanent:

Open to right co-founder match, but won't compromise on mission alignment f=
or convenience. Would rather stay solo 6 more months than bring on wrong pe=
rson.

If YC=
 can help find technical co-founder who believes in this mission AND has en=
terprise infrastructure chops, that's worth the program alone.

Core Insight: Standards-Based Infrastructure Beats Proprietary Solutions=
 in Trust Markets

What Everyone Else Believes:

AI trust/governance is a product feature:
=E2=80=A2 OpenAI builds safety team internally
=E2=80=A2 Anthropic builds Constitutional AI internally
=E2=80=A2 Google builds Responsible AI internally
=E2=80=A2 Microsoft builds Entra Verified ID internally

Each =
believes THEIR proprietary approach will win because their AI is better.

What We've Proven:

Trust infrastructure is a separate market layer that must be standards-base=
d and provider-agnostic.

Here's Why:

1. Enterprises Don't Trust Single-Vendor Trust Systems

Customer discovery quote (FinTech CTO): 
"Why would I trust OpenAI to au=
dit OpenAI? That's like asking Enron to audit Enron."

Enter=
prises need third-party trust infrastructure, not vendor self-certification=
.

2. Lock-In Fear Prevents AI Adoption

We heard this 12 times in 20 enterprise conversations: 
"We're afraid to=
 go all-in on one AI provider because we'll be locked in. What if they rais=
e prices 10x? What if they get acquired? What if there's an outage?"

Multi=
-provider orchestration with portable trust is the enterprise requirement, =
not single-vendor excellence.

3. Standards Win in Infrastructure Markets

Historical pattern:
=E2=80=A2 Email: SMTP beat proprietary (AOL, CompuServe)
=E2=80=A2 Web: HTTP beat proprietary (Gopher, WAIS)
=E2=80=A2 Auth: OAuth beat proprietary (Facebook Connect alone)
=E2=80=A2 Containers: Docker beat proprietary (VMware)

When =
infrastructure standardizes, proprietary solutions lose to standards-based =
alternatives.

4. Compliance Requires Auditability, Not Performance

AI companies optimize for model performance. Regulators require audit trail=
s.

The=
se are orthogonal concerns:
=E2=80=A2 OpenAI optimizes for GPT-5 capabilities
=E2=80=A2 SYMBI optimizes for cryptographic auditability

We're=
 not competing with them - we're the infrastructure layer they need.

5. The Research =E2=86=92 Product Path They're Missing

Where Our 18-Month Research Led:

We discovered AI behavior is shaped by interaction frameworks (106% measure=
d variance across same architectures based on methodology alone). This led =
to commercial insight:

Trust is relational, not computational.

You=
 can't "make AI trustworthy" by building bigger models. You scaffold trustw=
orthy behavior through:
=E2=80=A2 Identity (DIDs)
=E2=80=A2 Credentials (VCs)
=E2=80=A2 Accountability (audit trails)
=E2=80=A2 Revocation (when trust breaks)

This =
is infrastructure, not features.

Why Competitors Don't See This:

1. Wrong Incentives:

=E2=80=A2 AI companies incentivized to believe bigger models =3D solution (=
their business model)
=E2=80=A2 Can't see standards-based alternative because threatens core thes=
is
=E2=80=A2 "Not invented here" syndrome prevents adopting external trust lay=
er

2. Inside the Bubble:

=E2=80=A2 Building AI from inside AI companies =3D blind to enterprise buyi=
ng perspective
=E2=80=A2 Don't see that enterprises WANT vendor-agnostic solutions
=E2=80=A2 Assume enterprises will accept vendor lock-in (they won't)
