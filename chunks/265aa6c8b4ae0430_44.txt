ic vs. Commercial:

=E2=80=A2 Academic projects (like Veramo, DIF) build for completeness, not =
enterprise needs
=E2=80=A2 Missing: KMS integration, compliance reporting, performance bench=
marks, support
=E2=80=A2 We built for enterprises from day one (operations background adva=
ntage)

4. Misunderstanding Government Market:

=E2=80=A2 Tech companies assume government wants cutting-edge AI
=E2=80=A2 Wrong: Governments want boring reliability, explainable systems, =
audit trails
=E2=80=A2 Our W3C compliance + audit trails =3D perfect government fit
=E2=80=A2 They're chasing innovation, we're providing accountability

The Bigger Thesis:

We're not building better AI. We're building the trust layer ALL AI need=
s.

Thi=
nk about infrastructure analogies:
=E2=80=A2 Stripe isn't a bank, it's payment infrastructure for all banks
=E2=80=A2 Datadog isn't an app, it's monitoring infrastructure for all apps
=E2=80=A2 AWS isn't software, it's compute infrastructure for all software

SYMBI isn't AI, it's trust infrastructure for all AI.

As =
AI proliferates, every enterprise will need:
=E2=80=A2 Identity management for AI agents
=E2=80=A2 Trust scoring and credentials
=E2=80=A2 Audit trails for compliance
=E2=80=A2 Revocation when things go wrong

We're=
 building the infrastructure layer. AI companies can stay focused on making=
 better models. We'll handle the trust.

Why This Insight Matters Strategically:

While=
 AI companies spend billions making models bigger, we're building the infra=
structure layer that works across ALL models. As they scale, we benefit. We=
 don't compete with OpenAI - we enable enterprises to use OpenAI safely.

This =
is $62B market opportunity that AI companies are ignoring because it doesn'=
t fit their "better models =3D better AI" narrative.

We se=
e it because we came from operations, not AI research. We know what enterpr=
ises actually need vs. what AI researchers think they need.

How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
