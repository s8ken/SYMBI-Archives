Path to $1B+ Valuation:

At Ye=
ar 5 ($180M ARR):
=E2=80=A2 SaaS multiples: 8-12x revenue
=E2=80=A2 Infrastructure companies: 10-15x revenue

=E2=80=A2 At 10x: $1.8B valuation

What Gets Us There:

1. Network Effects:

=E2=80=A2 More customers =3D better behavioral baselines
=E2=80=A2 Better baselines =3D better trust scoring
=E2=80=A2 Better scoring =3D more valuable product
=E2=80=A2 Flywheel effect

2. High Switching Costs:

=E2=80=A2 Audit trails =3D historical data lock-in
=E2=80=A2 Trust credentials =3D identity lock-in
=E2=80=A2 Compliance certifications =3D regulatory lock-in
=E2=80=A2 <5% annual churn expected

3. Expansion Revenue:

=E2=80=A2 Start with compliance use case
=E2=80=A2 Expand to multi-provider orchestration
=E2=80=A2 Expand to AI agent marketplace
=E2=80=A2 Expand to zero-knowledge proofs
=E2=80=A2 Land-and-expand model

=E2=80=A2 SOC2 for AI becoming standard
=E2=80=A2 AI adoption accelerating (more customers)
=E2=80=A2 Regulatory expansion (more jurisdictions)

5. Category Creation:

=E2=80=A2 We're defining "AI Trust Infrastructure" category
=E2=80=A2 First-mover advantage in nascent space
=E2=80=A2 Similar to Datadog creating "observability" category
=E2=80=A2 Category leaders capture 60%+ of market

Why This Is Achievable:

=E2=
=80=A2 Working product today (not 2-year buildout)
=E2=80=A2 Clear technical moat (W3C standards implementation barrier)
=E2=80=A2 Regulatory forcing function (customers must buy)
=E2=80=A2 Enterprise sales motion (predictable, high-value)
=E2=80=A2 SaaS economics (high margin, recurring)

Conservative scenario: $75M ARR Year 5 =3D $750M valuation

Aggressive scenario: $300M ARR Year 5 =3D $3B valuation
