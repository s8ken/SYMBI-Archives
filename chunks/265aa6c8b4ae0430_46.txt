Our Unique Position:

We're the only solution that's BOTH:
=E2=80=A2 Production-ready with working demo
=E2=80=A2 AND W3C standards-compliant
=E2=80=A2 AND AI-specific
=E2=80=A2 AND provider-agnostic
=E2=80=A2 AND open source core

What They Don't Understand:

Veramo/DIF:
 Think standards compliance is enough. Miss that ent=
erprises need production features, support, and compliance positioning.

Microsoft/Trinsic:
 Think proprietary =3D competitive moat. Miss=
 that enterprises fear lock-in in trust infrastructure.

AI Providers:
 Think trust is a feature of their models. Miss th=
at enterprises need third-party auditable trust layer.

Generic Compliance:
 Think AI is just another compliance checkbo=
x. Miss that AI requires cryptographic audit trails and identity management=
.

We understand:
 Trust infrastructure must be standards-based, pr=
ovider-agnostic, and cryptographically verifiable - but also production-rea=
dy, enterprise-supported, and commercially viable.

Why We'll Win:

1. Technical Head Start:
 18 months building while competitors f=
ocused elsewhere

2. Standards Compliance:
 W3C gives us defensible positioni=
ng (hard to replicate)

3. Market Timing:
 EU AI Act forces market creation, we're =
ready

4. Open Source Strategy:
 Reduces vendor lock-in fear, buil=
ds trust

5. AI-Native:
 Built for AI from day one, not bolted on
