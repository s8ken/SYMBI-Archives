What It Does

Provides double-blind, cryptographically verified compa=
rison of AI models across 5 proprietary dimensions:

-

**

Reality Index

**

 - Factual accuracy

-

**

Trust Protocol

Why It Matters

Enterprises spend $10k-100k/month on AI without objecti=
ve comparison data. SYMBI Resonate provides:

-

 Quantified model selection criteria

-

 EU AI Act compliance reporting

-

 Real-time quality monitoring

-

 Competitive benchmarking

**2. Create Standalone Demo Page**

- Host the full trial demonstration document

- Add visualizations (radar charts showing 5 dimensions)

- Include downloadable PDF report

- Link from GitHub README

**3. Record Demo Video (3 minutes)**

**Script:**

```

0:00-0:30: "Should you use Claude or GPT-4? Let me show=
 you how we answer that scientifically."

0:30-1:00: Show double-blind setup

"We create anonymous Slot A and Slot B. No one knows which mod=
el is which."

1:00-1:30: Show responses side-by-side

"Here's how each model answered the same question about consci=
ousness."

1:30-2:15: Show SYMBI scoring breakdown

"Our 5-dimension framework evaluates Reality Index, Trust Prot=
ocol, Ethical Alignment, Resonance Quality, and Canvas Parity.

Notice: Slot A excels in ethics (9.6). Slot B excels in factua=
l accuracy (9.1)."

2:15-2:45: Reveal results

"Slot A is Claude: 8.87 overall. Slot B is GPT-4: 8.60 overall=
.

This is statistically significant with 95% confidence."

2:45-3:00: Call to action
