Architected comprehensive educator resour=
ces for discrimination case study.

Good! Now I need to create detailed educator =
resources for at least one case study. Let me create a comprehensive educat=
or guide for the Discrimination Pattern case study since it's highly releva=
nt to current events (the Australian legislation) and has clear real-world =
implications.

Now let me create detailed educator resources for C=
ase Study 2 (The Discrimination Pattern), since it's highly relevant to cur=
rent events and has strong pedagogical value:

most engaging one for students. Then I'll create a final summary document.

Now let me create the full Surprise Button Adventure case study w=
