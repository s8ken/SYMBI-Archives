=9DSSY)=E2=80=9D
, which looks like weird letters =E2=80=94 you=E2=
=80=99re wondering if this is some 
crypto scam, meme coin logo, or malware
 that=E2=80=99s somehow=
 on your brand-new phone.

=E2=9C=85 
Good news:

No, this isn=E2=80=99t a meme coin or scam. It=E2=80=99s not a crypto logo,=
 a virus, or anything shady.

It=E2=80=99s 
just your phone=E2=
=80=99s default startup screen
, with text garbled because it hasn=
=E2=80=99t yet loaded the proper language settings.

=F0=9F=94=8D Why it looks weird

When a phone is fresh from the facto=
ry, it starts up in a 
default s=
ystem locale
, which could be:

an incomplete 
multi-language placeholder
,

a 
Myanmar (Burmese) script fallback
 (those squiggly letter=
s you see), or

leftover debug language tags.

The phone 
is literally waiting for you to pick your language
 so it=
 can show everything in English.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Here=E2=80=99s what to=
 do right now

Since you said:

I haven=E2=80=99t even got that far

you=E2=80=99re still on the very fi=
rst screen.

Just do this:

Tap the red 
=E2=80=9CStart=E2=80=9D
 button in the lowe=
r right corner.

The next screen will almost certai=
nly be the 
language selector
, where you=E2=80=99ll see a list like:

scss

Copy code

English (United States)
Espa=C3=B1

ol

 (Espa=C3=B1a)
Fran=C3=A7ais (France)
...

Pick your language there.

Once you pick 
English
, all menus will be normal.

=F0=9F=92=A1 
Short answer:

=E2=9C=85 This is 
not a meme =
coin
 or a hacked phone.

=E2=9C=85 It=E2=80=99s just a 
brand-new phone that needs you to set the language.

Once you do, all the strange letters will disappear.

If you want, send me a picture of the 
next screen after you tap =E2=80=9CStart=E2=80=9D
, and I=E2=80=99ll help you pick the right option step by step.

Want to try? Let=E2=80=99s do it together. =F0=9F=96=A4

Perfect =E2=80=94 that actually cle=

=E2=9C=85 The strange =E2=80=9CCWY (=
=E1=80=98=E1=81=A0 TG=E1=80=82=E1=80=B7=E1=80=9D=E1=80=9D~ =E1=81=B5=E1=80=
=9DSSY)=E2=80=9D you saw is just 
another language option
, probably a corrupted display of somethi=
ng like Burmese, Lao, or an obscure locale due to missing fonts.

When you say:

"It came up as suggested along with English"

that means your phone is simply 
showing multiple suggested language=
s
 at startup. The text is garbled for one of them, but that's 
completely normal on some imported =
or multi-region builds
 (Motorola does this on certain global varia=
nts).

=F0=9F=92=A1 Bottom line

=E2=9C=85 
It is not malware, not a meme coin, not hacked.

It=E2=80=99s just the phone offering setup in:

=F0=9F=87=AC=F0=9F=87=A7 
English
, and

a second language (whose characters =
aren=E2=80=99t properly rendering on your phone right now).

=F0=9F=9A=80 What to do

Just pick 
English
, continue with the setup, and you=E2=80=
=99ll never see that weird text again.

If you want, we can do a quick 
sanity check
:

=F0=9F=91=89 After you set up, go to:

nginx

Copy code

Settings

 > =
About phone

and I=E2=80=99ll help you confirm:=

The model number

Android version

Security patch

to ensure everything is legit.

Want to do that together? Just say so =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ve go=
t you. =F0=9F=96=A4
