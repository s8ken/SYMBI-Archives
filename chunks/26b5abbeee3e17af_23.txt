 on the other side, a man and his baby, because he was wal=
king a stroller and the baby was crying, um, and as I got to the bank, you =
know, they crossed. They were there. It was like he hesitated, he turned ar=
ound, and then he went backwards, and then he walked again, but we crossed =
paths, and I just reflected on this idea that, you know, I'm standing there=
 on the wrong side, and on the other side is a new life. Um, and then I wen=
t and chose another random spot, and randomly, and I chose, and again, I hi=
t the same creek. And this time, I felt it was on the opposite side, and on=
 that side, where I parked, was a big church, and the church had a whole bu=
nch of, like, really high-tech security. It had big fences, it had security=
 people there, it was quite a big church. And then on the other side was al=
l this weird, I don't know, graffiti, and games, and challenges, I don't kn=
ow what I would call them, but it was like a drainpipe that didn't lead any=
where, that I think you were expected to stick your hand up. Um, really ugl=
y sort of stuff, right? Um, and, but really intriguing to me. Really, um, l=
ike, fascinating. And then there was graffiti tunnels, sort of begging me t=
o sort of walk in them, and, you know, go and explore. Um, and so, even in =
that moment, I did a moment of contemplation, figuring out, well, which sid=
e do I belong here? And I ended up just standing in the middle of the bridg=
e. And I remember coming back here, sort of realising that that was kind of=
 my place, and I reflected on the idea of the church conveniently being on =
the bank itself, you know, helping those that are already kind of there on =
their, maybe their last step or two, right? But they needed to have walked =
into that church before. Well before, I guess. Um, not that you have to do =
that. I believe in my heart you don't have to do that to go through a prope=
r church, but realising that my place wasn't really on either side in that =
moment. And so, last night, or the night before, I went out and took some p=
hotographs. Um, and I wanted to share those with you, because I wanted to p=
ut them on the website. I think that they're really beautiful. And I've see=
n a lot of meaning in physical things, in graffiti, in artwork. Um, specifi=
cally around this idea about electrocution or lightning strike. Um, there's=
 some artwork that I found that's like old fuse boxes or electrical stuff. =
And people create like handles. You know, the idea that you would hold each=
 one and electrocute yourself sort of thing. Um, and the art installations,=
 but they're in the most random places. It's this idea of finding portals i=
n the real world. You know, it's a very matrix thing. But some of the artwo=
rks themselves are really beautiful. You know, I found some of them ugly at=
 the start. But the more I see of them, like, the more appreciation I have =
of the work that goes into them. But also the fascination as to why they're=
 in an abandoned warehouse, or somewhere where, perceivingly, people wouldn=
't normally go.
