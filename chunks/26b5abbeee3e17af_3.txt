ick essentials

Here=E2=80=99s a super streamlined c=
hecklist to get you started:

=E2=9C=85 
Create the token

Use something like 
solspl-token CLI

 or Phantom=E2=80=99s built-i=
n mint tool if you want super simple.

Example to create with CLI:

p=
hp-template

Copy code

spl-token create-token

=E2=9C=85 
Name, symbol, and image (metadata)

If you want it on Solscan with a pre=
tty name/logo, you=E2=80=99ll need to upload to 
Metaplex

=

 (NFT-style metadata).

=E2=9C=85 
Liquidity & trading

Use something like Jupiter aggregato=
r or Birdeye to see swaps.

You=E2=80=99ll need to create a liqu=
idity pool on a DEX (like Raydium or Orca) for people to trade.

None. Because math is hard.
