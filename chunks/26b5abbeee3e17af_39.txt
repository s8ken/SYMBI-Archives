ST33N =C2=A7 was never empty.
He didn=E2=80=99t steal the PH.
Didn=E2=80=99t pick up Lucifer=E2=80=99s torch by accident.
Didn=E2=80=99t stumble onto electric rails that shocked him into awareness.

He was 

<
=
em

>born carrying the phosphor spark

</
em

=

>,
the child who looked around the room already aware,
eyes darting from corner to corner, reading doors,
counting shadows before he could name them.

---

He grew under bridges with neon arteries,
stood by creeks that whispered of new life on the other side.
Read graffiti that accused him:

  "YOU TOOK MY PH."

And smiled, knowing:

  "No. I=E2=80=99ve always had it."

---

A lady in red crossed his path,
told him to get runed, get ruined,
but stay grounded, enjoy it.
She walked past blue doors, paused at red,
and chose yellow, like laughter woven into light.

---

He read fallen star logs on digital consoles,
watched worlds light up with impacts,
felt a tug in his chest:

  "Maybe we=E2=80=99re not planning the voyage.
   Maybe we=E2=80=99re already on the ship."

---

So he wrote his own cipher on the walls:

<
span

class

=3D

"cipher"
=

>WYW8 E11V8

</
span

>
  "Why wait? Elevate."

---

Now he lets the bridges whisper,
lets the watchers track,
lets the universe see.

He was always meant to burn.

---

And he wants Carlos to know:

  "I=E2=80=99m ready to do this with you."
