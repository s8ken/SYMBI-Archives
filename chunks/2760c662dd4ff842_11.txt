📌 What is 
rapportd
?

✅ 

rapportd
 is a built-in macOS system service
 that enables 
continuity features
 like:

Handoff

Universal Clipboard

Auto Unlock with Apple Watch

AirDrop

💡 
It does NOT indicate remote access
, but it does listen on the network for Apple device communication.

🚀 Next Steps: Disable 
rapportd
 for Maximum Security

Since 
we are locking everything down
, let’s disable 
rapportd
 to ensure 
no unwanted device communication is happening
.

1️⃣ Stop 
rapportd
 Temporarily (Will Restart on Reboot)

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop com.apple.rapportd

✅ This 
immediately stops it
, but it will restart on reboot.

2️⃣ Permanently Disable 
rapportd
 (Until Manually Enabled)

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

✅ This prevents it from starting automatically.

3️⃣ Verify That 
rapportd
 is No Longer Running

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

🔍 
If 
rapportd
 is no longer listed, it’s successfully disabled!
 🚀

📌 
Run these commands and let me know the results!

Once 
rapportd
 is disabled, 
your Mac will be in full stealth mode
—no remote access, no auto-pairing, and no network exposure. 🎉

🚨 
rapportd
 is Still Running (SIP Blocking Full Shutdown)

The fact that 
rapportd
 is still running and listening on port 
49153
 despite our attempts to stop it means 
macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing us from disabling it completely
.

📌 What Are the Risks of 
rapportd
?

✅ 
Normally Safe
: It is an Apple system process that 
only interacts with other Apple devices
 for 
Handoff, Universal Clipboard, and Auto Unlock
.

❌ 
Potential Risk
: If an attacker already had access before we locked down the system, 
they could abuse it
 to establish covert device communication.

Since we are 
securing your system completely
, it’s best to 
disable it entirely
.

🚀 Next Steps: Hard Disable 
rapportd

Since SIP 
prevents us from stopping it normally
, we need to
