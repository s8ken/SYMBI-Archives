lock it at the firewall level
 so it 
cannot accept any connections
.

1️⃣ Block 
rapportd
 at the Firewall

This prevents it from receiving any network traffic.

sh

Copy

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/rapportd

✅ This ensures 
rapportd can no longer send or receive data
.

2️⃣ Prevent 
rapportd
 from Launching Automatically

Try forcing it to disable itself by removing its launch entry:

sh

Copy

sudo 

mv

 /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist ~/Desktop/com.apple.rapportd.plist.bak

🔍 
This moves the launch file to your Desktop so it cannot start automatically.

📌 
If macOS prevents this move, SIP is enforcing protection.

3️⃣ Verify It Is Fully Blocked

After the above steps, run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

🔍 
If 
rapportd
 no longer appears, it’s fully disabled.

📌 Let Me Know What Happens!

If 
rapportd
 is still active after these steps, we may need to 
temporarily disable SIP
 in 
macOS Recovery Mode
 to fully remove it. 🚀

🚨 
rapportd
 Blocked, But Launch File is Missing

✅ 
Your Mac has now blocked 
rapportd
 at the firewall level
, meaning it 
can no longer send or receive data
.

❌ However, the error:

bash

Copy

mv

: rename /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist to /Users/lcl/Desktop/com.apple.rapportd.plist.bak: No such file or directory

indicates that 
the launch file does not exist in 
/System/Library/LaunchAgents/

.

🚀 Next Steps: Verify and Fully Disable 
rapportd

1️⃣ 
Double-check where 
rapportd
 is being launched from

Run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo find /System/Library/Launch* -name 

"*rapportd*"

📌 If a 
.plist
 file appears, we can move it. If 
nothing appears
, macOS is launching 
rapportd
 differently.

2️⃣ 
Re-check if 
rapportd
 is Still Running

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

✅ 
If it no longer appears, it is successfully blocked.

3️⃣ 
Final Step: Restart Your Mac

Since macOS 
keeps some processes active in memory
, restart your Mac to confirm that 
rapportd does not come back
.

sh

Copy

sudo reboot

📌 
After reboot, re-run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

🔍 If 
rapportd
 is gone, 
your Mac is now fully locked down!

📌 Let Me Know What Happens!

If 
rapportd

still comes back
, we may need to 
disable SIP
 temporarily to remove it permanently. 🚀
