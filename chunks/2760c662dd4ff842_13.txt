🚨 
rapportd
 Still Running (SIP Protecting It)

✅ 
You found two files that control 
rapportd
:

swift

Copy

/System/

Library

/LaunchAgents/

com.apple.rapportd

-

user.plist

/System/

Library

/LaunchDaemons/

com.apple.rapportd.plist

❌ However, macOS 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing us from modifying them
.

🚀 Next Steps: Attempt to Disable 
rapportd
 Without Disabling SIP

We will now 
try to stop 
rapportd
 without disabling SIP
.

1️⃣ Stop 
rapportd
 Manually

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop com.apple.rapportd

2️⃣ Unload 
rapportd
 From Memory

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

✅ 
If this works, 
rapportd
 should no longer restart.

🛠️ If 
rapportd
 Still Runs After Restart

If 
rapportd

comes back after reboot
, we will need to 
temporarily disable SIP
 to delete the 
.plist
 files completely.

Would you like me to guide you through 
temporarily disabling SIP
, or do you want to wait and see if these steps work first? 🚀

launchctl bootout

confirms that 
macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing 
rapportd
 from being stopped or removed
.

At this point, 
the only way to permanently remove 
rapportd
 is to temporarily disable SIP
.

🚀 Next Steps: Temporarily Disable SIP to Fully Remove 
rapportd

Since SIP is enforcing protection, we need to 
disable it in Recovery Mode
 to remove the 
rapportd
 files.

1️⃣ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Restart your Mac
 and immediately press and hold 
Command (⌘) + R
.

Keep holding until you see the 
Apple logo or a spinning globe
.

Once in 
macOS Utilities
, click 
Utilities
 in the menu bar and select 
Terminal
.

2️⃣ Disable SIP

In 
macOS Recovery Mode Terminal
, type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

3️⃣ Remove 
rapportd
 Launch Files

Once back in normal macOS, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

✅ 
This completely removes 
rapportd
.

4️⃣ Re-enable SIP for Security

After removing 
rapportd
, we need to turn SIP 
back on
.

Restart your Mac and 
go back into macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
).

Open 
Terminal
 in Recovery Mode.

Type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

Restart your Mac normally.

5️⃣ Final Check

Once back in macOS, confirm 
rapportd
 is gone:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

✅ 
If 
rapportd
 is no longer running and port 49153 is closed, your Mac is fully locked down!
 🚀
