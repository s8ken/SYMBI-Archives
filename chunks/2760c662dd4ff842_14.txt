e can 
remove 
rapportd
 completely
.

1️⃣ Force Unload and Remove 
rapportd

Run these 
one by one
 in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

✅ 
This fully removes 
rapportd
, so it cannot restart.

2️⃣ Verify 
rapportd
 is Gone

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

🔍 
If 
rapportd
 is no longer running and port 49153 is closed, it is successfully removed!

3️⃣ Re-enable SIP for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is confirmed gone, 
we must turn SIP back on
 to protect your system.

1️⃣ Restart your Mac and 
go back into macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
).

2️⃣ Open 
Terminal
 in Recovery Mode.

3️⃣ Type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

4️⃣ Restart your Mac normally.

✅ 
Your system will now be locked down with no remote access, AirPlay, or network connections!
 🚀

📌 
Let me know once these steps are done, and we’ll confirm everything is secure!

🚨 Read-Only File System Error: System Partition Still Protected

The error:

pgsql

Copy

rm: /

System

/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-

user

.plist: 

Read

-

only

 file 

system

rm: /

System

/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist: 

Read

only

 file 

system

means that 
your system partition is still protected in read-only mode
, even though SIP is disabled.

🚀 Next Steps: Remount System as Read/Write

Since macOS 
protects system files by making the root filesystem read-only
, we need to temporarily 
remount it as read/write
.

1️⃣ Remount the Root Filesystem

In 
Terminal
, run:

sh

Copy

sudo mount -uw /

✅ 
This will make the system writable so you can delete 
rapportd
.

2️⃣ Remove 
rapportd
 Again

Now, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

✅ 
This will fully remove 
rapportd
.

3️⃣ Verify That 
rapportd
 is Gone

Check if the service is still running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

✅ 
If 
rapportd
 does not show up, it’s successfully deleted!

4️⃣ Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed, restart into 
macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
) and turn SIP back on:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

🔒 
This locks your system back down while keeping 
rapportd
 permanently removed.

📌 
Try these steps and let me know the results!

🚨 macOS Blocking Root Filesystem Remounting

The error:

vbnet

Copy

mount_apfs:

 volume could 

not

 be mounted: Permission denied

mount:

 / failed 

with

66

means that even with 
SIP disabled
, macOS is still protecting the 
system partition
 from modifications. This happens because 
macOS Catalina and later (Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma)
 use 
a signed system volume (SSV)
 that 
remains read-only unless explicitly overridden.

🚀 Next Steps: Disable SSV to Modify System Files

To remove 
rapportd
, we need to 
disable the Signed System Volume (SSV)
 in 
macOS Recovery Mode
.

1️⃣ Boot Back into macOS Recovery Mode

Restart your Mac
 and immediately hold 
Command (⌘) + R
.

Keep holding until you see the 
Apple logo or a spinning
