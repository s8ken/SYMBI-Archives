.

Once in 
macOS Utilities
, click 
Utilities
 in the menu bar and select 
Terminal
.

2️⃣ Disable the Signed System Volume (SSV)

In the 
Recovery Mode Terminal
, type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Then 
restart your Mac normally
.

3️⃣ Remount the Root Filesystem as Read/Write

Now that 
SSV is disabled
, in 
normal macOS
, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo mount -uw /

✅ This will 
make the system writable
.

4️⃣ Remove 
rapportd
 Completely

Once the filesystem is writable, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

✅ This 
fully removes 
rapportd

, so it 
can never restart
.

5️⃣ Verify 
rapportd
 is Gone

Check that 
it's no longer running
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

✅ 
If no output appears, it’s successfully deleted!

6️⃣ Re-enable SIP & SSV for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is removed, restart into 
macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
) and 
turn everything back on
:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

Then 
restart normally
.

🚨 macOS Blocking Root Filesystem Modifications (Even with SIP Off)

The fact that 
mount -uw /

still fails
 even after disabling SIP and SSV suggests that 
macOS is enforcing additional security restrictions
.

At this point, we need to try 
one final method
:

🚀 Alternative Method: Boot into 1TR (One True Recovery) Mode

Newer macOS versions (Big Sur and later) sometimes require 
1TR (One True Recovery)
 mode instead of standard 
macOS Recovery Mode
.

1️⃣ Boot into 1TR (One True Recovery) Mode

Turn off your Mac completely
.

Press and hold the power button
 until you see 
"Loading Startup Options."

Click 
Options
 (⚙️) → 
Continue
.

When in 
macOS Utilities
, open 
Terminal
.

2️⃣ Disable SIP and Authenticated Root Again

In 
1TR Terminal
, type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Press 
Enter
 and 
restart normally
.

3️⃣ Remount the Filesystem as Read/Write

Once back in 
regular macOS
, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo mount -uw /

✅ 
If this works, we can now delete 
rapportd
.

4️⃣ Remove 
rapportd

Now, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

✅ 
If this succeeds, 
rapportd
 is permanently removed.

5️⃣ Re-enable SIP and SSV

Once 
rapportd
 is gone, 
re-enable security
 by rebooting into 
1TR mode
 and running:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

✅ This ensures your system is secure again.

📌 Let Me Know If This Works!

If 
mount -uw /

still doesn’t work after this
, we’ll need a 
deeper forensic analysis
 to determine why 
your system is enforcing extra restrictions
. 🚀

that's how I was loading terminal anyway?

Got it! If you were 
already using 1TR (One True Recovery) Mode
 and 
mount -uw /

still failed
, then macOS is enforcing additional security measures beyond SIP and SSV.

🚨 Why Is This Happening?

Sealed System Volume (SSV) Enforcement
 – Even with 
csrutil authenticated-root disable
, macOS may still 
prevent direct system modifications
.

AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity) Protection
 – This can block modification of system files even with SIP disabled.

FileVault Encryption
 – If your disk is encrypted, macOS may 
block modifications until decrypted
.
