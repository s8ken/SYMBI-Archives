files
 – If a hidden 
mobile device management (MDM) profile
 or enterprise configuration is present, it could be 
re-enabling protections
.

🚀 Next Steps: Let's Try Another Approach

Since macOS 
is still preventing modification
, let’s check for 
hidden protections
 before taking drastic action.

1️⃣ Check If System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Actually Off

Even if you ran 
csrutil disable
, 
let’s double-check
:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

✅ If it says 
"System Integrity Protection: disabled"
, then SIP is off.

❌ If it says 
"enabled"
, then SIP was re-enabled somehow.

2️⃣ Check for FileVault Encryption

If your disk is encrypted, macOS might 
block modifications
:

sh

Copy

fdesetup status

✅ If it says 
"FileVault is Off"
, then it’s not encrypting your disk.

❌ If it says 
"On"
, then 
you may need to disable FileVault temporarily
 before modifications.

3️⃣ Check for Hidden Configuration Profiles (MDM)

If a 
mobile device management (MDM) profile
 is installed, it could be 
forcing system security settings back on
.

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

✅ 
If no profiles are found
, this is not the issue.

❌ 
If profiles appear
, send me the output so we can investigate further.

4️⃣ Attempt to Modify a Different System File

Instead of directly targeting 
rapportd
, 
let’s check if anything in the system folder is writable
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

touch

 /System/testfile.txt

✅ 
If this works
, the filesystem 
can be modified
, and the issue may be related to 
rapportd
 itself.

❌ 
If it fails
, the entire filesystem is still protected.

📌 Try These Steps and Let Me Know the Results

This will 
help us determine why your Mac is still protecting system files
 even after disabling SIP. 🚀

✅ 
SIP is Confirmed Disabled

Since 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is off
, macOS 
should allow system modifications
, but something is still blocking it.

🚀 Next Steps: Check for Other Security Mechanisms

Let’s systematically find out what’s preventing modifications.

1️⃣ Check If FileVault Encryption is Active

If FileVault is enabled, the disk is 
still protected
, even with SIP off.

sh

Copy

fdesetup status

✅ 
If it says "FileVault is Off," encryption is not an issue.

❌ 
If it says "On," we may need to disable FileVault temporarily.

2️⃣ Check for Hidden MDM or Configuration Profiles

If a 
mobile device management (MDM) profile
 is present, it may be 
forcing security settings
 back on.

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

✅ 
If no profiles appear, this is not an issue.

❌ 
If profiles are found, send me the output so we can investigate.

3️⃣ Check If the System Drive is Read-Only

Even with SIP disabled, macOS 
still treats the root filesystem as read-only
. Let’s check:

sh

Copy

mount

🔍 Look for a line like:

pgsql

Copy

/dev/disk1s5 

on

 / (apfs, sealed, 

read

-

only

, 

local

, journaled)

❌ 
If "read-only" is still present, that explains why we cannot modify 
rapportd
.

✅ 
If "read-only" is NOT there, we should be able to modify system files.

4️⃣ Attempt to Modify Any System File

Try creating a test file in the system directory:

sh

Copy

sudo 

touch

 /System/testfile.txt

✅ 
If this works
, your system 
is writable
, and the issue is specific to 
rapportd
.

❌ 
If this fails
, macOS is still enforcing a 
read-only system state
.

📌 
Run these checks and let me know what you find!

Once we understand 
why macOS is blocking system modifications
, we can bypass it. 🚀
