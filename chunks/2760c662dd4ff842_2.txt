System Extensions

sh

Copy

kmutil showloaded | grep -i teamviewer

This will check for 
TeamViewer (or similar remote access tools)
 running at the kernel level.

If you see unexpected results, let me know.

Check Remote Management & TCC Permissions

sh

Copy

sudo defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement
sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

These will show 
whether Remote Management is enabled
 and 
which apps have full system access
.

Check for Hidden Launch Daemons

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/

If there are 
strange or recently modified files
, this could indicate persistence.

Would you like me to 
run through more forensic commands
 or focus on 
analyzing a specific part of this output
?

Absolutely! Let’s take it step by step.

Step 1: Check if System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Enabled

What SIP Does

System Integrity Protection (SIP) is a macOS security feature that 
prevents even root users from modifying system files
. If an attacker has disabled SIP, they could have deeper control over your system.

How to Check SIP Status

Open 
Terminal
 (Press 
Command (⌘) + Space
, type 
Terminal
, and press 
Enter
).

Type the following command and press 
Enter
:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

You will see one of these messages:

Enabled
 → SIP is active (good sign)

Disabled
 → SIP is off (this is a red flag)

📌 
Let me know what your result is, and we’ll move to the next step accordingly!

enabled

ChatGPT said:

Great! Since 
SIP is enabled
, it means macOS is still enforcing system-level protections. This makes it harder (but not impossible) for an attacker to modify critical system files.

Step 2: Check for Unauthorized System Extensions

Now, let’s check if any 
suspicious kernel extensions (kexts) or system services
 are running. This will help us identify any 
hidden persistence mechanisms
, such as remote access tools.

How to Check for Suspicious Kernel Extensions

In 
Terminal
, type the following command and press 
Enter
:

sh

Copy

kmutil showloaded

This will list all 
kernel extensions
 currently loaded on your Mac.

What to Look For

Do you see any entries related to TeamViewer, AnyDesk, LogMeIn, or other remote access tools?

Do you see any unknown or suspicious-looking entries?

If the list is too long and overwhelming, we can 
filter it
 by searching for common remote access tools. Try running:

sh

Copy

kmutil showloaded | grep -i teamviewer

If you used 
AnyDesk
 or 
other remote tools
, replace 
teamviewer
 with their name:

sh

Copy

kmutil showloaded | grep -i anydesk
kmutil showloaded | grep -i logmein

📌 
Let me know if you find anything suspicious, and we’ll move to the next step accordingly!

Step 2: Review of Your Kernel Extensions (
kmutil showloaded
)

I analyzed your 
kmutil showloaded
 output, and 
all the listed kernel extensions (kexts) appear to be Apple system components
. This means:

✅ 
No obvious third-party remote access tools
 (like TeamViewer, AnyDesk, LogMeIn, or hidden malware-related kexts) were detected at the kernel level.

What This Means

Since SIP is enabled, 
attackers would have difficulty loading unauthorized kernel extensions
.

No suspicious third-party kexts
 suggests that 
if an attacker still has access, it’s likely happening at the user-space level
 (e.g., through hidden apps, LaunchDaemons, or manipulated TCC permissions).

Step 3: Check for Remote Management & TCC Permissions

Next, let’s check 
if any unauthorized apps have full system access
.

Command 1: Check if Remote Management is Enabled

This will show whether 
Remote Management (used by attackers for stealth access)
 is active:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement
