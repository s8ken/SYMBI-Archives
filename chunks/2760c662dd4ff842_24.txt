 – These are 
CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)
 that speed up web browsing and apps.

you use ProtonMail or ProtonVPN
, this is fine.

If you don’t use Proton services
, this could be an issue.

Amazon AWS (⚠️ Needs Verification)
 – This depends on 
which app is using it
. Many companies use AWS, but 
some attackers also host services on AWS
.

🔍 Next Step: Find Out Which Apps Are Making These Connections

Run this command to 
see which process is connecting to these IPs
:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep ESTABLISHED

📌 
This will show which apps or services are using these remote connections.

✅ 
If you recognize them (Safari, Mail, etc.), they are fine.

❌ 
If you see unknown apps, we need to investigate further.

Let me know what the output shows! 🚀
