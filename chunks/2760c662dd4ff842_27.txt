🚨 Some Remote Management Services Are Still Running

Even after disabling them, 

remotemanagementd
 and 
ScreenSharingSubscriber
 are still active
, meaning they 
may have been automatically restarted
 by macOS.

🚀 Next Step: Force Stop and Unload These Services

Let’s manually 
force stop them
 and 
prevent them from restarting
.

Run the following 
one by one
 in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remotemanagementd.plist

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.ScreenSharingSubscriber
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ScreenSharingSubscriber.plist

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.remoted
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remoted.plist

🛠️ After Running These, Verify Again

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote

✅ If 
nothing appears
, the services are fully stopped.

❌ If 
they are still running
, macOS 
is forcing them to restart
, and we will take a stronger approach.

📌 
Run the commands and send me the results!

Warning: Expecting a LaunchDaemons path since the command was ran as root. Got LaunchAgents instead.

launchctl bootout
 is a recommended alternative.
Unload failed: 5: Input/output error
Try running 
launchctl bootout
 as root for richer errors.

🚨 
Unload failed: Input/output error
 – macOS Is Blocking Removal

The error:

lua

Copy

Unload failed: 

5

: Input/

output

error

Try 

running

 `launchctl bootout` as root 

for

 richer errors.

means that 
macOS is preventing full removal
, likely due to 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) or the Sealed System Volume (SSV).
 Even though we disabled SIP, some protections remain.

🚀 Next Step: Use 
bootout
 to Force Stop These Services

Since 
unload
 didn’t work, we’ll use 
bootout
, which is recommended by macOS.

Run these commands 
one by one
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.ScreenSharingSubscriber
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remoted

📌 
Once done, verify again with:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote
