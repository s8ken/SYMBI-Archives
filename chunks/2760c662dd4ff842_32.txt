sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E

2️⃣ Simulate an Unauthorized Network Connection (LuLu Test)

Open 
Terminal
 and try to 
ping
 an external server:

sh

Copy

ping google.com

If 
LuLu prompts you
, that means it’s actively monitoring.

3️⃣ Simulate a Microphone/Camera Activation (Oversight Test)

Open 
FaceTime or Zoom
 (without joining a call).

Oversight should notify you that the 
camera and mic are being accessed
.

✅ If the notification appears, Oversight is working!
