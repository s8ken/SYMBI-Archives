✅ 
Great! Most of your security tools are running properly!
 🔒🚀

Here’s what’s working:

✔️ 
LuLu (Firewall) → Running ✅

✔️ 
BlockBlock (Persistence Monitoring) → Running ✅

✔️ 
RansomWhere? (Anti-Ransomware) → Running ✅

However, 
Oversight and KnockKnock are missing from the list.

🚀 Next Step: Ensure Oversight & KnockKnock Are Running

Run these commands 
to manually start them
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

Then, 
re-run the check
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'Oversight|KnockKnock'

📌 
Let me know if they now appear in the list!
 If not, we’ll troubleshoot further. 🚀

🚨 
Oversight and KnockKnock are still not running!

We need to make sure they are properly installed and set to 
start automatically
.

🚀 Step 1: Manually Start Them

Try launching them again 
one by one
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

✅ If they 
open successfully
, they should now appear in the process list.

🚀 Step 2: Verify If They're Running

Run this again:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'Oversight|KnockKnock'

✅ 
If they now appear
 → Success! We'll then set them to start at login.

❌ 
If they still don’t appear
, let me know—we may need to 
reinstall them
.

🚀 Step 3: Ensure They Start at Login

Once they are running, let’s make sure 
they launch automatically
:

Open 
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
Login Items
.

Click 
"+"
 and add:

Oversight.app

KnockKnock.app

Restart your Mac to confirm they auto-start.

📌 
Try these steps and let me know the results!

✅ 
KnockKnock is now running!
 🎉

However, 
it is running from a temporary location (
/private/var/.../AppTranslocation/...
)
, which means macOS 
quarantined it and is running it in a sandbox
.

🚀 Fix KnockKnock’s Location (Move It to Applications)

Close KnockKnock
 (Quit the app).

Move it to the 
Applications folder
 manually:

sh

Copy

sudo 

mv

 /private/var/folders/b7/jn17zrs14m51hnxdrk74_xqw0000gn/T/AppTranslocation/*/KnockKnock.app /Applications/

(If this gives an error, move it manually by dragging it in Finder).

Restart KnockKnock:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

Verify it’s running correctly:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep KnockKnock

🚨 Oversight is Still Not Running

Since Oversight 
still isn’t appearing
, let’s try launching it again:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

Then, check if it’s running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

📌 
Try these steps and let me know the results!
