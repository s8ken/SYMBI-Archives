🚨 
Oversight is still not running!

Since you tried launching it (
open /Applications/Oversight.app
), but it 
does not appear in the process list
, we need to 
reinstall it
.

🚀 Step 1: Reinstall Oversight

1️⃣ 
Delete the current installation

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app

2️⃣ 
Download a fresh copy

Go to:

👉 
Objective-See Oversight

3️⃣ 
Install Oversight

Open the 
.dmg
 file.

Drag 
Oversight.app
 to the 
Applications folder
.

4️⃣ 
Try launching again

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

5️⃣ 
Check if it’s running

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

📌 
Try these steps and let me know if Oversight appears! 🚀

🚨 
Oversight is still not running after relaunching.

Since you've tried launching it and checking the process list, but 
Oversight does not appear
, we need to 
troubleshoot deeper
.

🚀 Step 1: Check for Oversight Errors

Try running Oversight 
directly from Terminal
 to see if it gives any errors:

sh

Copy

/Applications/Oversight.app/Contents/MacOS/Oversight

✅ 
If it runs successfully
, it should now appear in 
ps aux
.

❌ 
If it shows an error
, copy and paste the error message here.

🚀 Step 2: Check macOS Security Settings

If Oversight 
still doesn’t start
, macOS may be blocking it.

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll to 
Security
 and check for a message like:

"Oversight was blocked from running because it is not from an identified developer."

If you see this, 
click “Allow”
 and try launching Oversight again.

🚀 Step 3: Manually Grant Permissions

Since Oversight 
monitors the microphone and camera
, it needs special permissions.

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Microphone & Camera
.

Make sure 
Oversight
 is listed and 
enabled
.

If it’s 
not listed
, reinstall it and try again.

I think I need to configure it

ChatGPT said:

✅ 
Yes! You likely need to configure Oversight before it runs properly.
 Let’s set it up step by step.

🚀 Step 1: Manually Launch the Configuration

Since Oversight runs in the background, it may need to be manually set up.

1️⃣ Open Oversight’s settings manually:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

2️⃣ If a window pops up asking for permissions, 
follow the setup steps
.

🚀 Step 2: Grant Necessary Permissions

Since Oversight 
monitors the microphone and camera
, macOS may be blocking it.

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll to 
Microphone
 and 
Camera
.

Ensure 
Oversight
 is listed and 
enabled
.

If Oversight is 
not listed
, we need to reinstall and run it manually.

🚀 Step 3: Check If It's Running

Once you've configured it, check if it’s
