 running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

✅ 
If it appears, you’re good to go!

❌ 
If not, let me know what’s happening—any errors or missing options?

Reinstalling Oversight is the best next step!
 Let's do it carefully to make sure it installs properly and gets the necessary permissions.

🚀 Step 1: Fully Remove Oversight

First, delete any old files to avoid conflicts:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app

Then, check for any leftover files:

sh

Copy

sudo find /Library /Users -name 

"*Oversight*"

 -

exec

rm

 -rf {} +

This removes any old config files that might be interfering.

🚀 Step 2: Download a Fresh Copy

Go to
 👉 
Objective-See Oversight

Download the 
.dmg
 file.

Open the 
.dmg
 file and drag 
Oversight.app
 to Applications.

🚀 Step 3: Manually Open & Configure Oversight

Now, launch Oversight manually so macOS recognizes it:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

If a 
security prompt appears
, click 
Allow
.

If macOS blocks it, 
go to
:

System Settings → Privacy & Security
 → Scroll down to "Allow apps downloaded from" → Click 
"Allow"
 for Oversight.

🚀 Step 4: Grant Permissions

Once Oversight opens, manually 
grant it permission
:

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
.

Click 
Microphone
 → Ensure Oversight is 
enabled
.

Click 
Camera
 → Ensure Oversight is 
enabled
.

Click 
Full Disk Access
 → 
Add Oversight
 if it's not listed.

🚀 Step 5: Verify That It's Running

Once permissions are granted, check if it’s running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

✅ 
If Oversight appears in the list, it's working!
 🎉

❌ 
If not, let me know where you get stuck!

terminal is asking to access data from other apps

ChatGPT said:

🚨 
macOS is asking Terminal for access to other app data because you ran 
sudo find /Library /Users -name "*Oversight*"

. This is normal since we were searching for leftover files.

🚀 What to Do Now?

1️⃣ If prompted, 
click "Deny"
 → We don’t need Terminal to access other app data.

2️⃣ Instead, we will 
manually check for leftover files
:

Run:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/Objective-See

If you see a folder named 
Oversight
, delete it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Objective-See/Oversight

🚀 Continue with Reinstall

Now, follow these steps to reinstall:

Go to
: 
Objective-See Oversight

Download and 
install
 Oversight.

Manually launch it
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

Grant permissions
 (Privacy & Security → Microphone & Camera).

Check if it's running
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

📌 
Try this and let me know if Oversight finally runs!
