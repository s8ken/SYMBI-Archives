🚨 
You're seeing "Operation not permitted" errors because macOS is blocking access to certain system and user files due to privacy settings.
 This is expected behavior when running 
find
 without full disk access.

🚀 Step 1: Enable Full Disk Access for Terminal

To allow Terminal to remove all Oversight-related files, we need to grant it 
Full Disk Access
.

1️⃣ Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Full Disk Access
.

2️⃣ Find and 
enable Full Disk Access for Terminal
.

If Terminal isn’t listed, 
click the 
+
 button, add it from 
/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app
, and enable it
.

3️⃣ Close 
System Settings
 and restart Terminal.

Now, 
rerun the cleanup command
:

sh

Copy

sudo find /Library /Users -name 

"*Oversight*"

 -

exec

rm

 -rf {} +

✅ This should now delete any remaining Oversight files.

🚀 Step 2: Reinstall Oversight

Download a fresh copy
 from 

Objective-See Oversight

.

Open the 
.dmg
 file and 
drag 
Oversight.app
 to Applications
.

Run:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

If it 
doesn’t launch
, go to 
System Settings → Privacy & Security
 and allow it under 
"Allow apps downloaded from"
.

🚀 Step 3: Verify Oversight is Running

After launching, check if it's running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

✅ 
If it appears, it’s now running successfully!

📌 
Try these steps and let me know the result!

✅ 
Perfect! The "Operation not permitted" messages are now minimal, meaning you successfully removed most of Oversight's files.

🚀 Step 1: Final Oversight Reinstallation

Now, let’s do a 
clean install
:

1️⃣ 
Download a fresh copy
:

👉 
Objective-See Oversight

2️⃣ 
Install it properly
:

Open the 
.dmg
 file.

Drag 
Oversight.app
 into the Applications folder
.

If it asks to replace an old version, confirm 
Replace
.

3️⃣ 
Launch Oversight manually
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

4️⃣ 
Check if it's running
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

🚀 Step 2: Grant Permissions

If Oversight 
still doesn’t run
, macOS may be blocking it. Try this:

Go to
: 
System Settings → Privacy & Security
.

Scroll down to
: 
"Allow apps downloaded from"
.

If Oversight is listed, click 
Allow Anyway
.

Go to Microphone & Camera settings
:

Ensure 
Oversight is listed and enabled
.

🚀 Step 3: Check if It Starts at Login

Open 
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
Login Items
.

Click 
"+"
 and add:

Oversight.app

📌 
Try these steps and let me know if Oversight finally launches!
