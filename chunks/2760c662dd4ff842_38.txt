🎉 
Fantastic! Oversight is now running properly!
 🚀🔒

With 
LuLu, BlockBlock, KnockKnock, RansomWhere?, and Oversight
 all set up, your Mac now has 
strong proactive and reactive security defenses
.

🚀 Final Verification Checklist

Let's do a final quick check to confirm everything is running:

1️⃣ 
Check all security tools

Run this command:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'LuLu|BlockBlock|KnockKnock|RansomWhere|Oversight'

✅ 
If they all appear, you're fully secured!

2️⃣ 
Test Oversight Notifications

Open 
FaceTime
 or 
Zoom
 (without joining a call).

Oversight should 
alert you that the camera/mic is being accessed
.

✅ If the alert appears, 
Oversight is working perfectly
!

3️⃣ 
Check Network Monitoring (LuLu Test)

Run:

sh

Copy

ping google.com

If 
LuLu prompts you
, that means it's monitoring all network connections.

✅ 
If you see the prompt, LuLu is actively blocking unknown traffic!

🔐 Next Steps: Ongoing Security

✅ 
Auto-Update Your Security Tools
 (they don’t auto-update by default).

✅ 
Review KnockKnock & BlockBlock Alerts Monthly
 for hidden threats.

✅ 
Check Logs Occasionally
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS "LuLu" OR process CONTAINS "Oversight"'

 --info --last 24h

(This shows what was blocked or monitored in the past 24 hours).

🔴 
If you ever notice anything suspicious, just let me know—we’ll analyze and fix it together!
 🚀💪

📌 
Let me know if you want to tweak anything or add another layer of protection!
