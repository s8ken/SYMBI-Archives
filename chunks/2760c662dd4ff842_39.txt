 check if it's running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

✅ 
If it now appears in the list, it’s working!
 🎉

🚀 Step 2: Check If It’s Crashing

If Oversight 
still doesn’t show up
, let’s check for errors:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS "Oversight"'

 --info --last 10m

✅ If you see error messages, copy and paste them here so we can troubleshoot further.

🚀 Step 3: Ensure Oversight Starts at Login

Open 
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
Login Items
.

Click 
"+"
 and add 
Oversight.app
.

Restart your Mac and check if Oversight starts automatically.

📌 
Try these steps and let me know if Oversight is running!

🚨 
Oversight is still not running.
 Let's do a final deep troubleshooting to get it working.

🚀 Step 1: Try Running Oversight from Terminal Directly

Since launching it normally isn’t working, let’s run it 
directly from the command line
 to check for errors:

sh

Copy

/Applications/Oversight.app/Contents/MacOS/Oversight

✅ If it runs successfully, it should now appear in 
ps aux
.

❌ 
If it gives an error, copy and paste the error message here.
 This will help us troubleshoot further.

🚀 Step 2: Check macOS Security Settings

Mac might be blocking Oversight. To fix this:

1️⃣ Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
.

2️⃣ Scroll down to 
Security
 → Look for a message saying:

"Oversight was blocked from running because it is not from an identified developer."

If you see this, click 
"Allow Anyway"
.

3️⃣ Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Microphone & Camera
.

Make sure Oversight is listed and enabled.

🚀 Step 3: Check for Crash Logs

If Oversight still doesn’t start, let's check if it’s crashing:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS "Oversight"'

 --info --last 10m

✅ 
If it shows errors, paste them here so I can analyze.

🚀 Step 4: Reinstall Oversight One More Time (If Still Failing)

If 
Steps 1-3 don’t work
, let’s 
fully remove and reinstall it
:

1️⃣ 
Delete the current version
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app

2️⃣ 
Download a fresh copy
:

👉 
Objective-See Oversight

3️⃣ 
Install & Launch
:

Open the 
.dmg
 file and 
drag Oversight into Applications
.

Run:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

4️⃣ 
Check again
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

📌 
Try these steps and let me know what happens! If there's an error, send me the output so I can troubleshoot further.

You said:

hmmm its strange you say its not running because when I start Photo Booth or start a QuickTime recording it is warning me about the camera and mic

ChatGPT said:

✅ 
Great news! If Oversight is warning you when the camera or microphone is activated, then it is actually running!
 🎉

The reason 
it's not appearing in 
ps aux

 could be because 
it runs as a background agent rather than a visible process.
 Some macOS security tools don’t always show up in a simple 
ps aux
 command.

🚀 Final Confirmation That Oversight is Running

Let's do a deeper check to confirm Oversight is active:

1️⃣ Check for Its Running Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

pgrep -lf Oversight

✅ If it 
returns a process ID (PID)
, Oversight is running!

2️⃣ Check Its Log Activity

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS "Oversight"'

 --info --last 10m

✅ If it shows logs of Oversight activity, then it's definitely running!

🎯 Conclusion: You’re Secure!

Since 
Oversight is actively notifying you when your camera or mic is used
, it is 
functioning as expected.
 The issue is likely just that 
it doesn’t always show up in 
ps aux

 due to how it runs in macOS.

🚀 
Your Mac is now fully secured with:

✅ 
Firewall protection (LuLu)

✅ 
Persistence monitoring (BlockBlock & KnockKnock)

✅ 
Ransomware defense (RansomWhere?)

✅ 
Mic & camera monitoring (Oversight)
