🚨 
Strange Behavior: Oversight Is Alerting You, But Not Showing in System Processes or Logs

Since 
you're receiving notifications from Oversight
, but 
it’s not appearing in 
pgrep
, 
ps aux
, or logs
, there are a few possibilities:

1️⃣ 
Oversight is running as a hidden background process
 (potentially using 
launchd
 instead of a standard process).

2️⃣ 
A different security feature (like macOS's built-in protections) is sending the alerts, not Oversight.

3️⃣ 
A previous version of Oversight was installed incorrectly or partially, causing inconsistencies.

🚀 Step 1: Check If macOS Itself Is Sending the Alerts

macOS 
has built-in security features
 that may be triggering camera/mic notifications. Let’s check if 
it's actually Oversight
:

🔹 Open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 com.objective-see.oversight

✅ If 
this returns settings/data
, then 
Oversight is installed and running correctly
.

❌ If it 
returns an error or nothing
, Oversight is not fully installed.

🚀 Step 2: Check If It's Running Under 
launchd

Since Oversight may not be running as a standard process, let's check if 
launchd
 is keeping it alive:

Run:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i oversight

✅ If Oversight is listed, then 
macOS is managing it in the background
.

❌ If 
no output appears
, Oversight 
isn't running properly
 and may need a reinstall.

🚀 Step 3: Check If Oversight Is Installed in the Right Place

Run:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications | grep Oversight

✅ If 
Oversight is listed
, it is correctly installed in Applications.

❌ If 
it’s missing
, then something removed or blocked it.

🚀 Step 4: If Oversight Still Isn't Found, Reinstall It

If any of the above checks 
fail to detect Oversight
, do a clean reinstall:

1️⃣ 
Uninstall completely
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app
sudo find /Library /Users -name 

"*Oversight*"

 -

exec

rm

 -rf {} +

2️⃣ 
Reinstall from 
Objective-See's Website

.

3️⃣ 
Manually launch it
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

4️⃣ 
Check again
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

📌 
Try these steps and let me know what you find!
 If we still can't locate Oversight, we’ll do a deeper system check. 🚀

You said:

there is an action tab

ChatGPT said:

✅ 
If there’s an "Action" tab in the alert you’re seeing, then the notifications are almost certainly coming from Oversight!
 🎉

That means 
Oversight is working
 but is likely running in a way that doesn’t show up in normal system process checks (
ps aux
, 
pgrep
, or 
log show
).

🚀 Next Steps (Optional - If You Want to Investigate Further)

If you want to 
verify Oversight’s background activity
, we can check if it's running as a 
launchd
 agent:

1️⃣ 
Check if macOS is launching it in the background

Run:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i oversight

✅ 
If Oversight appears
, it is correctly managed by 
launchd
 (even if it doesn’t show up in 
ps aux
).

2️⃣ 
Manually Start and Stop Oversight (For Testing)

If you want to restart Oversight manually, try:

sh

Copy

launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.objective-see.oversight.plist
launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/
