asking to excecute script or binary when an even is detected

ChatGPT said:

✅ 
Yes! Oversight has an "Action" tab that allows you to execute a script or binary whenever an event is detected.
 This is a powerful feature if you want 
custom alerts, logs, or automated actions
 when your microphone or camera is activated.

🚀 How to Use Oversight’s "Action" Feature

You can configure Oversight to 
automatically take an action
 when a camera/mic event is detected. Here’s how:

1️⃣ Create a Script for Automated Actions

We can create a script that 
logs details, alerts you, or even takes defensive action
 (e.g., shutting down an app).

Example: Simple Logging Script

This script 
logs the event
 and displays a macOS notification.

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

nano ~/oversight-alert.sh

Paste the following script:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

TIMESTAMP=$(

date

"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

)
LOGFILE=~/oversight_log.txt

echo

"[
$TIMESTAMP

] Oversight detected Camera/Mic access!" >> 

$LOGFILE

osascript -e 

'display notification "Oversight detected access!" with title "Security Alert"'

Save and exit:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

Make the script executable
:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x ~/oversight-alert.sh

2️⃣ Configure Oversight to Use This Script

Now, we’ll configure Oversight to execute this script 
whenever the camera or mic is accessed
.

Open Oversight's Settings
.

Click the 
"Action"
 tab.

Click 
"Select Script"
 and 
choose
 the script you just created:

sh

Copy

~/oversight-alert.sh

Click 
"Save"
.

3️⃣ Test the Setup

To test, open 
Photo Booth or QuickTime Recording
.

✅ 
If everything is working
, you should:

See a notification.

Find a new log entry in 
~/oversight_log.txt
.

🚀 Advanced Actions

You can customize the script to:

Send an email or Telegram alert
.

Automatically kill a suspicious process
.

Block network access for certain apps
.

Let me know if you want a 
custom security action
, and I can help write a script for it! 🚀🔒

You said:

its wants me to select a path

ChatGPT said:

✅ 
Since Oversight wants a file path for the script, let’s ensure the script is correctly saved and accessible.

🚀 Step 1: Confirm the Script Path

The script must be saved in a 
permanent location
 that Oversight can access.

1️⃣ 
Move the script to a safe location:

sh

Copy

mv

 ~/oversight-alert.sh /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

2️⃣ 
Check the path:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

✅ If it appears, the script is in the correct place.

🚀 Step 2: Select the Script in Oversight

Open Oversight Settings
 → 
Go to the "Action" tab
.

Click 
"Select Script"
.

Navigate to

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh
 and select it.

Click 
"Save"
.

🚀 Step 3: Test the Setup

Now, test if Oversight correctly executes the script:

Open 
Photo Booth
 or 
QuickTime Recording
.

✅ If everything is working, you should:

See a 
notification
.

Find a 
log entry in 
/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

.

🚀 Need Custom Actions?

Do you want the script to 
block apps, kill a process, or send alerts
 when the camera/mic is accessed? Let me know, and I can customize it for you! 🚀🔒

You said:

ok so it warned me when I did the recording but I can't find the log file 

ChatGPT said:

✅ 
Great! Oversight successfully ran the script when you started recording!
 🎉

Now, let's troubleshoot why the log file isn’t appearing.

🚀 Step 1: Manually Run the Script to Check for Errors
