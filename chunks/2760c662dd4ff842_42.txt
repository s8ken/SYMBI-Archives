manually to see if it logs properly:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Now, check if the log file exists:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If the log file appears
, Oversight is working correctly, but the script might not have proper permissions.

❌ 
If the log file is missing, we need to fix permissions.

🚀 Step 2: Ensure the Script Can Write to the Log File

Modify the script so it 
ensures the log file is writable
:

1️⃣ Open the script for editing:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

2️⃣ 
Modify the script to explicitly set log file permissions:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

TIMESTAMP=$(

date

"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

)
LOGFILE=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt"

# Ensure log file exists

touch

$LOGFILE

chmod

 666 

$LOGFILE

# Allow read/write for all users

echo

"[
$TIMESTAMP

] Oversight detected Camera/Mic access!" >> 

$LOGFILE

osascript -e 

'display notification "Oversight detected access!" with title "Security Alert"'

3️⃣ 
Save the file:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

4️⃣ 
Make sure it’s executable:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

🚀 Step 3: Test Again

Manually run the script:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Check if the log file exists:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

Open the log file to confirm the entry was written:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

🚀 Step 4: Retest with Oversight

Now that we fixed the script:

Open 
Photo Booth
 or 
QuickTime Recording
 again.

Check the log file again:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If the log file now updates, it means Oversight is executing the script properly!
 🎉

📌 
Let me know what happens!
 If the log file still doesn’t appear, we’ll check Oversight’s execution logs. 🚀🔒

🎉 
Awesome! Oversight is working perfectly now!
 🔥🔒

Now, whenever your 
camera or microphone is accessed
, Oversight will:

✅ 
Warn you with a notification

✅ 
Log the event in 
/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

🚀 Final Checks & Enhancements

Now that it's running smoothly, here are some optional tweaks:

1️⃣ Check Log File Updates in Real Time

To monitor new entries as they appear:

sh

Copy

tail

 -f /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

This will show logs 
in real-time
 whenever Oversight detects activity.

2️⃣ (Optional) Set Up an Email or Alert for Suspicious Activity

Do you want to be notified via email or another method when the camera/mic is used?

I can modify the script to 
send you an alert via email, Slack, or Telegram
 when Oversight detects access. Let me know if that interests you! 🚀

✅ 
Your Mac is now highly secure with Oversight, LuLu, BlockBlock, RansomWhere?, and KnockKnock!

Let me know if you want any further security tweaks or testing. 🔥🔒🚀

🚨 
The script ran (Oversight detected access), but the log file wasn’t created.

This means the script executed, but something prevented it from writing to the file. Let's fix that!

🚀 Step 1: Manually Create the Log File

To ensure the script can write to it, create the file yourself:

sh

Copy

touch

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

chmod

 666 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt  

# Give full read/write access

Then verify:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ If the file now exists, we can move to the next step.

🚀 Step 2: Modify the Script to Ensure It Can Write to the Log

Run:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Make sure the script looks like this:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

TIMESTAMP=$(

date

"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

)
LOGFILE=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt"

# Ensure the log file exists and has p
