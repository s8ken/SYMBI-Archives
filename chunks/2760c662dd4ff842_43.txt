] Oversight detected Camera/Mic access!" >> 

$LOGFILE

osascript -e 

'display notification "Oversight detected access!" with title "Security Alert"'

Then 
save the file
:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

Make sure it’s 
executable
:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

🚀 Step 3: Manually Run the Script & Check the Log

Now, manually execute it:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Check if the log file now exists:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If the log file now updates, the script is working fine!
 🎉

🚀 Step 4: Retest with Oversight

Now that we've ensured the script works:

Open 
Photo Booth or QuickTime Recording
.

After the Oversight alert, check the log file again:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If it now logs properly, everything is fixed!

📌 Let me know if the log file still doesn't update, and we’ll troubleshoot further. 🚀🔒

Oops! The issue is that the command included a 
comment (# Give full read/write)
, and 
chmod
 tried to interpret it as a filename. Let's correct that.

🚀 Step 1: Create & Set Permissions for the Log File

Run these commands 
one at a time
:

sh

Copy

touch

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

chmod

 666 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

Then verify:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If the file appears, it’s now ready for logging!
 🎉

🚀 Step 2: Manually Run the Script & Check the Log

Now, execute the script manually:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Then check the log file to see if it recorded the event:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If you see a log entry, the script is working properly!

🚀 Step 3: Retest with Oversight

Open 
Photo Booth
 or 
QuickTime Recording
.

Once 
Oversight detects access
, check the log file again:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If it now logs properly, everything is fixed!

📌 
Let me know if the log file still doesn’t update after an Oversight alert!

✅ 
Perfect! The log file now exists and has the correct permissions!
 🎉

Now, let's test if 
the script can write to it
.

🚀 Step 1: Manually Run the Script to Write to the Log

Run:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Now, check if the log file has an entry:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If you see a timestamped entry like this, the script is working:

csharp

Copy

[

2025-03-07 01:32:45

] Oversight detected Camera/Mic access!

❌ 
If the log is still empty, we need to fix script execution.

🚀 Step 2: Ensure the Script is Executable

To make sure Oversight can execute it, run:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Then, test again:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

🚀 Step 3: Retest with Oversight

Open 
Photo Booth
 or 
QuickTime Recording
.

Once 
Oversight detects access
, check the log file again:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

✅ 
If it now logs properly, everything is fully functional!
 🎉

If the log file still doesn’t update, let me know and we’ll
