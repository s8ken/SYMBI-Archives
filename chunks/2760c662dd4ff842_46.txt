 to the script:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"

CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults 

read

 com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists

if

 [ -f 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

    LAST_SETTINGS=$(

cat

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

")

if

 [

$LAST_SETTINGS

then

echo

"ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!"

 | mail -s 

"Accessibility Settings Change Alert"

 your-email@example.com

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

else

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

3️⃣ 
Save and make it executable
:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

4️⃣ 
Run the script manually
 or use 
cron jobs
 to run it at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 minutes).

🚀 Step 3: Set Up a Cron Job for Regular Checks

If you want the script to run 
automatically
 at intervals, you can use 
cron
 to schedule it.

1️⃣ Open the crontab for editing:

sh

Copy

crontab -e

2️⃣ Add a line to run the script every 10 minutes (you can adjust the frequency as needed):

sh

Copy

*/10 * * * * /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

3️⃣ 
Save and exit
. The script will now run every 10 minutes and alert you if there’s a change in your accessibility settings.

🚀 Step 4: Test the Setup

To test, try changing an accessibility option (like 
VoiceOver
, 
Zoom
, etc.) and check if you receive an email or notification.

🚀 Step 5: Enhance with Other Monitoring Tools

If you want even more visibility into these settings, we could combine this with 
Oversight
, 
LuLu
, or even use tools like 
BlockBlock
 to monitor app installations and file changes as well.
