No worries! If the file was saved but didn't work as expected, we can fix it easily.

Here’s what to do next:

🚀 Step 1: Open the Script for Editing

Let’s open the script again to check its contents:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

🚀 Step 2: Verify Script Content

Make sure the script is written correctly. It should look like this:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"

CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults 

read

 com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists

if

 [ -f 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

    LAST_SETTINGS=$(

cat

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

")

if

 [ 

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" != 

"
$LAST_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

echo

"ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!"

 | mail -s 

"Accessibility Settings Change Alert"

 your-email@example.com

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

else

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

🚀 Step 5: Test the Script

Finally, run the script to see if it logs properly:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Let me know how it goes or if you encounter any issues! If the script still isn't running, we can troubleshoot further.

You said:

#!/bin/bash
ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS="/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"
CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults read com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists
if [ -f "$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS" ]; then
    LAST_SETTINGS=$(cat "$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS")
    if [ "$CURRENT_SETTINGS" != "$LAST_SETTINGS" ]; then
        echo "ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!" | mail -s "Accessibi$
        echo "$CURRENT_SETTINGS" > "$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS"
    fi
else
    echo "$CURRENT_SETTINGS" > "$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS"

It looks like the script is almost correct but it seems to have been cut off at the 
mail command
 (
echo "ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!" | mail -s "Accessibi$
). Let's fix this issue by completing the 
mail command
 properly and ensuring everything is in order.

🚀 Corrected Script

Here’s the corrected version of your script:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"

CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults 

read

 com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists

if

 [ -f 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

    LAST_SETTINGS=$(

cat

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

")

if

 [ 

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" != 

"
$LAST_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

echo

"ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!"

 | mail -s 

"Accessibility Settings Change Alert"

 your-email@example.com

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

else

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS
