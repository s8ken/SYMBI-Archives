🚀 Corrected Script

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"

CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults 

read

 com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists

echo

Explanation:

The 
mail command
 is now completed with the full syntax:

sh

Copy

echo

"ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!"

 | mail -s 

"Accessibility Settings Change Alert"

 your-email@example.com

Replace 
your-email@example.com
 with the actual email address where you want to receive alerts.

🚀 Step 1: Save the Updated Script

Open the script again to edit:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Replace the existing content with the 
corrected script
 above.

Save and exit
 the editor:

Press 
CTRL + X
 to exit.

Press 
Y
 to confirm saving.

Press 
Enter
 to save with the same name.

🚀 Step 2: Make the Script Executable

If it's not already executable, run this command:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

🚀 Step 3: Test the Script

To test it manually:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Check your email inbox for an alert. If everything works, the script should notify you if accessibility settings change.

If the script 
looks like it worked
 but you're still waiting for the email, there are a few things we need to check and troubleshoot. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you investigate:

🚀 Step 1: Check if the 
mail
 Command Is Working

First, let's ensure that the 
mail
 command is working correctly on your system.

Test sending a simple email
 from the terminal:

sh

Copy

echo

"This is a test email"

 | mail -s 

"Test Email"

 your-email@example.com

Check your inbox
 for the test email. If you receive it, then the mail system is working fine.

✅ 
If you received the email
, we know the problem is with the script logic or the email sending portion.

❌ 
If you didn’t receive the email
, there may be an issue with how your Mac is configured to send emails. If that's the case, we'll need to configure your email settings.

🚀 Step 2: Check the Script Output

Let’s make sure that the 
script is running correctly
 and writing the necessary changes.

Run the script manually
 again:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Check for any errors
 or confirmation in the terminal after running it. If there are any errors, they might be preventing the email from being sent.

🚀 Step 3: Check if Accessibility Settings Actually Changed

The script will only send an email if the accessibility settings have changed. If no changes have occurred, it won’t send an email.

Manually change an accessibility setting
 (e.g., enable or disable 
VoiceOver
 or 
Zoom
).

Run the script
 again:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Check if the email is sent
 after you change an accessibility setting.

🚀 Step 4: Check if 
mail
 Command Requires Configuration

If you're not getting emails, macOS might not be configured to send them through the terminal.

Check if you have a mail client like 
Postfix
 set up
:

You can test this by checking the system's mail configuration:

sh

Copy

postconf -n

If it seems misconfigured or you don’t have a mail server set up, consider using a different 
email-sending tool
, like 

msmtp

 or using a third-party 
SMTP server
 like Gmail.
