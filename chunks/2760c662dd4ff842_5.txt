Do you really want to turn remote login off? If you do, you will lose this connection and can only turn it back on locally at the server (yes/no)? yes
setremotelogin: remote login is already Off.
sudo: launchct: command not found

Great work! 
Remote Login is already OFF
, so that’s a good sign.

Fix for 
launchctl
 Command Error

It looks like there was a typo when running 
launchctl
. The correct command is:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing

Let’s try again with the correct command. Copy and paste this 
one by one
 into 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.RemoteDesktop
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /var/db/RemoteManagement

✅ 
Once done, Remote Management & Screen Sharing will be permanently blocked.

📌 
Run these, and let me know if you get any errors!

Excellent! Remote Management & Screen Sharing are now completely disabled.

These services 
cannot be turned on remotely anymore
, meaning no one can enable them without 
physical access to your Mac
.

Next Step: Block Network Drive Access

Now, let’s 
prevent unauthorized connections to network drives
 (SMB, AFP, NFS).

Disable File Sharing & Network Services

Copy and paste each command 
one by one
 into Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.smbd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AFPServer
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.nfsd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.filesharingd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.NetworkBrowserAgent
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleFileServer.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.smb.server.plist

✅ 
What This Does:

Prevents your Mac from connecting to shared folders or network drives

Stops automatic network browsing (other devices won’t "see" your Mac)

📌 
Once you've run these, let me know if you get any errors!
