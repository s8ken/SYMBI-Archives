ed access to your system, they are 
restricted from causing damage
 through 
Terminal
, we need to implement several security measures that 
limit their access
 and 
control system behavior
.

Here are a few key strategies you can use to safeguard your system:

🚀 Step 1: Enable FileVault (Full Disk Encryption)

This ensures that 
your entire disk is encrypted
 and only accessible by you with the correct password.

Turn on FileVault
 (if not already enabled):

Go to 
System Preferences
 → 
Security & Privacy
 → 
FileVault
.

Click on 
Turn On FileVault
.

This will require your password for decryption, preventing anyone without your password from accessing your files (including via Terminal).

🚀 Step 2: Use Strong Passwords

Make sure that all your user accounts are protected with 
strong passwords
 to prevent unauthorized access.

Change your password
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 → 
Users & Groups
.

Change the password for your user account and any other accounts that may be vulnerable.

Consider using a 
password manager
 to generate and store strong, unique passwords for each account.

🚀 Step 3: Limit sudo (Superuser) Access

Restricting 

sudo

 privileges prevents unauthorized users from executing administrative commands.

Modify 
sudoers
 file
:

Open Terminal and type:

sh

Copy

sudo visudo

Edit sudoers file
 to limit who can run 
sudo
 commands:

You can restrict 
sudo
 access to only your user account.

For example, ensure your user account is the only one listed under the 
sudo
 group.

Disable sudo for other accounts
:

If you suspect that there are rogue accounts with 
sudo
 access, remove their entries or disable them.

🚀 Step 4: Use a Guest User Account (or disable all other accounts)

If you're concerned about unauthorized access, 
disable unused accounts
 or enable a 
Guest account
 with limited access.

Disable unused accounts
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 → 
Users & Groups
.

Disable any unused accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

Enable Guest User
 (with restricted access):

Under 
Users & Groups
, enable the 
Guest User
 account and restrict their ability to modify system files.

Limit the Guest account’s Terminal access
:

Disable Terminal
 for the Guest user by removing Terminal from the 
Applications folder
 for that user.

Or, use a tool like 
Parental Controls
 to prevent them from using Terminal.

🚀 Step 5: Enable System Integrity Protection (SIP)

System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 helps prevent 
critical system files
 from being modified, even by the root user.

Ensure SIP is enabled
:

To check SIP status, run:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

If SIP is disabled, you can 
re-enable it
 by following these steps:

Restart your Mac in 
Recovery Mode
 (hold 
Command + R
 while booting).

Open 
Terminal
 from the 
Utilities
 menu.

Run the command:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

Restart your Mac.

🚀 Step 6: Monitor and Restrict Shell Access

You can limit which users have access to 
Terminal
 or the 
bash/zsh
 shell.

Restrict access to Terminal
:

You can remove the ability for other users to access 
Terminal
 by editing their 
profile
.

Modify the 

/etc/shells

 file to only include authorized shell paths (like 
/bin/bash
 or 
/bin/zsh
 for yourself).

Limit access to specific users
:

You can prevent certain users from logging into the system by adding them to the 
“no login” shell
.

Example:

sh

Copy

sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin <username>

This command sets the user's shell to 
nologin
, effectively disabling shell access.

🚀 Step 7: Audit and Monitor System Activity

Use monitoring tools to track and alert you to unusual activities, including changes in the system files, processes, or network connections.

LuLu
, 
Oversight
, and other tools you've set up will monitor external processes, but 
you can go further
 by setting up audit trails.

Install Audit Framework
 (
auditd
):

You can use the 
audit framework
 to log system events, including command executions in Terminal.

The command:
