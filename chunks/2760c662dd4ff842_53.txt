ord managers
: To keep your passwords secure, use a password manager so you don't have to remember long, complex passwords and you don’t expose them via keylogging or other risks.

Secure password recovery
: In case you forget your admin password, set up a 
password recovery option
 or enable 
Apple ID recovery
 to regain access to your Mac.

Conclusion:

By using a 
standard user account
 for daily tasks and keeping a 
separate admin account
 for system changes, you make it harder for attackers to access sensitive system settings, and 
you reduce the risk of compromise
 if they are keylogging or trying to gain unauthorized access.

ok cool and so now I want to make sure my router is secure and that dns settings and vans are used (or iCloud relay)

Securing your 
router
, setting up 
DNS settings
, and ensuring that 
VPNs
 (or 
iCloud Relay
) are used are all essential steps for 
securing your network
 and 
privacy
. Here's a step-by-step guide for securing each of these areas:

🚀 Step 1: Secure Your Router

Change Default Login Credentials:

Most routers come with default usernames and passwords (often "admin" for both). Change these immediately to something 
strong
 and 
unique
.

Access the router’s settings by entering its 
IP address
 in your browser (typically something like 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
). Refer to your router's manual for the exact IP address.

Change the admin username and password
 under the "Administration" or "Security" section.

Enable WPA3 Encryption
:

WPA3 is the latest and most secure Wi-Fi encryption standard. It’s a good idea to enable it (if your router supports it) for 
maximum security
.

Go to the 
Wi-Fi settings
 of your router and set the 
Wi-Fi encryption
 to WPA3. If WPA3 is unavailable, use WPA2.

Disable Remote Management
:

Disable 
remote management
 on your router. This prevents anyone from accessing the router's settings over the internet.

In the router’s admin settings, look for 
Remote Management
 or 
Remote Access
 and disable it.

Change the Default SSID (Wi-Fi Name)
:

Change the 
Wi-Fi SSID
 (network name) to something unique that 
doesn't identify the router model
 or your location.

This adds a layer of obfuscation to make it harder for attackers to identify your router.

Enable a Guest Network
:

If guests need access to your Wi-Fi, enable a 
guest network
. Make sure this network is 
isolated from your main network
 so that guests cannot access your devices.

Update Router Firmware
:

Ensure that your router firmware is up to date to protect against vulnerabilities. Check your router’s admin page for firmware updates and apply them regularly.

🚀 Step 2: Use Secure DNS Settings

Switch to Privacy-Focused DNS Servers
:

Using DNS servers that prioritize 
privacy and security
 is essential. Consider switching to a third-party DNS service that doesn’t track your browsing activity.

Here are a few popular options:

Cloudflare DNS
 (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1): A fast and privacy-respecting DNS service.

Google DNS
 (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4): A widely used and secure DNS service.

OpenDNS
 (208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220): Provides DNS filtering and security features.

Set Custom DNS in Router Settings
:

Log into your router’s settings (as mentioned in Step 1).

Find the 
DNS settings
 section (usually under 
Internet
 or 
WAN settings
).

Replace the default DNS servers with one of the options listed above.

Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS
:

If your router supports it, enable 
DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
 or 
DNS-over-TLS
. This encrypts your DNS queries, making them harder for attackers to intercept.

🚀 Step 3: Use VPNs or iCloud Relay for Privacy

Use a VPN for Network Traffic Privacy
:

A 
VPN
 (Virtual Private Network) routes your internet traffic through a secure server, hiding your IP address and encrypting your connection.

There are many good VPN providers, including:
