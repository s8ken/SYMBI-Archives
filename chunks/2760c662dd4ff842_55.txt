 your IP changes.

Remote Monitoring
:

For security purposes, if you're setting up monitoring or surveillance equipment that needs external access, DDNS would be useful.

🚀 Do You Need DDNS?

It depends on what you're trying to do with your network:

If you’re just securing your network and improving privacy (e.g., using VPN, securing DNS settings)
, 
DDNS isn’t necessary
.

You’ll be 
fine without DDNS
 unless you plan to regularly access your home network remotely from outside.

If you need remote access to your network
 (e.g., VPN access or a server you want to access from another location), then 
DDNS would be useful
.

🚀 Should You Set Up DDNS?

If you do decide to use 
DDNS
, here's how you can proceed:

Choose a DDNS provider
:

Some popular DDNS providers are:

DynDNS

No-IP

DuckDNS

 (Free and easy to use)

Configure DDNS on your Router
:

Log into your router's settings (by typing 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
 in your browser).

Look for the 
DDNS
 or 
Dynamic DNS
 settings in the 
WAN
 or 
Internet settings
.

You will need to input the 
DDNS provider's settings
 (e.g., username, password, and hostname).

For example, if you use No-IP:

You’ll need to sign up for a 
No-IP account
.

Follow the instructions to configure No-IP's 
DDNS service
 with your router.

Test Remote Access
:

Once DDNS is set up, try accessing your network remotely using the hostname provided by the DDNS service (e.g., 
home123.dyndns.org
).

If it's working, you'll be able to access your home network even if your 
public IP
 changes.

🚀 Alternative Solution: Use VPN for Remote Access

If you're worried about security when accessing your network remotely and you're looking to 
restrict access
, a 
VPN
 is a 
better option
 than using DDNS. With a VPN:

You can encrypt your connection when accessing your home network.

It also allows you to 
restrict access
 and ensure that only authenticated users can connect.

You can 
set up VPN
 on your router or on specific devices.

Next Steps:

If you're 
not interested in remote access
 or 
hosting servers
, 
DDNS is not necessary
.

If you are, follow the instructions above to set up 
DDNS
.

Consider using a VPN
 if you need secure remote access.
