, you can use the 
command prompt/terminal
 on your computer:

On 
Mac
 or 
Windows
, open the terminal/command prompt and type:

bash

Copy

nslookup google.com

This will return the IP address associated with 
google.com
, confirming that DNS queries are being resolved through your new DNS servers.

Optional: Enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) if Supported

Some newer Netgear routers may support 
DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
 for enhanced privacy. If your model supports it, you can enable it in the DNS settings. 
DNS-over-HTTPS
 encrypts DNS queries, preventing third parties from intercepting or manipulating them.

Summary of DNS Servers to Use
:

Here are a few DNS services you might consider for increased privacy and performance:

Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
: Fast and privacy-focused DNS.

Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
: Reliable and fast DNS.

OpenDNS (208.67.222.222)
: Offers customizable DNS filtering and security.

Conclusion
:

After following these steps, your router will use your selected 
DNS servers
 instead of the default ones from your ISP. This will improve both your 
internet speed
 and 
privacy
.

It seems like the 
DNS settings
 may not be located under the 
WAN Setup
 section directly, which could be the case with your Netgear Nighthawk router model.

Let’s try the following steps to access DNS settings using a different approach, specifically looking in the 
Internet Setup
 or 
LAN Setup
 sections:

Step-by-Step Guide to Locate DNS Settings:

Log into the Router
:

Go to the router login page by typing the router’s IP address (
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
) into your browser’s address bar.

Enter the username and password. The defaults are usually 

admin

 and 

password

, unless you’ve changed them.

Go to "Advanced" Settings
:

In the router’s admin page, click on 
"Advanced"
 from the main navigation menu.

Look for a menu or section labeled 
“Setup”
, 
“Internet”
, or 
“WAN Settings”
. It might be listed under 
Advanced Setup
 or 
WAN Setup
.

Look for DNS Settings under "Internet" or "WAN"
:

Under Advanced Setup or Internet Setup
, there should be a place where you can configure the 
DNS settings
. If it’s not visible, the DNS settings might be automatically handled by your ISP. In this case, look for an option to 
Manually set DNS
 or 
Custom DNS
.

DNS Configuration
 options might look like this:

Primary DNS
: (Enter your preferred DNS server, e.g., 
1.1.1.1
 for Cloudflare or 
8.8.8.8
 for Google)

Secondary DNS
: (Enter a backup DNS server, e.g., 
1.0.0.1
 for Cloudflare or 
8.8.4.4
 for Google)

Change the DNS Servers
:

Select the option
 to manually configure DNS settings. This will allow you to 
enter the DNS addresses
 for your chosen DNS service.

Apply Settings
:

After entering the desired DNS settings, make sure to click 
Apply
 or 
Save
 at the bottom to confirm the changes.

The router might reboot, and your network will start using the new DNS settings.

If You Still Can’t Find DNS Settings in WAN Setup:

If you can’t find the DNS settings under 
WAN Setup
, it could be possible that your router is using a default 
automatic DNS setup
 provided by your 
ISP
. In this case, you might want to look in the 
LAN setup
 or 
DHCP settings
 for options to customize DNS.

Alternatively, you can try the 
router’s mobile app
 (if available) or consult the 
Netgear support documentation
 for your specific router model to locate and modify DNS settings.

Setting DNS on the Devices Directly (Alternative Solution)
:

If the router doesn't provide an easy way to configure DNS settings, you can 
manually set DNS
 on each device connected to your network:

On Mac
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 → 
Network
 → 
Advanced
 → 
DNS
 tab.

Add your preferred DNS servers (e.g., 
1.1.1.1
 for Cloudflare).

On Windows
:

Go to 
Net
