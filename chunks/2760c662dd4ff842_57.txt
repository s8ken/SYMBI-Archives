ok got it - what should I I choose for router Mac address??

ChatGPT said:

When choosing or configuring the 
MAC address
 for your router, the 
MAC address
 (Media Access Control address) is typically assigned by the manufacturer and is used to uniquely identify the device on your network. 
Most routers come with a factory-set MAC address
, and in most cases, you 
don’t need to change it
.

However, in some situations, you may want to configure or 
change the MAC address
 for reasons such as 
privacy
 or 
network configuration
.

When You Might Want to Change the MAC Address:

Privacy Concerns
:

Changing the MAC address can help prevent your 
ISP
 or 
local networks
 from tracking you by your MAC address.

Avoiding Device Restrictions
:

Some networks or ISPs might restrict access based on the MAC address. In these cases, changing your router's MAC address can help you bypass such restrictions.

Bypass ISP Restrictions
:

Some ISPs limit the number of devices that can connect by MAC address. If you change the router’s MAC address, you might be able to 
reset these limits
.

Network Configuration
:

If you’re setting up your router in a specific environment (e.g., for certain advanced network configurations), you might need to manually set a 
custom MAC address
 to avoid conflicts.

How to Change the MAC Address on Your Router:

Step-by-Step Process (Netgear Nighthawk Router)
:

Log Into the Router
:

Open a web browser and go to the 
router login page
 (typically 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
).

Enter your username and password.

Go to Advanced Settings
:

Once logged in, click on the 
"Advanced"
 tab from the main navigation menu.

Locate the MAC Address Settings
:

Find the section for 
"WAN Setup"
 or 
"Advanced Setup"
.

Look for an option related to the 
MAC address
. In some routers, you will see a field called 
"MAC Address Clone"
 or 
"MAC Address"
.

Enable MAC Address Clone (if applicable)
:

If your router has 
MAC Address Clone
 settings, enable it. This allows you to manually set a new MAC address.

Set the MAC Address
:

If you are asked to input a MAC address, you can either use the 
default MAC address
 provided by the router, or you can enter a 
random or custom MAC address
. MAC addresses typically follow the format 
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
, where 
X
 is a hexadecimal digit.

Apply the Settings
:

After setting the desired MAC address, make sure to 
save or apply the changes
.

Your router may restart for the new MAC address to take effect.

What MAC Address Should You Choose?

Default Factory MAC Address
: If you don’t need to change the MAC address, leave it as is. The factory-set MAC address is usually sufficient for most users.

Custom or Random MAC Address
: If you want to manually set it, you can either:

Use a random MAC address generator to ensure uniqueness.

Choose a MAC address that does not conflict with other devices on your network.

Note
: Changing the MAC address can disrupt the connection temporarily, so make sure to apply the changes carefully and restart the router if necessary.

Should You Change Your Router’s MAC Address?

For 
most users
, changing the router’s MAC address 
is not necessary
 unless you have specific privacy or network configuration requirements. The 
default MAC address
 should work fine, but if you're concerned about privacy or need to reset device restrictions, you can change it.
