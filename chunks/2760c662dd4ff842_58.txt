ou don't have a specific reason to change your router's MAC address, it’s usually best to 
leave it as is
.

If you do decide to change it, make sure to pick a 
unique MAC address
 (you can generate one randomly) to avoid conflicts on your network.

my options are Router MAC Address

use default, use computer or use this Mac address (Where I specify)

Given your options:

Use Default
: This option uses the router’s 
factory-assigned MAC address
, which is typically fine for most users. It’s the most 
common
 choice unless you have specific privacy or network configuration requirements.

Use Computer
: This option would allow you to clone the MAC address of your 
computer
. Essentially, your router would adopt the same MAC address as your computer. This can be useful in certain scenarios, like when your ISP or network is only allowing access from specific MAC addresses. However, it’s generally not necessary unless you’re trying to 
bypass restrictions
 or 
mimic your computer's network identity
.

Use This MAC Address (Specify)
: This option allows you to manually input a 
custom MAC address
. You could use this option if you need a 
specific MAC address
 for privacy reasons or other advanced configurations. If you choose this option, you can 
generate a random MAC address
 to ensure it doesn't conflict with any other devices in your network.

Which Option to Choose?

For Most Users
: If you don’t have a specific need to change the MAC address, 
use the default
 MAC address. It’s usually sufficient, and there’s no real need to change it unless you are trying to address particular network restrictions or privacy concerns.

For Privacy or Bypassing Restrictions
: If you’re concerned about tracking or want to avoid your ISP or other networks identifying your device by MAC address, you could opt to 
use a custom MAC address
. You can generate a random MAC address using a MAC address generator.

For Specific Network Configuration
: If you’re trying to replicate the MAC address of a device on your network (like your computer), select 
use computer
.

Recommendation
:

If you are not aiming to hide your device from your ISP or bypass certain network limitations, 
use the default MAC address
. It’s the easiest and most straightforward option for most people. If you are trying to mask your router's identity for privacy reasons, you can go with the 
custom MAC address
 option.

I have privacy and hacking concerns as you know so I think we should specify

Given your privacy and security concerns, specifying a 
custom MAC address
 is a good choice. Here's how you can proceed:

Steps to Set a Custom MAC Address:

Generate a Random MAC Address
:

You can use an online 
MAC address generator
 or generate one yourself.

MAC addresses have a format like 
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
, where 
X
 is a hexadecimal digit (0-9 and A-F).

You can generate a random one using a tool like 
MAC Address Generator

 or simply generate it yourself.

For example:

00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Set the Custom MAC Address on Your Router
:

Log into your router’s admin page.

Under 
Router MAC Address
, select 
"Use this MAC address"
 and 
manually enter
 the random MAC address you generated.

Apply the Changes
:

Save or 
apply the changes
.

Your router will now use the new MAC address instead of the default one.

It might cause a brief disruption in your network connection, so be prepared for a temporary disconnect.

Test the Connection
:

After applying the changes, check to make sure your router is connected to the internet and that your devices are functioning normally.

Why This Is a Good Idea for You
:

By specifying a 
custom MAC address
, you're adding an extra layer of security. Since MAC addresses are often used for tracking devices, using a 
random or custom MAC add
