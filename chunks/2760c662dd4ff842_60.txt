When Should You Not Block Ports?

Essential Services
:

If you rely on certain services (like email or remote access), blocking their ports could cause disruptions. Make sure you know the ports your services use before blocking them.

Active VPN or Remote Access Services
:

If you use a 
VPN
 or other 
remote access
 services, ensure that the required ports (like 1194 for OpenVPN or 443 for HTTPS) are 
not blocked
.

Things to Keep in Mind
:

Test Services After Blocking
:

After blocking ports, verify that your internet connection and services are still working properly.

Use Port Forwarding for Allowed Services
:

For services you want to allow, use 
port forwarding
 instead of opening all ports.

Update Firmware
:

Keep your router firmware up to date, as some ports may be targeted in new vulnerabilities. Regular updates ensure your router has the latest security features.

Conclusion
:

Blocking unused and vulnerable ports can help improve your network security by 
limiting potential attack surfaces
. However, make sure you only block ports you know you don’t need, and remember that some services (like remote desktop or email) require specific ports to be open.

You said:

so is it port forwarding or trigerring?

ChatGPT said:

Both 
port forwarding
 and 
port triggering
 are ways of configuring how data is directed to specific devices on your network, but they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

Port Forwarding
:

Port Forwarding
 is when you explicitly 
forward incoming traffic
 on a specific port from the internet to a specific device or service inside your network.

This is used when you want a service or device on your internal network to be 
directly accessible from the outside world
.

When to use
:

If you're hosting a web server, a game server, or any service that should be accessible from outside your network, you would 
forward
 specific ports.

Common for 
static IP configurations
, where the device/service you're forwarding to will always need the same port to be open.

Port Triggering
:

Port Triggering
 is when you 
allow incoming traffic on specific ports
, but only when a device inside your network sends outbound traffic on a specific port first.

This is useful when you want a port to be opened temporarily when a specific application or service triggers it (for example, when playing a game or using a communication app).

When to use
:

If you want to dynamically open ports only when specific applications on your network are active (for example, gaming consoles or communication apps that require temporary port access).

Port triggering only 
temporarily opens ports
 while the service/application that triggered it is running.

So Which One Should You Use?

For most cases
 where you need to 
permanently open a port
 (e.g., for a web server, VPN, or game server), 
use port forwarding
.

You specify the exact port to be open and direct the traffic to a device inside your network.

For temporary or dynamic port needs
 (e.g., for certain games or applications that only need ports open while they are running), 
use port triggering
.

Summary
:

Port Forwarding
 = 
Permanent access
 (e.g., web servers, gaming servers).

Port Triggering
 = 
Temporary access
 (e.g., gaming or apps that need dynamic port access).

In your case, for security or privacy reasons, 
port forwarding
 would be used if you need to open specific ports for a service, and 
port triggering
 would be used for applications that 
dynamically need access
 to ports when they are active.

Let me know if you need assistance configuring either of these! 😊
