router
, you will typically use the 
Access Control
 or 
Firewall
 settings in the router’s admin interface. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you block ports like 
FTP (21)
, 
Telnet (23)
, 
SMTP (25)
, 
RDP (3389)
, and others.

Steps to Block Ports on Your Netgear Nighthawk Router:

Log into Your Router’s Admin Page
:

Open a web browser and go to the 
router's login page
. The default IP is typically 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
.

Enter your 
username
 and 
password
. If you haven’t changed them, they may be 
admin
 and 
password
 by default (or as set by your ISP).

Navigate to the Advanced Settings
:

Once logged in, click on the 
"Advanced"
 tab in the top navigation menu.

Go to Security or Firewall Settings
:

Under the 
Advanced
 section, look for an option such as 
"Security"
 or 
"Firewall"
.

This section should allow you to configure 
access rules
 or 
port filtering
.

Add a Port Blocking Rule
:

Look for 
"Blocked Services"
 or 
"Port Filtering"
 under Security or Firewall settings.

In this section, you can 
add custom port blocking rules
. Here’s how to block common ports:

Port 21 (FTP)
: For blocking FTP.

Port 23 (Telnet)
: For blocking Telnet.

Port 25 (SMTP)
: For blocking email sending.

Port 3389 (RDP)
: For blocking Remote Desktop Protocol.

To block these ports:

Enter the port number
 (e.g., 
21
 for FTP) in the designated field for 
Inbound or Outbound Ports
.

Choose the action
: Select 
"Block"
 or 
"Deny"
 for the action.

Apply
 the settings to each port you want to block.

Save and Apply the Settings
:

After entering the port numbers you want to block, make sure to 
save or apply
 the changes. This will immediately block those ports from being accessible over the internet.

Restart the Router (Optional)
:

After applying the changes, you may want to 
restart your router
 to ensure the new settings take effect properly.

Example of Ports You Should Block
:

Here is a list of the common ports and the services they are associated with:

Port

Service

Reason to Block

21
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Often used by malware and unsecured file transfers.

23
Telnet
Insecure remote login; should be replaced with SSH (port 22).

25
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer)
Block if not using an email server; prevents spamming.

3389
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
Often targeted for remote access; block unless you use RDP.

445
SMB (Server Message Block)
Can be exploited for network file sharing vulnerabilities.

5900
VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
Often targeted for unauthorized access to your system.

Additional Tips
:

Use VPNs
: If you require remote access to your network (e.g., for work), consider using a 
VPN
 instead of leaving RDP or Telnet ports open.

Test Services
: After blocking ports, make sure all the services you need are still functioning as expected.

Use Strong Passwords
: Ensure that all services that remain open are secured with strong, unique passwords.

Conclusion
:

Blocking common ports will reduce your exposure to certain types of attacks. 
Port forwarding
 or 
triggering
 should only be used if you need to allow specific services or devices to communicate through your router. For added security, blocking ports that are 
not in use
 will reduce the chance of exploitation.

would it be block sites or block services perhaps?

On your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
, the option you're likely looking for would be 
"Block Services"
, not "Block Sites." The reason for this is that 
"Block Services"
 allows you to 
block specific ports
 or protocols that are commonly used for services like FTP, Telnet, and RDP, which is what you're trying to accomplish.
