3), RDP (Port 3389), etc.

This feature is what you would use to block services that rely on certain ports to function. This is the setting you want to use if you're trying to block common ports for security reasons.

Block Sites
 (Not What You Need):

Block Sites
 generally allows you to block 
websites
 or 
URLs
, not services or specific ports. You would typically use this if you want to prevent access to certain websites by their domain names (e.g., 
example.com
).

While 
block sites
 can be useful for parental controls or restricting access to certain content, it doesn’t work for blocking specific 
network services
 like FTP or RDP.

For FTP (Port 21)
: Enter 
21
 in the 
port field
 and select 
"Block"
.

For Telnet (Port 23)
: Enter 
23
 and block it.

You said:

so block sites is talking about key words and seems ore like a filter

ChatGPT said:

Yes, you're correct! 
"Block Sites"
 on your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
 is more of a 
content filter
. It allows you to block 
websites
 based on their 
domain names
 or 
keywords
 (e.g., blocking any site containing "gambling" or "socialmedia" in the URL).

It is not used to block 
network services
 or 
ports
 like FTP, Telnet, or RDP. Instead, it's meant to restrict access to specific 
websites
 or 
categories
 of content.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

Block Sites (Content Filter)
:

Purpose
: Blocks access to specific 
websites
 based on 
URLs
 or 
keywords
.

Use Cases
:

Restrict access to websites (e.g., social media, adult content, or gaming sites).

Block access to specific domains (e.g., 
example.com
).

How it works
: The router uses a list of 
URL patterns
 or 
keywords
 to block access. This is typically used for 
parental controls
 or 
network usage control
 but not for blocking services like FTP or RDP.

Block Services (Firewall / Port Blocking)
:

Purpose
: Blocks access to specific 
network services
 or 
ports
 used by various applications and protocols.

Use Cases
:

Block services like 
FTP
, 
Telnet
, 
RDP
, and other ports commonly used by hackers to access or control systems.

Restrict access to certain types of traffic or applications (e.g., blocking Remote Desktop or file sharing protocols).

Summary
:

Block Sites
 = 
Website filtering
 based on domains or keywords.

Block Services
 = 
Port filtering
 to restrict network services and protocols.

For your goal of securing your network by blocking ports like 
FTP (21)
, 
Telnet (23)
, 
RDP (3389)
, etc., you would need to use the 
Block Services
 feature (or something similar, depending on your router’s specific settings).
