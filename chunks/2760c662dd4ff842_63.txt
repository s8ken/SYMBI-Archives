 specific devices
 (like computers, phones, or tablets) from accessing your network based on their 
MAC address
. This is a great feature for controlling which devices can connect to your network, but it is 
not the same as blocking network services
 like FTP or RDP.

What is Access Control?

Access Control
 enables you to create a 
list of allowed or blocked devices
 on your network.

It works by filtering devices based on their 
MAC address
 (a unique identifier for each network device).

It is 
useful for limiting which devices can access your network
, but it does 
not control which ports or services are available on your network
.

How Does Access Control Work?

Allow or Block Devices
:

You can set up rules that 
allow only certain devices
 (based on MAC address) to access your network. For example, you might allow your 
laptop and smartphone
, but block your 
neighbor’s device
.

Device-Specific Access
:

This setting doesn’t block services or ports but controls which devices can 
connect to your router
 in the first place.

When to Use Access Control?

If you want to 
restrict access to your network
 to only trusted devices, 
Access Control
 is very useful.

Example
: You could block any unknown devices from connecting to your Wi-Fi network by only allowing devices you specifically add to the list.

It’s not typically used to block specific services or ports like FTP, RDP, or Telnet.

How to Use Access Control to Block Devices on Your Netgear Nighthawk Router
:

Log into Your Router
:

Open a browser and go to 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
 to access your router settings.

Log in using your 
username
 and 
password
.

Navigate to Access Control Settings
:

Under the 
"Advanced"
 tab, look for 
"Security"
 or 
"Access Control"
.

You should see an option like 
"Access Control"
 or 
"Device Access List"
.

Add Devices to Allow or Block
:

Here, you can 
allow or block
 devices by entering their 
MAC addresses
.

You’ll typically see a list of 
connected devices
 (with their MAC addresses).

Choose 
allow
 for devices you trust and 
block
 for devices you want to prevent from connecting.

Apply Settings
:

Save or 
apply
 the settings after adjusting the access control list.

Summary
:

Access Control
 is 
device-specific
 and is used for managing 
which devices can connect to your network
. It’s a great way to 
block unauthorized devices
.

For blocking specific 
ports or services
 like 
FTP (21)
 or 
RDP (3389)
, you’ll need to use the 
Port Forwarding/Port Filtering
 or 
Block Services
 options.

Access Control
 to allow/block specific devices or need help with 
port filtering

Here’s a list of commonly used 
TCP ports
 that you may want to consider blocking for security:

Commonly Blocked TCP Ports:

Port 21 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
:

Used for transferring files between a server and a client. Often targeted by attackers if not secured.

Port 23 - Telnet
:

Used for remote command-line access to a server or device. It is unencrypted and should be blocked unless absolutely necessary.

Port 25 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
:

Used for sending email. If you're not running your own mail server, blocking this port can prevent spammers from using your network.

Port 53 - DNS (Domain Name System)
:

This port is used for resolving domain names to IP addresses. Typically, you don’t need to block this unless you have specific security concerns.

Port 80 - HTTP
:

Used for standard web traffic. If you're not running a web server on your local network, you may choose to block it, though this can interfere with most browsing.

Port 110 - POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)
:

Used for retrieving email from a mail server. If you're not using this protocol for email, you can block it.

Port 143 - IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
:

Used for accessing email from a server. Block if you're not using IMAP.

Port 443 - HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
:

Used for secure web traffi
