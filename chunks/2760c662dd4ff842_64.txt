c (encrypted). This port is typically open by default because it’s necessary for most secure web browsing.

Port 3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
:

Used for accessing Windows machines remotely. This port is often targeted for brute force attacks, so it's advisable to block if you're not using remote desktop.

Port 445 - SMB (Server Message Block)
:

Used for file sharing on Windows. Blocking this can protect your network from SMB-related vulnerabilities and attacks.

Port 5900 - VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
:

Used for remote access to graphical desktops. If you’re not using VNC, block it to prevent unauthorized access.

Port 6660-6669 - IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
:

Used for chat services. Block if you're not using IRC servers.

Port 8080 - HTTP Alternate (often used by proxies and caches)
:

Used for web traffic but often associated with 
proxies
 and 
unauthorized services
. If not needed, block it.

Port 8443 - HTTPS Alternative
:

Sometimes used for web traffic on alternate secure ports. Block it if you're not running any services on that port.

Additional Notes:

Ports 80 and 443
 are 
necessary for web browsing
, so avoid blocking them unless you have a very specific reason to do so.

You can block 
Port 3389 (RDP)
 if you don’t use 
Remote Desktop
 or similar services to access other devices remotely.

Port 445 (SMB)
 should be blocked if you're not using Windows file sharing, as it's often targeted by malware and exploits.

Blocking 
Port 25 (SMTP)
 can prevent malicious users from sending spam through your network.

By selectively blocking these ports, you can reduce your network’s vulnerability to external attacks and intrusions.

what is 7648?

ChatGPT said:

Port 
7648
 is used by the 
Quorum Communications
 protocol. It's associated with some 
backup
 and 
high-availability (HA)
 systems, specifically with 
Symantec Backup Exec
 (a data protection software). This port is used for communication between servers in the context of 
data backup management
 and 
server clustering
.

Summary of Port 7648:

Port 7648
 is primarily used for communication in 
backup
 systems or 
clustering solutions
.

Symantec Backup Exec
 uses it for communication between its servers in a 
high-availability
 or 
backup replication
 setup.

Should You Block Port 7648?

If you 
don't use Symantec Backup Exec
 or any software that requires 
Quorum Communications
, you can 
block port 7648
 for security.

If you have 
no need for backup or high-availability systems
 that use this protocol, blocking this port is a good idea to reduce potential attack vectors.

in the list it comes up as cu-seeme

ChatGPT said:

Ah, that makes sense! If 
Port 7648
 is listed as 
CU-SeeMe
, it is related to the 
CU-SeeMe video conferencing software
. 
CU-SeeMe
 was one of the early video conferencing applications developed in the 1990s and used for both 
audio and video
 communication over the internet.

CU-SeeMe (Port 7648):

Port 7648
 is used by 
CU-SeeMe
 for 
video conferencing
 communication.

This software was particularly popular in the early days of internet video calls, though it has mostly been replaced by other video conferencing software in more recent years.

Should You Block Port 7648 (CU-SeeMe)?

If you are not using CU-SeeMe
 for video conferencing or any software related to it, you can safely 
block Port 7648
.

Blocking unused or unnecessary ports is always a good practice for increasing network security, especially for services like video conferencing that could potentially be used for unauthorized access if left open.

How to Block CU-SeeMe (Port 7648)
:

If you're using a router like the 
Netgear Nighthawk
, you can block this port through the 
Port Forwarding
 or 
Blocked Services
 options in the router's settings.
