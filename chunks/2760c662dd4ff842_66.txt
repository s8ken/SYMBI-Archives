want to connect but I ave noticed with more modern apple equipment that the Mac address changes to protect them how do I manage this?

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right! With modern Apple devices, such as iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, 
Apple has introduced a feature
 that 
randomizes the MAC address
 when connecting to Wi-Fi networks to 
protect user privacy
. This means that the 
MAC address
 that appears to the router can change, making it difficult to rely solely on MAC address filtering for 
device access control
.

Managing Device Access with MAC Address Randomization:

1. Disable MAC Address Randomization (If Needed)

You can 
disable the MAC address randomization
 feature for your Apple devices. This ensures that the 
same MAC address
 is used each time the device connects to a Wi-Fi network, making it compatible with 
MAC address filtering
.

Here's how to disable 
MAC address randomization
:

For iPhone/iPad
:

Go to 
Settings
 > 
Wi-Fi
.

Tap the 
i
 icon next to the connected network.

Toggle off 
Private Address
 (this option randomizes the MAC address).

Once disabled, the device will use its 
real MAC address
 when connecting to this specific Wi-Fi network.

For MacBook
:

Open 
System Preferences
 > 
Network
 > 
Wi-Fi
.

Click on the 
Advanced
 button and locate the network you're connecting to.

Disable 
Private Address
 (if available), which will stop randomization for that network.

2. Use DHCP Reservation (Static IP Address)
:

Another way to manage device access is by using 
DHCP Reservation
. Even if the MAC address changes, the router can assign a 
static IP address
 to your device based on its MAC address. This way, your device will always receive the same IP address, even if the MAC address randomization feature is on.

Here’s how to set up 
DHCP reservation
 on a Netgear Nighthawk router:

Log into the Router
: Go to 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
 and log in.

Navigate to LAN Setup
: Look for 
LAN Setup
 or 
DHCP Settings
.

Enable DHCP Reservation
:

Find the 
"LAN Setup"
 or 
"DHCP Reservation"
 tab.

Add your device by entering its 
current MAC address
 and 
desired IP address
 (you can find the MAC address of the device in the Wi-Fi network settings on the device).

Apply and Save
: This will ensure that your device always gets the same IP address based on its MAC address, even if it’s randomized.

3. Manually Add Devices to Access Control
:

With 
Access Control
, after enabling MAC address filtering, you can still manually add devices by specifying their 
MAC addresses
 (even if randomized). The router may ask you to 
add devices by MAC address
, but you’ll need to update this when you see that the MAC address changes due to randomization.

Summary
:

Disable MAC address randomization
 on your Apple devices if you want to use 
MAC address filtering
 on your router.

Alternatively, use 
DHCP reservation
 to assign a 
static IP address
 to your devices, even if their MAC address changes.

Access Control
 can still be effective for managing which devices can access your network, but you may need to adjust for the MAC address randomization behavior.

Let me know if you need further help setting up these features on your router or devices! 😊

You said:

if its fixed its fine yes it won't change?

ChatGPT said:

Yes, if you 
disable MAC address randomization
 on your Apple devices, the MAC address will be 
fixed
 and will 
no longer change
. This means that the device will always use the same MAC address when connecting to your Wi-Fi network, making it compatible with 
MAC address filtering
 on your router.

So, once you turn off 
MAC address randomization
, you can reliably 
block or allow specific devices
 using 
Access Control
 or 
MAC address filtering
 based on that fixed MAC address.

Summary
:

If MAC address randomization is disabled
, the MAC address 
won't change
, and you can safely use MAC address filtering to control access.

You can 
manually add the fixed MAC address
 to your router
