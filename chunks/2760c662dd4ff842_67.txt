No need to worry about MAC addresses changing
 if randomization is turned off.

If you're ready to disable it on your Apple devices, follow the steps mentioned earlier, and feel free to let me know if you need help with that process! 😊

in my Mac wireless settings I have off, fixed and rotating

In your 
Mac’s wireless settings
, the options for 
MAC address randomization
 are as follows:

Off
:

No MAC address randomization
. The device will always use its 
true, fixed MAC address
 when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. This is the option you want to choose if you want a 
consistent MAC address
 for 
MAC address filtering
 or 
Access Control
 on your router.

Fixed
:

The device uses a fixed MAC address
, but the address remains 
consistent across all networks
. This is similar to the 
"Off"
 setting in that it ensures the MAC address doesn't change, but it can still be a 
non-standard
 MAC address (not the one assigned by the manufacturer).

Best for privacy
 if you want a consistent address that isn't your 
real MAC address
, but still doesn’t change across networks.

Rotating
:

MAC address randomization is enabled
. Your device will 
use a different MAC address
 each time it connects to a new Wi-Fi network. This is meant to 
enhance privacy
 by making it harder to track the device across networks. However, it can interfere with 
MAC address filtering
 and 
Access Control
 on your router since the address changes frequently.

Recommendation for your case
:

If you want to ensure that 
Access Control
 or 
MAC address filtering
 works properly and 
devices don't change their MAC address
, you should 
choose "Fixed"
 or 
"Off"
.

"Off"
 is the best option if you want to use your 
real, manufacturer-assigned MAC address
 for filtering and don't need the privacy benefits of randomization.

"Fixed"
 will still allow you to have a 
consistent, non-random MAC address
 that doesn't change, but it's not the manufacturer-assigned one.

To Disable MAC Randomization Completely:

Select "Off"
 if you want the device to use its 
true MAC address
.

If 
privacy is a concern
 but you still need the MAC address to stay fixed, 
select "Fixed"
.

Let me know if you need help selecting or understanding these options! 😊

ok and does my devices IP address stay the same?

ChatGPT said:

The 
IP address
 of your device will 
not necessarily stay the same
 unless you configure it to do so. This is independent of whether you're using 
MAC address randomization
 or a 
fixed MAC address
.

How IP Addresses Are Assigned:

Dynamic IP (DHCP)
: By default, most devices on a network are assigned 
dynamic IP addresses
. This means the router assigns a different IP address to your device each time it connects to the network (within a specified range, called the DHCP pool).

The 
IP address may change
 over time, especially after a 
reboot
 or 
reconnection
.

Static IP
: If you want to ensure that your device always has the same IP address, you can set a 
static IP address
.

You can either set this manually on your 
device
 or use your 
router’s DHCP reservation
 feature to always assign the same IP to a specific device based on its 
MAC address
.

How to Ensure a Fixed IP Address:

Using DHCP Reservation (Router-side)
:

You can configure your 
router
 to always assign the same IP address to your device based on its 
MAC address
. This method allows you to have a 
consistent IP address
 without manually setting it on your device.

Manually Set Static IP (Device-side)
:

You can also configure your 
MacBook
 or other devices to always use the same IP by setting a 
static IP address
 in the 
Network settings
.

Open 
System Preferences
 > 
Network
.

Select 
Wi-Fi
 (or Ethernet, depending on your connection).

Click 
Advanced
 and go to the 
TCP/IP
 tab.

Set 
Configure IPv4
 to 
Manually
.

Enter the 
IP address
 you want to assign to your device.
