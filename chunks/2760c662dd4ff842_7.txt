Excellent! All remaining remote access services are now fully disabled.

At this point, your Mac is 
completely locked down against unauthorized remote control, network file sharing, and AirPlay exploits.

🛡️ Final Confirmation: Verify Everything is Disabled

Now, let’s double-check that nothing is still running:

Step 1: Confirm Remote & Sharing Services Are Off

Run this command again:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote
sudo launchctl list | grep -i share

🔍 
If no results appear, that means everything is fully disabled.

📌 
Send me the output to verify!

Step 2: Confirm AirPlay Is Off

Run:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay allowAirPlay

🔍 If the output is 
0
, that means 
AirPlay is fully disabled
.

📌 
Once you’ve done these two checks, let me know the results! If everything is confirmed off, your Mac will be as secure as possible against remote intrusions. 🚀

🔍 Final Review: A Few Remote Services Still Appearing

Your output shows that some 
remote-related processes are still listed
, despite being disabled. This could be because 
macOS is still keeping them in memory
 until the next restart.

🚨 Last Step: Force Stop These Services

Let's manually 
kill any remaining remote services
 to ensure they don’t restart.

Run these commands 
one by one
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.RemoteDesktop.PrivilegeProxy
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.RemotePairTool
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remoted
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.coreservices.sharedfilelistd

✅ 
This will forcefully unload them from memory.

🛠️ Final Restart (Optional but Recommended)

After running the above, I recommend 
restarting your Mac
 to ensure everything is fully applied.

1️⃣ 
Run this again after restart to confirm everything is gone:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote
sudo launchctl list | grep -i share

If 
no results appear
, that means your system is 100% locked down.

📌 
Run the above commands, restart if needed, and let me know the final results! 🚀
