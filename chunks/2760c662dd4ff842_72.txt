e.g., IPs not from your ISP or DNS provider).

Action
: Reset your DNS settings to your desired server (e.g., Google DNS: 
8.8.8.8
 / 
8.8.4.4
 or Cloudflare DNS: 
1.1.1.1
). Regularly monitor your DNS settings.

5. Unusual Outbound Traffic

Concern
: 
Outbound traffic spikes
 or connections to unfamiliar external IP addresses could indicate malware or other malicious activity on your network.

What to Look For
: Monitor for 
outbound connections
 to strange or unexpected IPs, particularly if they involve high volumes of traffic.

Action
: Investigate which device is making this connection. If necessary, isolate the device and perform a thorough security check (scan for malware or viruses).

6. UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) Changes

Concern
: UPnP allows devices on your network to automatically open ports. However, this can be exploited by malware to create security vulnerabilities.

What to Look For
: Look for 
unexpected UPnP changes
 in the logs, especially if new ports are being forwarded to your network.

Action
: Disable 
UPnP
 on your router unless you specifically need it. If UPnP is enabled and you see strange port forwarding activity, immediately disable it and change any related security settings.

7. Repeated DHCP Requests

Concern
: 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
 requests from unknown devices could indicate someone trying to 
access your network
 by spoofing a MAC address.

What to Look For
: Repeated DHCP requests with 
new IPs
 being assigned or devices that aren’t recognized as part of your network.

Action
: Use 
static IP assignment
 or 
DHCP reservation
 for known devices. Ensure you’re using 
MAC address filtering
 or 
Access Control
 to limit device access to your network.

8. Remote Management Access

Concern
: 
Remote management
 should be disabled if you don’t need it. If someone gains access to this, they could take control of your router from the internet.

What to Look For
: Look for entries showing 
remote access attempts
 to the router or if the remote management feature has been 
enabled
 without your knowledge.

Action
: Disable 
remote management
 on the router to avoid unauthorized access from outside your network. If it’s necessary, ensure strong security measures, such as 
VPN access
 or 
SSH with key-based authentication
.

9. Time of Log Activity

Concern
: Check for logs showing unusual times of activity or connections when your devices shouldn’t be active.

What to Look For
: Unusual or unexplained activity, especially at 
night
 or when no one is home.

Action
: If you notice activity during odd hours, investigate further to identify if a device was compromised or if unauthorized access is happening.

10. Firmware Updates or Changes

Concern
: 
Firmware tampering
 could indicate someone is trying to exploit vulnerabilities on your router.

What to Look For
: Check if the router’s 
firmware has been updated
 without your knowledge. Many routers have logging for firmware updates.

Action
: Ensure 
automatic updates
 are enabled on your router to apply important security patches. Manually check for updates if you suspect something is wrong.

Key Actions for Router Security
:

Enable a strong password
 for your router’s admin access.

Disable remote management
 unless needed.

Disable WPS
 (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), as it can be insecure.

Use a VPN
 for added privacy if possible.

Set up a guest network
 for visitors to limit access to your main network.

Use a firewall
 on your router to block suspicious traffic.

Regularly check logs
 for any suspicious activity and adjust security settings accordingly.

Conclusion
:

While routers are generally designed to be secure, 
vulnerabilities can still exist
, and 
attacks can happen
 if you don’t stay vigilant. Regularly reviewing the logs, 
disabling unused features
, and 
setting strong passwords
 are essential for securing your router and network. Let me know if you need more assistance with reviewing or securing your router logs
