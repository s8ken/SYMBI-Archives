Based on the log entries you provided, here are some key observations and potential concerns:

1. Multiple Device Connections (DHCP IP Assignments)

Observation
: Devices with MAC addresses 
76:2F:37:97:A2:31
 and 
8E:42:E7:85:20:CD
 are being assigned IP addresses by the router at various times, indicating they are connecting to the network.

Concern
: If these devices are 
unknown
, this could indicate unauthorized devices attempting to access your network. In this case, review the 
MAC addresses
 to ensure that they belong to your devices.

Action
: If you notice unknown devices, block them via 
Access Control
 or 
MAC address filtering
.

2. Admin Logins from Local Network

Observation
: There are 
admin login events
 from local devices (e.g., 
192.168.1.2
 and 
192.168.1.3
).

Concern
: Unauthorized access to your router’s 
admin panel
 can be a serious security risk. If these IPs are not devices you recognize, it could indicate someone is attempting to gain control over your router.

Action
: Make sure the 
admin password
 is strong and not easily guessable. If possible, enable 
two-factor authentication
 for accessing the router settings. If you suspect unauthorized access, change your 
admin credentials
 immediately.

3. WLAN Access Rejected due to Incorrect Security

Observation
: There are several instances where devices (with MAC address 
76:2F:37:97:A2:31
 and 
8E:42:E7:85:20:CD
) attempted to access your network but were 
rejected due to incorrect security
.

Concern
: These rejected access attempts could indicate 
malicious attempts
 to access your Wi-Fi network using incorrect cred
