entials or a security misconfiguration (e.g., a mismatch between the network's WPA2 password and the attempted connection).

Action
: Ensure your 
Wi-Fi password
 is strong, using WPA2 or WPA3 encryption. If the attempts are from devices you don't recognize, 
block them
 from accessing your network.

4. Internet Connectivity Changes

Observation
: Your router logs show 
internet connection drops
 and 
reconnections
 at various times.

Concern
: While these can be normal due to network interruptions, repeated drops or reconnections may indicate potential issues with the router, network interference, or even an attempt to disrupt your internet connectivity.

Action
: Ensure your router firmware is up to date, and check for any network interference or unauthorized access attempts.

Key Actions to Take
:

Change the Admin Password
: If you see any suspicious admin login attempts, change the password to something complex and difficult to guess.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication
 (if possible) for the admin login to add an extra layer of security.

Check Device MAC Addresses
: Ensure all devices listed in the logs are yours. If you notice anything unfamiliar, block those devices from accessing your network using the 
Access Control
 feature.

Use Strong Wi-Fi Security
: Make sure your 
Wi-Fi network
 uses 
WPA2
 or 
WPA3
 encryption, and choose a strong password. Disable older protocols like WEP, as they are insecure.

Review Router Firmware
: Ensure the router firmware is 
up to date
 to patch any potential vulnerabilities.

Monitor for Further Suspicious Activity
: Continue to monitor your logs for unusual activities or changes that may indicate an attempt to exploit or access your router.

Conclusion
:

The logs suggest that there may be unauthorized devices or connection attempts on your network. The first step is to ensure your router’s 
admin credentials
 and 
Wi-Fi password
 are secure and that you have 
access control
 enabled to block any unknown devices. Keeping your router 
firmware up to date
 is essential for protecting against known vulnerabilities.

should I add clock lists to Lulu and where do I get them?

ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can add 
block lists
 (or known malicious IPs and domains) to 
LuLu
 to further enhance your network security. LuLu can block outgoing connections based on these lists, helping prevent your system from communicating with known malicious or suspicious addresses.

What Are Block Lists?

Block lists (also known as 
IP blacklists
 or 
domain blocklists
) contain lists of known malicious IP addresses or domains that should be blocked. By adding them to LuLu, you can prevent any of your applications or services from communicating with those addresses, which could help protect your system from malware, spyware, or other unwanted activity.

How to Add Block Lists to LuLu:

Download Block Lists
:

You can find block lists from various sources on the internet. Some reliable sources for block lists include:

Steven Black's Hosts File
: 
GitHub Repository

Firebog's lists
: 
Firebog DNS Blocklists

EasyList
: 
EasyList GitHub

SomeoneWhoCares
: 
SomeoneWhoCares Hosts File

Use the Hosts File
:

You can download and use 
hosts files
, which can be imported into 
LuLu
. These hosts files will block known malicious websites and IP addresses by redirecting them to 
127.0.0.1
 (the local loopback address).

To import these blocklists into 
LuLu
:

Download the blocklist of your choice.

Convert it into a compatible format if necessary (sometimes you might need to remove extra lines or adjust formatting).

In LuLu, navigate to 
Preferences
 or 
Advanced Settings
.

Look for an option to add custom blocklists or IPs and import your downloaded blocklist.

Use LuLu’s Built-in Filtering
:

LuLu also provides an option to block known 
outgoing traffic
 to specific IPs, which can help prevent apps from reaching malicious ad
