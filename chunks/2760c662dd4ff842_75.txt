dresses. However, LuLu doesn't come with an 
automatic blocklist
 for malicious IPs; you’ll need to import a third-party list for enhanced protection.

Configure LuLu to Block
:

Once your blocklist is added, you can configure 
LuLu
 to monitor or block any outgoing traffic matching the IPs or domains listed. It will notify you when an app attempts to connect to any of the blocked addresses.

Should You Add Block Lists to LuLu?

Yes, adding 
block lists
 is a good way to enhance 
LuLu’s
 effectiveness in blocking outgoing connections to known malicious IPs or domains. This can prevent your system from being compromised or from leaking data to malicious actors, especially if malware or spyware is present.

Important Considerations
:

Performance
: Adding extensive block lists could potentially affect system performance, as LuLu needs to check every outgoing connection against the blocklist.

Update Lists Regularly
: Ensure you regularly update your block lists, as malicious IP addresses and domains change frequently.

Compatibility
: Make sure the blocklists you download are compatible with LuLu’s filtering system or are formatted in a way that LuLu can read them.
