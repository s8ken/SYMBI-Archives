The two files you provided contain blocklists for phishing and general ad/spyware/host blocking. Here's how you can use them to enhance your system's security:

Phishing Filter Hosts
: This list can be used to block phishing sites by redirecting their domain names to a local address (usually 
0.0.0.0
).

General Hosts Blocklist
: This list contains known domains that are involved in advertising, spyware, and other malicious activities.

To use these files with tools like LuLu (to block inbound and outbound traffic), you would typically copy these lists into your firewall/monitoring tool's settings or configure your system's 
/etc/hosts
 file or similar network security configurations. Here's how to set this up:

Steps for LuLu (Outbound & Inbound Monitoring)

Download the list
: Open and save these files to your computer.

Import into Firewall
: If you're using a firewall tool like LuLu or a similar solution, you can:

For LuLu
: You may need to manually add these domain entries to the "Block" list in LuLu, or use the 
hosts
 file method described above to redirect these domains locally.

System Setup
:

Edit 
/etc/hosts
 to include all the lines from the blocklists (
0.0.0.0 <blocked domains>
). This will stop your system from accessing those domains.

Firewall Configuration
:

If using LuLu or another firewall, ensure that the firewall rules are set to monitor outgoing connections. Add these hosts to the blocklists if LuLu supports this functionality.

General Usage in 
/etc/hosts
:

Open the terminal and edit the hosts file with root permissions:

bash

Copy

sudo nano /etc/hosts

Copy and paste all the entries from these lists into the hosts file, prepending 
0.0.0.0
 to the domains.

Save and exit the file (press 
CTRL + O
 to save, then 
CTRL + X
 to exit).

Flush the DNS cache to apply the changes:

bash

Copy

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

These steps should help you block unwanted or malicious connections on both the outbound and inbound fronts. You can monitor network traffic and refine the rules as needed.

Let me know if you'd like further help with a specific configuration or setup!

ok sorry can we start with tip one for the first text file there are the 3 I went with

It looks like you've got a solid blocklist set up in the 
hosts
 file to prevent malicious or phishing sites from being accessed.

The next step is to implement the blocklist into your network monitoring or filtering tools:

LuLu
: You can integrate this list into LuLu's inbound and outbound filters to block access to any known malicious domains and prevent data from being sent to or received from them.

Router DNS Settings
: You can also use this list by configuring DNS filtering (on routers like Netgear) to block traffic from those sites. Some routers support DNS filtering services like OpenDNS, which allows you to import blocklists.

If you want to integrate these into LuLu, you'd need to:

Open LuLu Preferences.

Add rules for each domain or IP address in the lists you want to block under the "Inbound" and "Outbound" tabs.

For router-level DNS filtering:

Enable DNS filtering on your router.

Use a DNS server like 
OpenDNS
 that allows you to import custom blocklists.

Would you like to proceed with integrating these lists into one of these methods, or do you need further help with one of them?

so in Lulu I got to settings?

Yes, to integrate the blocklist into 
LuLu
 and use it for outbound and inbound blocking, follow these steps:
