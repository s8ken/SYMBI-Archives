LuLu
 from your 
Applications
 folder or via Spotlight.

Go to Settings
:

In the LuLu interface, click on 
Preferences
 (usually at the top left or in the menu bar).

Import the Blocklist
:

In the 
Preferences
 window, navigate to 
Advanced Settings
 or similar options (sometimes listed under "Rules").

You should see an option to 
add custom blocklists
 or to 
edit/modify rules
. You might need to manually copy the domains from the blocklist files (e.g., 
phishing-filter-hosts.txt
) into the rule settings.

If the blocklist is in the 
hosts file format
:

Copy the domains (with the 
0.0.0.0
 or 
127.0.0.1
 prefix) from the text file into 
LuLu
’s rule configuration.

Ensure you're blocking 
outbound
 connections (so they don't reach the malicious domain).

Monitor for Alerts
:

Once the rules are added, 
LuLu
 will monitor your outbound and inbound connections. It will alert you when any application tries to communicate with a domain in the blocklist.

Using a Hosts File in LuLu
:

Alternatively, if you're working with a 
hosts file
 format (
127.0.0.1 example.com
), you can:

Directly copy the blocklist content into your system’s 
hosts file
 (i.e., 
/etc/hosts
).

Run the following command in 
Terminal
 to block these addresses:

bash

Copy

sudo nano /etc/hosts

Paste the list from your downloaded blocklist (e.g., 
0.0.0.0 example.com
).

Save the changes and flush the DNS cache:

bash

Copy

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

This will block access to these domains on your whole system.

Great! It sounds like you've found the 
Lists
 tab in LuLu. This is where you can import and manage custom blocklists.

Here's how you can proceed:

Steps to Add a Custom Blocklist Using the "Lists" Tab in LuLu
:

Open LuLu
:

Launch 
LuLu
 from the 
Applications
 folder or via Spotlight.

Go to Preferences
:

Click on 
LuLu
 in the top menu bar and select 
Preferences
, or press 
Cmd + ,
.

Navigate to the "Lists" Tab
:

In the Preferences window, go to the 
Lists
 tab.

Add Your Blocklist
:

In the 
Lists
 tab, there should be an option to 
add a custom list
 or 
import a list
.

Click on "Add"
 or 
"Import"
 (depending on the version), then select the 
blocklist
 file you downloaded (for example, 
phishing-filter-hosts.txt
 or 
hosts.txt
).

Apply the Blocklist
:

Once added, LuLu will start using this list to monitor outgoing and incoming connections to the domains in the blocklist.

Ensure that LuLu is set to 
block outbound connections
 to these domains or IP addresses. It will alert you when an app tries to access one of the domains in the list.

Check LuLu Logs
:

You can view the logs in LuLu to monitor any blocked connections or alerts triggered by these blocklists.

If You Don't See Import Option:

If there's no explicit 
import option
:

You can manually copy and paste the domains into LuLu’s 
blocklist section
 under the 
Rules
 tab.

Let me know if you need further clarification or if you'd like to continue with this setup! 😊

it has an allow list and block list and wants me to specify the file be it doesn't seem to like the txt files

ChatGPT said:

Thanks for the clarification! It looks like LuLu's 
Lists
 tab is asking for a specific format, which might be different from the plain 
.txt
 files you have. Usually, LuLu expects blocklist files to be in a 
proper format
 (like a specific text format with domain names or IPs) that it can directly read.

Here’s what you can do to get the blocklists to work properly in LuLu:

Steps to Convert and Import the Blocklist in the Correct Format

Format the Blocklist File
:

LuLu is likely looking for a 
list of domains or IP addresses
. You can take the 
.txt
 files you've downloaded and extract the relevant domains or IPs.

 files into a format LuLu can u
