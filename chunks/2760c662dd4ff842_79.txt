se:

For each line in your 
.txt
 file
 (e.g., 
phishing-filter-hosts.txt
 or 
hosts.txt
), you should have one domain or IP address on each line, like this:

Copy

0.0.0.0 example.com
0.0.0.0 anotherexample.com
0.0.0.0 maliciousdomain.com

If the file contains other data (like IP addresses), make sure it’s in a format where each entry is on a new line, and the 
domains are prepended with 
0.0.0.0

.

Create a New Blocklist File
:

Open a new 
.txt
 file (e.g., 
luLu_blocklist.txt
) and copy-paste the domains from the blocklist into the file, using the format shown above.

Example
:

Copy

0.0.0.0 example.com
0.0.0.0 ads.example.com
0.0.0.0 phishingdomain.com

Import the New Blocklist into LuLu
:

Go back to 
LuLu's Preferences
 > 
Lists
 tab.

Select "Block List"
, and then browse to select the newly formatted file (
luLu_blocklist.txt
).

Apply
 it and LuLu should now start blocking any outbound or inbound connection to those domains.

Check LuLu Logs
:

Once applied, LuLu will notify you if any application tries to connect to the domains on the blocklist.

Alternative Manual Method
:

If LuLu still does not recognize the 
.txt
 file, you can manually add these domains to the blocklist section:

Copy the domain names from the 
.txt
 file.

Manually add them into the 
Block List
 section in LuLu under the 
Lists
 tab, one per line, in the required format.

Let me know if you encounter any other issues with this or need further help with the conversion process! 😊

It seems I encountered an issue while attempting to format the files. Let me try a different approach to correctly format them for you.

I'll process the files into a properly formatted blocklist and provide you with a working download link. Please give me a moment.
