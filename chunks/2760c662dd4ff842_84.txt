ing 
Ctrl + X
, then 
Y
 to confirm.

Run the following command to flush your DNS cache:

bash

Copy

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

After that, your system will block any access to the domains listed in the hosts file.

4. Use It in a Security Monitoring System
:

If you're using a security monitoring system (like 
Little Snitch
 or 
LuLu
), you can keep the list of blocked domains for real-time alerts and proactive monitoring.

Next Steps
:

LuLu
: Import the file to block domains.

Pi-hole/DNS
: Add the list to your DNS service.

Hosts file
: Append the list to your 
/etc/hosts
 file for local blocking.

I used Lulu 

ChatGPT said:

Great choice with 
LuLu
! Since you've successfully added the list to the 
Block List
 in LuLu, your system should now block any connections to the domains in that list. Here's a quick checklist to make sure everything is working:

Verify that 
LuLu
 is running and actively monitoring your system.

Check that the 
formatted_output.txt
 file is correctly added to the 
Block List
 in 
LuLu
.

Ensure that any outbound or inbound connection attempts to the listed domains are being blocked by 
LuLu
.

If you want to confirm it’s working, you can try accessing one of the blocked domains (either by visiting a website that uses it or running a connection test), and LuLu should show a notification or log entry about the blocked connection.

Let me know if you need any further help with LuLu or anything else!

the last things I'll be doing is to downgrade me to a standard user and add the admin account and complex password 

ChatGPT said:

That sounds like a great final step to enhance your system's security. Here's a quick guide on how to do it:

1. Create a New Admin Account (if you don't have one already)
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 > 
Users & Groups
.

Click the 
lock icon
 in the bottom left and enter your admin password.

Click the 
"+"
 button to create a new user.

Set the 
New Account
 type to 
Administrator
.

Set a 
strong password
 for this new account.

2. Change Your Current Account to Standard
:

In 
Users & Groups
, select your current account.

Click the 
lock icon
 again and enter the password.

Under 
Account Type
, change it from 
Admin
 to 
Standard
.

3. Set a Strong Password for the New Admin Account
:

Ensure your new admin account has a complex, strong password.

Ideally, use a 
password manager
 to store the password securely.

4. Log Out of the Admin Account
:

After setting up the new admin account, log out of your current account and log in to the 
new admin account
.

5. Test Your Setup
:

Ensure that you can perform admin tasks when logged into the new admin account.

Log into your standard account and confirm that you are restricted from making admin changes.

This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your admin privileges, as they will be separated into another account with a complex password.

Let me know if you need more assistance during this process! 😊
