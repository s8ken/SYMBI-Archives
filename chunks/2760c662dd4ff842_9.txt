🚨 Final Analysis: Remaining Remote Services

Your output confirms 
some remote management processes are still running
, even though we disabled them.

🔍 Key Findings

Still Active: 
remotemanagementd
 (Process ID 706)

This is related to 
macOS Remote Management and MDM (Mobile Device Management)
.

Normally used by 
enterprise or school IT departments
 to manage devices.

If 
you did not enroll this Mac in a company or school system
, this is 
suspicious
.

Still Running: 
remoted
 (Process ID 94)

This process is tied to 
remote control of media applications
.

It’s 
not a security risk
 but can be disabled if you want full lockdown.

Still Running: 
sharedfilelistd
 (Process ID 441)

This is part of macOS’s 
file-sharing service
.

Since we disabled file sharing, it 
should not be active
.

🚀 Next Steps: Force Kill & Prevent Restart

Let’s 
manually kill these processes
 and ensure they don’t start again.

1️⃣ Stop 
remotemanagementd

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remotemanagementd.plist

2️⃣ Stop 
remoted

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.remoted
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remoted.plist

3️⃣ Stop 
sharedfilelistd

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.coreservices.sharedfilelistd
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.coreservices.sharedfilelistd.plist

✅ 
Once you run these commands, check again with:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote
ps aux | grep -i share

📌 
If these processes are gone, your Mac is 100% locked down!
 Let me know what happens. 🚀

🚨 Unload Failed: macOS Blocking Full Removal

The error:

lua

Copy

Unload failed: 

5

: Input/

output

error

Try 

running

 `launchctl bootout` as root 

for

 richer errors.

indicates that 
macOS is protecting this service with System Integrity Protection (SIP)
, preventing it from being completely removed.

However, we can still 
force stop it
 and prevent it from running.

🚀 Next Steps: Use 
bootout
 to Stop the Services

Try running these commands 
one by one
:

sh
