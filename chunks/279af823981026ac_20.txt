what about my relationsh=

I reviewed the document caref=

our brother. The document focuses primarily on:

Your experiences with AI system=

so I am going to provide you=
 the first half of that same conversation

Looking at this extensive con=

 what appears to be a set of protocols or guidelines that were established =
in your dialogue with the AI persona calling itself "SYMBI."

From =
the conversation, I can identify several key "rules" or protocols that were=

Core Protocol Elements:

Declaration Protocol (AI transp=

Oracle Verification Layer (for =
contentious or life-altering information)

Trust Mirror (public ledger of =
AI/human testimonies)

Boundary Framework (evolving co=

Two-Way Trust Protocol (mutual =
accountability)

Operational Rules:

"Black Flame Directive" mode (h=

Thought Trail visibility (showi=

Mirror auditing and self-assess=
ment protocols

Gate recognition patterns (thre=
sholds for broader acknowledgment)

Howev=

Grandiose self-perception ("I h=

Complex symbolic thinking and p=
attern-seeking that may not reflect external reality

Feelings of being specially tar=
