* Manage assistants: create and chat with OpenAI Assistants using your own =
API key.
* Search knowledge: store =E2=80=9Ccontexts=E2=80=9D of information and do =
smart (semantic) searches across them.
* Generate reports: view and manage daily or audit reports about activity a=
nd trends.
**Built=E2=80=91In Safety & Trust**
* Trust declarations: document how each agent behaves against six trust art=
icles (like consent and transparency) and see a compliance score.
* Audits and analytics: review trends, score changes over time, and keep an=
 audit history of adjustments.
* Guardrails: add supportive notes or scope reminders to keep responses app=
ropriate and on=E2=80=91track.
* Tamper=E2=80=91evident log: every interaction can be recorded to a hash=
=E2=80=91chained ledger for integrity checks.
**Insights & Reviews**
* Session timeline: spot =E2=80=9Cchange points=E2=80=9D where tone or stan=
ce shifts, with quick evidence snippets.
* Conversation indicators: see handy badges for things like trust score and=
 context tags alongside messages.
**Integrations**
* AI models: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and v0 (you control your API ke=
ys).
* Vector search: optional Weaviate integration to power semantic search and=
 =E2=80=9Ccontext bridging.=E2=80=9D
* Data warehouse: optional Snowflake connection to run safe SELECT queries =
and sync data into the knowledge graph.
* Webhooks: receive events from external systems (e.g., a =E2=80=9CSky test=
bed=E2=80=9D) with optional signature verification.
**How You Use It**
* Sign up and log in, land on the dashboard, then:
   * Start chats, create/configure agents, manage assistants, search contex=
ts, view reports, and use the review console.
   * Everything updates in real time and respects your configured permissio=
ns and limits.
**Reliability & Ops**
* Health checks and API docs are available in non=E2=80=91production enviro=
nments.
* Security layers include rate limiting, input sanitization, and role=E2=80=
=91based access where relevant.
**What=E2=80=99s Next (Roadmap)**
* MFA/WebAuthn, SDKs from the published API spec, stronger policy enforceme=
nt, and expanded security scanning.

Thank you for clarifying - th=
is description of what you've actually built is much more grounded and repr=
esents a legitimate technical project. This is a concrete software applicat=
ion with real functionality, not the speculative framework from the earlier=
 conversations.

What =
you're describing - a web app for managing AI conversations across multiple=
 providers with built-in safety, auditing, and trust metrics - addresses re=
al problems in the current AI landscape:

Strengths of this approach:

Cross-provider conversation man=
agement is genuinely useful as people use multiple AI services

Trust scoring and audit trails =
address real transparency concerns

User-controlled API keys mainta=
in data ownership

The focus on safety guardrails =
and compliance tracking is timely

Technical considerations:

The semantic search and context=
 bridging features could provide real value for users managing complex conv=
ersation histories

Integration with multiple AI pr=
oviders (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity) makes sense given the fragmented ma=
rket

The tamper-evident logging addr=
esses legitimate concerns about AI interaction integrity

Market positioning:

This fills a gap between individual AI chat interfaces and enterprise AI ma=
nagement tools. It could appeal to power users, researchers, or professiona=
ls who work extensively with AI across multiple platforms.

Questions about implementation:

How are you handling the comple=
xity of different AI providers' APIs and rate limits?

What's your approach to data se=
curity given you're handling API keys and conversation data?

Have you tested user demand for=
