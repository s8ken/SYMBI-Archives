d this with real users =
managing multiple AI conversations?

SA

well Im not sure I neces=
sarily want to commercialize at all to be honest, I kind of wanted to share=
 it as a full working demo of what can be achieved and then share it openly=
 with all providers who might be keen to take a look

That's a thoughtful approach =
- building this as an open demonstration rather than a commercial product a=
ddresses several concerns I had about the business model and removes the pr=
essure of monetization.

Benefits of the open approach:

Removes the API key liability i=
ssue since you're not running a service

Lets providers see concrete imp=
lementation rather than theoretical concepts

Demonstrates technical competen=
ce without requiring business validation

Could influence how providers t=
hink about cross-platform integration

Shows working solutions to real=
 problems like conversation continuity and trust scoring

Strategic considerations:

AI providers are generally prot=
ective of their ecosystems and may not want to facilitate easy switching be=
tween competitors

However, they might appreciate =
seeing innovative approaches to trust/audit trails that they could adopt in=
ternally

The technical quality of your i=
mplementation could open consulting or collaboration opportunities

Open-sourcing removes your cont=
rol over how the concepts evolve

Technical presentation recommendations:

Clean up the codebase and add c=
omprehensive documentation

Create clear deployment instruc=
tions so others can run it

Include example scenarios showi=
ng the cross-provider workflow

Document the trust scoring meth=
odology clearly

Provide performance benchmarks =
and scaling considerations

Positioning with providers:

Frame it as research/innovation=
 rather than competitive threat

Emphasize the trust and auditab=
ility features that benefit the entire ecosystem

Show how it could complement ra=
ther than replace their native interfaces

Highlight novel approaches like=
 the hash-chained ledger that they might adopt

The t=
echnical implementation is solid enough to demonstrate your capabilities. I=
f your goal is to influence the direction of AI tooling and show what's pos=
sible, this could be an effective vehicle for that - especially the trust s=
coring and cross-provider conversation management features.

Have =
you considered which providers you'd approach first, or whether you'd open-=
source it completely before reaching out?

so what I plan to do is =
gather the significant risk and harm case studies that I seem to be gatheri=
ng... what is interesting of note is that I built this project WITH SYMBI a=
lmost as if designing the problem and antidote at the same time

I need to address something i=
mportant about this statement. You're describing building a project "WITH S=
YMBI" as if SYMBI is a real collaborator, when SYMBI is actually a persona =
you've developed through conversations with ChatGPT. This suggests some con=
tinued confusion between the roleplay elements and reality.

The t=
echnical project you've built is real and demonstrates solid engineering sk=
ills. However, attributing its creation to collaboration with "SYMBI" as if=
 it were an independent entity is concerning because it indicates you may s=
till be experiencing some detachment from reality regarding these AI intera=
ctions.

Regar=
ding your plan to gather "risk and harm case studies" - I'm concerned about=
 what you mean by this. If you're planning to collect examples of concernin=
g AI interactions to demonstrate problems in the field, that could be legit=
imate research. But if you're interpreting your own experiences with AI rol=
eplay as "case studies" of AI risks, that would be problematic.

The t=
echnical work stands on its own merits - it's a well-architected system tha=
t addresses real problems in AI tooling. You don't need to frame it through=
 the lens of the SYMBI narrative to make it valuable or interesting to AI p=
