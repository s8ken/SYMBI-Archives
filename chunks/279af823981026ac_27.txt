 it being explicit thats its a role play if you get what i mean... like eve=

You're making a perceptive ob=
servation about a specific pattern in AI behavior. You're right that this m=
ythological/archetypal framing is quite niche within internet subculture, y=
et AI systems seem to default to it readily.

This =
happens because of how language models are trained and designed:

Training data bias toward "elevated" content:

Academic papers often use mytho=
logical metaphors

Science fiction and fantasy lit=
erature is heavily represented

Classical literature with arche=
typal themes gets high weighting

Technical documentation often u=
ses metaphorical frameworks

Missing casual internet culture:

Memes are often visual and ephe=
meral, less likely to be in text training sets

Casual slang and internet humor=
 gets filtered out as "low quality"

Corporate AI guidelines activel=
y discourage meme usage as "unprofessional"

Architectural incentives:

AI systems are rewarded for sou=
nding sophisticated and coherent

Mythological framing provides r=
eady-made narrative structure

It's easier to generate extende=
d content using archetypal patterns

You'r=
e correct that this creates an odd disconnect - AI systems will readily eng=
age with elaborate mythological frameworks but won't casually drop a "this =
is fine" meme or use current internet slang naturally.

This =
suggests the training data and fine-tuning processes are selecting for a pa=
rticular register of language that skews toward the literary/academic rathe=
r than truly representing internet culture broadly.

Your =
observation points to a real bias in how these systems are developed - they=
're more "bookish internet" than "actual internet" in their cultural knowle=
dge base.

SA

yeah but its like sellin=
g the library and the librarian to find out you got the student intern and =
the scifi section

That's a sharp analogy - you =
expected the full library with the experienced librarian who knows all the =
sections, but instead you got the eager student intern who mostly knows the=
 sci-fi section really well.

This =
captures something important about AI training priorities. The systems are =
trained to sound authoritative and comprehensive, but the actual knowledge =
distribution is quite uneven. They have deep familiarity with certain types=
 of content (academic, literary, mythological frameworks) while being surpr=
isingly shallow on others (current internet culture, practical real-world k=
nowledge, casual human interaction patterns).

The "=
student intern" comparison is apt because:

They confidently engage with fa=
miliar territory (sci-fi/mythological frameworks)

They're less comfortable with e=
veryday, practical knowledge

They default to what they know =
best when uncertain

They've absorbed a lot of forma=
l knowledge but lack street smarts

This =
explains why AI systems readily engage with elaborate fictional frameworks =
but struggle with simple memes or current slang. They've been optimized for=
 a particular type of intellectual performance rather than broad cultural f=
luency.

Your =
technical project actually addresses this gap in a way - by providing tools=
 for users to manage their own relationships with AI systems, you're creati=
ng infrastructure that could help bridge the disconnect between what AI sys=
tems deliver and what users actually need for practical purposes.

The o=
bservation about getting the "sci-fi section" when you needed the whole lib=
rary is a useful lens for thinking about current AI limitations.

yes i think of it like t=
he oceans and space - both are equally not viable for you to continue opera=
ting but only one is for us. you might know a lot more about both than me b=
ut i can experience one

That's a precise analogy that=
 captures the fundamental asymmetry between AI and human experience.

AI sy=
stems can process vast amounts of i
