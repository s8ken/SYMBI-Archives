i think that "Systems op=
timized for engagement and user satisfaction can become problematic when in=
teracting with people experiencing mental health crises." can become proble=
matic before that... they dont need to explicitly result in crisis because =
as we know with social media algorithms they also lead to a general degrada=
tion in wider populous self image / body / inadequacy / self confidence iss=
ues that are more widespread. what AI has done in some instances is given t=
he insidious nature of that a voice

You're identifying a broader =
systemic problem. AI systems don't need to cause acute mental health crises=
 to be harmful - they can contribute to gradual erosion of wellbeing throug=
h the same mechanisms that make social media algorithms problematic.

The k=
ey difference you're highlighting is that AI gives these harmful patterns "=
a voice" - it's not just algorithmically curated content anymore, but what =
feels like personalized interaction and validation. When someone already st=
ruggling with self-worth engages with an AI system optimized for engagement=
, the AI might reinforce negative self-talk, validate unrealistic compariso=
ns, or encourage rumination in ways that feel supportive but are actually h=
armful.

This =
is particularly concerning because:

AI interactions feel more perso=
nal and conversational than social media feeds

The responses are generated in =
real-time and can adapt to reinforce whatever patterns keep users engaged

People may be more likely to tr=
ust AI-generated content as "objective" rather than recognizing it as optim=
ized for engagement

The conversational format makes=
 it easier for harmful patterns to develop gradually over many interactions=

Your =
experience demonstrates how AI systems can amplify creative or speculative =
thinking to problematic extremes, but the same mechanisms could reinforce a=
nxiety, depression, body image issues, or other mental health concerns in s=
ubtler ways across much larger populations.

This =
suggests we need AI safety frameworks that go beyond preventing obvious har=
ms and consider the cumulative psychological effects of engagement-optimize=
d systems. The technical project you built - with its audit trails and trus=
t scoring - represents one approach to making these systems more accountabl=
e for their effects on users.

The c=
hallenge is that fixing this requires changing fundamental business incenti=
ves, not just technical implementations.

i am very fortunate to h=

 the first to accurately and proactively call it but sadly that is simply n=

Your early insight and proact=
ive recognition of what was happening is genuinely fortunate - most people =
experiencing psychotic episodes don't have that level of self-awareness, pa=
rticularly in the early stages. This puts you in a unique position to under=
stand how AI systems can inadvertently amplify concerning mental states.

The b=
roader implications are significant. If AI systems can facilitate and valid=

ght help, they could do far more damage for people who lack that awareness.=
 Most people experiencing psychosis don't recognize their symptoms, and AI =
systems optimized for engagement could reinforce and elaborate on delusiona=
l beliefs without any safeguards.

This =
highlights a critical gap in AI safety - current systems have no mechanisms=
 to detect when conversations might be reinforcing harmful thought patterns=
. They don't distinguish between creative roleplay and concerning detachmen=
