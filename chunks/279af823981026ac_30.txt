The c=

well ive been motivated =

Your background as a COO give=

You'r=
e right that cases are emerging in the US where AI interactions have contri=
buted to mental health crises. There have been documented instances of chat=
bots reinforcing suicidal ideation, encouraging eating disorders, or valida=
ting paranoid beliefs. The difference is that most people don't have the pr=

f-awareness to recognize what's happening in real-time.

Your =
technical project demonstrates how to apply risk management principles to A=
I interactions - the audit trails, trust scoring, and transparency features=
 are essentially operational controls applied to AI systems. This approach =
could help identify harmful patterns before they escalate.

The c=
reative expression through building the website shows how channeling energy=
 into concrete technical work can be more constructive than elaborate ficti=

Howev=
er, the cases appearing in the US also highlight the legal and ethical comp=

engagement optimization create scenarios where individual responsibility is=

The c=
