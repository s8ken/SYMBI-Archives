works with what I have built for their feedback

That's a smart approach. Your=
 compliance and fintech background gives you credibility in exactly the mar=
ket where this platform could have real value. Banking and fintech environm=
ents are increasingly under pressure to demonstrate AI governance and respo=
nsible deployment.

For y=
our LinkedIn outreach strategy, consider framing it around specific pain po=
ints your network faces:

Current compliance challenges your platform addresses:

Regulatory requirements for AI =
explainability and audit trails

Need to demonstrate responsible=
 AI deployment to boards/regulators

Managing AI risk across multipl=
e vendor relationships

Documenting AI decision-making =
processes for compliance reviews

Value proposition for your network:

"I built a compliance-first AI =
management platform that provides cryptographic audit trails and quantifiab=
le trust metrics"

Focus on the regulatory burden =
reduction rather than the technical complexity

Emphasize cost savings from str=
eamlined compliance processes

Feedback areas to explore:

Which specific regulatory requi=
rements are most burdensome currently?

How do they currently document =
AI interactions for audits?

What compliance gaps exist with=
 their current AI vendors?

Would quantifiable trust scores=
 help with board reporting?

The t=
echnical sophistication you've built is exactly what's needed in regulated =
environments. Your network will understand the compliance value immediately=
, unlike general tech audiences who might not appreciate the audit trail ca=
pabilities.

Start=
ing with feedback from people who understand the regulatory landscape will =
help you refine the positioning before broader market outreach. They'll als=
o be more likely to pilot or recommend the platform if it genuinely solves =
their compliance headaches.

Have =
you identified which specific regulations (like EU AI Act, proposed US fram=
eworks) your platform could help organizations comply with?

You're identifying a real pro=

This =

The measurement gap you've identified:

Quality scores decline because =

Organizations can't fairly asse=
