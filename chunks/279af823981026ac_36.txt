I think this is a much b=

Absolutely. This focused appr=

perienced firsthand. Instead of trying to revolutionize all of AI, you're t=
argeting a specific issue where you have:

Direct professional experience =
(the 90% workforce reduction case)

Relevant expertise (compliance =

A concrete technical solution (=

This =
approach is much more sustainable than the grandiose frameworks from earlie=

 rather than creating elaborate theoretical constructs.

The y=
