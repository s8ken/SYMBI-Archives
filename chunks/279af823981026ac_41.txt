The A=
I code review approach you're using helps catch logic issues and suggests i=
mprovements, but automated tools can catch different types of problems - pe=
rformance bottlenecks, security patterns, accessibility issues, and edge ca=
ses that might not be obvious during manual review.

Since=
 you're targeting compliance teams, pay particular attention to security sc=
anning results. They'll expect robust security practices, and having docume=
ntation of your testing process adds credibility.

Runni=
ng multiple types of automated tests gives you confidence that different as=
pects of the system work properly before your manual stress testing phase.

I know right - how's my =
choice of audience for a first project hahah OMG

Ha! You picked probably the m=
ost demanding possible audience for a first software project. Compliance te=
ams in banking and fintech are notoriously thorough, risk-averse, and will =
scrutinize everything. They're the people who find edge cases that break sy=
stems and ask detailed questions about security architecture.

On on=
e hand, it's terrifying - they'll notice if anything doesn't work perfectly=
. On the other hand, if you can build something that passes their standards=
, you've essentially built enterprise-grade software. There's no faking it =
with compliance professionals.

The f=
act that you're approaching this with proper automated testing, security sc=
anning, and comprehensive manual testing shows you understand what you're g=
etting into. They'll expect documentation, audit trails, and bulletproof se=
curity - which your platform actually provides.

Your =
compliance background probably influenced this choice unconsciously. You kn=
ow what these teams need because you've been in their shoes. That domain kn=
owledge is valuable, even if it means higher technical standards.

Bette=
r to start with the hardest audience and nail it than build something that =
only works for casual users. If compliance teams approve it, everyone else =
will trust it too.

Just =
make sure your stress testing is absolutely thorough before you show it to =
them. They have zero tolerance for "this usually works" or "that's a known =
issue we're fixing."

thats okay because thats=
 my background myself - your right it did influence my choice and if I can =
nail something of that standard that will certainly be an achievement but e=
ven if I go down in flames its a learning opportunity but I plan to mitigat=
e that through this testing and then even hire someone on fivr who can do a=
 human review for me

That's a smart mitigation str=
ategy. Having someone on Fiverr do an independent human review before you a=
pproach your professional network reduces the risk of exposing incomplete w=
ork to people whose opinions matter for your career.

Your =
compliance background definitely gives you an advantage here - you understa=
nd the standards and expectations these teams have. You know they'll want t=
o see proper documentation, security considerations, and reliable functiona=
lity. That insider knowledge of what they're looking for is valuable, even =
if it means building to higher standards.

The "=
going down in flames" attitude is realistic. Not every project succeeds, bu=
t the skills you've developed building this platform are transferable regar=
dless. Web development, security architecture, API integration - these are =
all marketable capabilities.

Using=
 multiple testing approaches (automated tools, AI code review, manual stres=
s testing, plus an independent human reviewer) shows you
