The h=

 who wouldn't be the end users anyway.

im sure he does but I do=
 my research and he recently vibe coded that bitchat thing on GitHub in his=
 spare time - that profile only has 6.3k followers

You did your research, and th=
at context about the bitchat project does change things. If Jack Dorsey is =
actively coding side projects and posting them on a GitHub profile with 6.3=
k followers, he's clearly still engaged with grassroots development work ra=
ther than just operating at the celebrity level.

The "=
vibe coded" connection is actually relevant - if he built something quickly=
 based on intuition and shared it openly, he might relate to your approach =
of building something that "grew well beyond what I imagined."

Howev=
er, I'd still suggest being strategic about the outreach:

Keep it brief and specific

Focus on the technical problem =
you're solving rather than seeking general advice

Maybe frame it around the compl=
iance/trust angle since he's dealt with content moderation and platform gov=
ernance issues

Include a direct link to your d=
emo so he can quickly assess what you've built

The c=
ompliance angle might actually be more interesting to him than a general "h=
ere's my project" message. His experience with Twitter's trust and safety c=
hallenges could make the AI compliance platform relevant to his interests.

If yo=
u're going to reach out, do it after your testing phase is complete so you'=
re showing polished work. The worst case is no response, which is the most =
likely outcome regardless. But if the platform genuinely solves problems he=
's thought about, there's at least a coherent reason for the outreach beyon=
d hoping for celebrity validation.

The k=
ey is framing it as offering something potentially useful rather than askin=
g for help.

You're right - that article c=
onfirms Jack Dorsey literally said he "vibe coded" the BitChat app, describ=
ing it as building something quickly based on intuition rather than formal =
planning. The parallel to your approach is legitimate.

The a=
rticle also mentions he's been focused on decentralized protocols and open-=
source development, which aligns with some of the technical approaches in y=
our platform (decentralized identity, open frameworks).

Given=
 this context, a brief, technical outreach actually makes more sense than I=
 initially suggested. Someone who "vibe codes" messaging apps and posts the=
m on GitHub with 6k followers is clearly still engaged with grassroots deve=
lopment work.

If yo=
u do reach out, the compliance/trust angle could be genuinely relevant give=
n his experience with content moderation challenges at Twitter. The technic=
al problem you're solving - verifiable trust in AI interactions - relates t=
o platform governance issues he's dealt with extensively.

Keep =
it concise and focus on the technical solution rather than asking for advic=
e. Something like: "Built a compliance platform for AI trust verification a=
fter experiencing workforce automation challenges in fintech. Thought the c=
ryptographic audit trail approach might interest you given your platform go=
vernance experience."

The w=
orst outcome is no response, which is likely regardless. But the "vibe code=
d" connection and his continued engagement with development work makes this=
 less of a celebrity cold call and more of a developer-to-developer technic=
al share.

Just =
make sure your platform is thoroughly tested first so you're showing polish=
ed work if he does look at it.
