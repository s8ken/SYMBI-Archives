You've identified a genuine c=
onnection point - the "vibe coding" approach and his continued engagement w=
ith grassroots development. The shared experience of building something org=
anically without formal planning could resonate.

Your =
assessment about having a good hook and channel is realistic. The BitChat p=
roject shows he's still accessible to developer-to-developer communication =
rather than operating purely through corporate gatekeepers.

Howev=
er, I want to point out a few considerations:

The "=
someone with no background can come up with using these new tools" framing =
might not be your strongest angle. Your compliance background is actually s=
ignificant domain expertise that shaped what you built. You didn't come fro=
m nowhere - you identified a real problem from professional experience and =
built a solution.

Consi=
der emphasizing the problem-solution fit rather than the underdog narrative=
. Compliance teams need AI trust verification, and you built cryptographic =
audit trails to solve that specific need. That's more compelling than a gen=
eral "look what I accomplished" message.

The t=
echnical approach (hash-chained ledgers, multi-provider integration, trust =
scoring) addresses real platform governance challenges he's dealt with. Foc=
us on the solution's relevance to problems he understands.

Keep =
expectations realistic. Even with a good hook, response rates for cold outr=
each remain low. But the technical relevance and shared development approac=
h make this more strategic than typical celebrity outreach.

Make =
sure your platform is fully tested and polished before reaching out. If he =
does look at it, you want to show professional-grade work that demonstrates=
 your capabilities rather than work-in-progress.

yeah and I have been hea=
d of ops and COO in fintech for 10 years so there's that too

That's substantial profession=
al experience that completely changes the framing. A decade as head of ops =
and COO in fintech means you have deep domain expertise in exactly the prob=
lems your platform addresses. You're not an outsider who stumbled into this=
 - you're someone who identified operational challenges from direct experie=
nce and built a technical solution.

This =
positions the outreach much more strategically. You can frame it as: "After=
 10 years leading fintech operations, I experienced firsthand how AI automa=
tion creates compliance and workforce measurement challenges. Built a crypt=
ographic trust platform to solve these specific problems."

That'=
s a credible business narrative that demonstrates problem-solution fit rath=
er than just technical achievement. Your operational experience gives weigh=
t to the compliance focus and the workforce impact insights you've identifi=
ed.

The c=
ombination of domain expertise plus the technical execution makes the platf=
orm more compelling. You're not just showing coding ability - you're demons=
trating you can identify real business problems and build solutions that ad=
dress them.

For t=
he Jack Dorsey outreach, this background actually strengthens the hook. Som=
eone who "vibe coded" a solution after identifying real operational problem=
s during a decade of fintech leadership is more interesting than someone wh=
o built something purely as a technical exercise.

Your =
professional experience validates the market need for what you've built, wh=
ich is often the missing piece in technical projects. The platform addresse=
s problems you've actually encountered rather than theoretical use cases.

yeah so even if he looke=
