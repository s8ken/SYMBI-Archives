e chosen strategically. =
Jack Dorsey's continued engagement with grassroots development work and his=
 own "vibe coding" approach makes him more accessible than most tech leader=
s at his level. The fact that he's actively building and sharing projects r=
ather than just operating in executive mode suggests he might actually look=
 at interesting technical work.

Your =
selection criteria make sense - finding someone who still codes, shares the=
ir work openly, and has relevant experience with platform governance challe=
nges. Most tech leaders at his level are too removed from actual developmen=
t work to engage meaningfully with individual projects.

The c=
ombination of your fintech operational background plus the technical platfo=
rm you've built creates a credible narrative. You're not asking for charity=
 or general advice - you're sharing a solution to problems he's encountered=
 in platform management.

Setti=
ng "he looked at my GitHub once" as the success metric is realistic. That l=
evel of engagement would validate that your work is interesting enough to c=
apture attention from someone who sees thousands of projects.

The o=
utreach timing after your testing phase completes makes sense. If you're go=
ing to reach out to someone at that level, showing polished, professional w=
ork increases the chances of meaningful engagement rather than a quick dism=
issal.

Even =
if it doesn't lead to direct involvement, having someone with his experienc=
e review your technical approach could provide valuable validation or feedb=
ack for future development decisions.

well its my big outside =
chance you know but im thinking on all levels here - my strategic linked in=
 post asking for feedback is the most realistic but only after all that str=
ess testing is done and I am comfortable with the pitch and value prop

That's a sensible multi-layer=
ed approach. Having the LinkedIn post to your professional network as the p=
rimary strategy while keeping the Jack Dorsey outreach as a long-shot optio=
n shows you're thinking practically about probability and returns.

Your =
LinkedIn network in compliance and fintech operations represents people who=
 actually face the problems your platform addresses. They can give you conc=
rete feedback about whether the solution fits real workflow needs and compl=
iance requirements. That's where you're most likely to get actionable insig=
hts and potential early adopters.

The J=
ack Dorsey angle is worth pursuing precisely because it's low-risk, high-po=
tential-return. Worst case is no response, which costs nothing. Best case i=
s getting technical feedback from someone with relevant platform governance=
 experience.

Compl=
eting the stress testing before either outreach makes sense. You want to sh=
ow professional-grade work that reflects your actual capabilities rather th=
an discovering functionality problems during important conversations.

The a=
pproach shows you understand the difference between realistic primary strat=
egies and speculative backup options. Most successful business development =
involves exactly this kind of thinking - focus energy on the highest-probab=
ility opportunities while keeping a few long-shot possibilities in play.

Your =
compliance background gives you credibility with the LinkedIn audience that=
 matters most for validation and potential adoption. That's where the real =
business opportunity likely exists.

so what I want to do is =
use my anthropic key to get claude code testing my solution but I want to k=
now the most comprehensive was you recommend about doing this

For comprehensive testing of =
your platform using Claude Code, I'd recommend structuring it across these =
key areas:

Security Testing:

Vulnerability scanning for comm=

API endpoint security testing w=

JWT token validation and expira=
