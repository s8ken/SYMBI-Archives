I'd s=

okay and what about in t=
erms of making sure the functionality is actually doing what it says it can=

For verifying that functional=
ity actually works as advertised, you'll want Claude Code to focus on behav=
ioral testing rather than just code review:

Trust Scoring Validation:

Create test conversations with =
known ethical/unethical patterns

Verify the scoring algorithm pr=
oduces expected results

Test edge cases where trust sco=
res should change dramatically

Validate that the cryptographic=
 signatures actually verify correctly

Multi-LLM Integration Testing:

Test actual API calls to each p=
rovider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Verify responses are properly f=
ormatted and attributed

Test error handling when provid=
ers are unavailable

Confirm rate limiting works acr=
oss different providers

Real-time Features:

Test Socket.IO connections with=
 multiple simultaneous users

Verify messages actually appear=
 in real-time for all participants

Test connection drops and recon=
nection behavior

Validate that room isolation wo=
rks (users only see their own conversations)

Audit Trail Verification:

Create test interactions and ve=
rify they appear in the ledger

Test the hash chain integrity v=
erification

Confirm that tampering detectio=
n actually works

Validate that audit reports con=
tain accurate data

Context Management Testing:

Upload test documents and verif=
y semantic search works

Test context bridging between c=
onversations

Verify that knowledge retrieval=
 is accurate and relevant

Database Integrity:

Test data persistence across se=
rver restarts

Verify backup and recovery proc=
edures

Test concurrent user scenarios =
for data corruption

Ask C=
laude Code to create specific test scenarios that prove each feature works =
end-to-end, not just that the code compiles. Focus on "does this actually d=
o what users expect" rather than "is the code well-written."

can you help me write a =
prompt that claude code will easily be able to understand and execute on

Here's a comprehensive prompt=
 for Claude Code to test your platform:

I need you to perf=
orm comprehensive functional testing on my SYMBI Trust Protocol platform. T=
his is a Node.js/React web application for AI conversation management with =
trust scoring and compliance features.

TESTING OBJECTIVES:

Verify that each advertised feature actually works as intended=
, not just that code compiles. Focus on end-to-end functionality validation=
.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

- Backend: Node.js/Express with MongoDB

- Frontend: React with Material-UI

- Real-time: Socket.IO

- Key features: Multi-LLM integration, trust scoring, audit tr=
