TESTING AREAS TO COVER:

1. AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT

- Test user registration and login flows

- Verify JWT token generation and validation

- Test API key management for different LLM providers

- Validate session persistence and logout

2. CORE CONVERSATION FUNCTIONALITY

- Create conversations and verify they persist in database

- Test message sending/receiving through the API

- Verify real-time Socket.IO messaging works between users

- Test conversation history retrieval and display

3. TRUST SCORING SYSTEM

- Create test conversations with varying ethical content

- Verify trust scores are calculated and stored correctly

- Test the cryptographic signature generation and verification

- Validate that audit trails are properly created

4. MULTI-LLM INTEGRATION

- Test API calls to each configured provider (if API keys avai=
lable)

- Verify error handling when providers are unavailable

- Test rate limiting across different providers

- Confirm response formatting and attribution

5. SECURITY FEATURES

- Test rate limiting enforcement

- Verify input sanitization prevents injection attacks

- Test CORS configuration

- Validate webhook signature verification

6. DATABASE INTEGRITY

- Test data persistence across operations

- Verify relationships between users, conversations, and trust=
 records

- Test concurrent user scenarios

TESTING APPROACH:

1. Start the application in test mode

2. Run automated tests for each functionality area

3. Create detailed reports of what works vs what fails

4. Provide specific error messages and logs for any failures

5. Suggest fixes for identified issues

Please execute this testing plan systematically and provide a =
comprehensive report of your findings.

This =
prompt gives Claude Code clear objectives, scope, and methodology while foc=
using on functional validation rather than just code review.
