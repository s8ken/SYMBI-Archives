ntegration code exists
  and follows proper
  patterns
  Recommendations:
  - Need real API keys for
  OpenAI, Anthropic,
  Together AI to fully test
  - Backend server
  connectivity issues need
  investigation for
  standalone tests

  =F0=9F=9A=A8 CRITICAL FINDINGS
  Issues Identified:
  1. LLM API Keys Missing:
  Need real API keys for
  full multi-LLM testing
  2. Server Connectivity:
  Some standalone
  integration tests fail
  due to server startup
  issues
  3. Environment=20
  Configuration: Some tests
   expect different port
  configurations
  Security Concerns:
  - =E2=9C=85 No major security
  vulnerabilities found
  - =E2=9C=85 Proper
  authentication and
  authorization implemented
  - =E2=9C=85 Input validation and
   rate limiting working
  - =E2=9C=85 CORS properly
  configured
  Performance:
  - =E2=9C=85 Database operations
  fast (average 10-30ms
  response time)
  - =E2=9C=85 API responses
  efficient (under 100ms
  for most operations)
  - =E2=9C=85 Memory usage stable
  during test execution

  =F0=9F=93=8B RECOMMENDATIONS
  Immediate Actions:
  1. Add Real API Keys to
  .env for complete LLM
  testing
  2. Fix Server S
