You said:

yes how do I test it

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

Now that your deployment is live, here’s how you can test it properly:

🔗 
1. Visit the Live URL

Go to your 
Vercel dashboard
 → Click on your project → You should see the 
deployment URL
 (something like 
https://symbi.vercel.app/
).

Open it in your browser to ensure everything 
loads correctly
.

🛠 
2. Check Console for Errors (Frontend)

Open your site in 
Chrome
.

Right-click → Inspect → Go to 
Console
.

Look for 
red errors
 (JavaScript issues) or 
yellow warnings
 (potential optimizations).

🌍 
3. Verify API Calls (Backend)

If your project makes API calls, open the 
Network tab
 in DevTools.

Reload the page and check if any 
requests fail
 (look for 
404
, 
500
, or slow responses).

If any API calls fail, check the 
backend logs
 in Vercel.

📱 
4. Test on Mobile & Different Browsers

Open your site on:

Chrome

Safari

Firefox

Edge

Also, test it on 
mobile devices
 (or use Chrome DevTools to emulate mobile screens).

⚡ 
5. Run Lighthouse Performance Test

In Chrome, go to 
DevTools
 → Click on the 
Lighthouse
 tab.

Run a performance test to see how fast your site loads.

🔍 
6. Check Vercel Logs for Backend Issues

Go to 
Vercel Dashboard
 → Your project → Click 
"Logs"
.

Look for errors related to 
server functions
, 
database connections
, or 
API failures
.

📝 
7. Functional Testing

Click through your site’s 
pages, buttons, forms, and dynamic content
.

If you have user authentication,
