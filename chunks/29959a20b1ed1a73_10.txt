Your changes have been successfully pushed to GitHub!
 🚀

Now, let’s 
redeploy to Vercel
 to get the site live with the fixed dependencies.

🛠 Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

This will trigger a 
fresh deployment
 with your updated code.

🌍 Step 2: Check Your Live Website

Once the deployment completes, 
Vercel will provide a URL
 (e.g., 
https://symbi.vercel.app
).

Open that link and 
verify if everything is working
.

⚠️ Optional: Fix GitHub Vulnerability Warning

GitHub mentioned 
1 moderate vulnerability
. If you want to fix it:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm audit fix --force

Then, commit the changes again:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed GitHub dependency vulnerability"

git push origin main

And 
redeploy to Vercel
.

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Run 
vercel --prod

2️⃣ 
Check if the site works

3️⃣ 
Let me know if any errors appear

You're so close—let's finish this! 🔥💻🚀
