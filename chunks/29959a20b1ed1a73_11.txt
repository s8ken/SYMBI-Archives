 Your Vercel Deployment Completed Successfully!
 🎉

Now, let's do a 
final check
 to confirm that everything is working:

✅ Step 1: Visit Your Live Website

Check the 
Vercel production URL
 that was generated in the deployment logs.

It should be something like:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//symbi.vercel.app

Try opening it in your browser!
 🌍

🔍 Step 2: Verify Everything is Working

Does the homepage load?

No more 404 errors?

Does navigation work?

If your site uses API routes, check if they are responding.

⚠️ Step 3: If There’s an Issue

If the website 
still shows an error
:

1️⃣ 
Try a Hard Refresh
 (to clear cache)

Windows/Linux:

CTRL + Shift + R

Mac:

CMD + Shift + R

2️⃣ 
Check Vercel Logs for Runtime Errors

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi.vercel.app

This will show if there are any issues running the app.

3️⃣ 
If you see any errors, copy them here
, and I'll debug them for you! 🔥

🚀 Final Thoughts

If the site works fine, 
you’ve successfully deployed!
 🎉 🎯

If anything is broken, let me know, and I'll help you fix it ASAP! 💻⚡

Alright, since deployment completed successfully but you're 
still getting a 404
, it likely means one of the following issues:

🔍 Possible Causes & Fixes for the 404

1️⃣ Next.js App Router Requires 
page.tsx
 at Root

Since you're using the 
App Router
 (from Next.js 13+), your 
home page must be in:

bash

Copy

Edit

app/page.tsx

🔹 
Fix:
 Make sure this file exists and contains a simple component:

tsx

Copy

Edit

export

default

function

Home

(

) {

return

 (

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black text-white"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-3xl font-bold"

>Welcome to Symbi AI!

</
h1

>

</
main

>

</
div

>
  );
}

Then, commit & redeploy:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed missing homepage"

git push origin main
vercel --prod

2️⃣ Check 
next.config.mjs
 or 
next.config.js

If you recently updated dependencies, your 

next.config.mjs

 may be missing the correct output settings.

🔹 
Fix:
 Open 
next.config.mjs
 (or 
next.config.js
) and make sure it has:

js

Copy

Edit

export

default

 {

output

: 

"export"

, 

// Or "standalone" if using SSR

trailingSlash

: 

true

,
};

Then redeploy!

3️⃣ Vercel Routes Might Be Misconfigured

Your 
Vercel project settings
 might be pointing to the wrong build output.

🔹 
Fix:

Open 
Vercel Dashboard
 → Go to your 
Symbi project
.

Check 
Build & Output Settings
:

Build Command:

npm run build

Output Directory:
 Should be 
/.next
 (for Next.js).

If wrong, update settings, 
redeploy
, and test again.

4️⃣ Force a Clean Deployment

Sometimes Vercel caches old builds, so 
force a fresh deploy
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --force --prod

🚀 Final Steps

1️⃣ 
Make sure 
app/page.tsx
 exists.

2️⃣ 
Check 
next.config.mjs
 settings.

3️⃣ 
Verify Vercel output settings.

4️⃣ 
Run 
vercel --force --prod
 to force a new build.

Let me know what happens! 🚀🔥

🚨 
Your 
page.tsx
 file is missing!
 That’s why Vercel is showing a 
404 error
.

🛠 Fix: Create 
app/page.tsx

Since 
app/page.tsx
 doesn’t exist, you need to 
create it manually
. Follow these steps:

1️⃣ Navigate to the 
app/
 Directory

You're already inside 
app/
, so just 
create the file
:

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 page.tsx

2️⃣ Open 
page.tsx
 and Add Code

Now, open the file in a text editor:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano page.tsx

Paste this inside:

tsx

Copy

Edit

export

default

function

Home

(

) {

return

 (

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-bl
