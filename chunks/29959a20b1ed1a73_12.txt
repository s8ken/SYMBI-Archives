hang on tho I already have the code for the look and feel of the site

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

Got it! You already have the code for your site's 
look and feel
, so we just need to 
ensure 
app/page.tsx
 exists
 and contains your existing code. Let's keep all your styling and layout intact. 🚀

🛠 Step 1: Check If 
app/page.tsx
 Exists

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

If 
page.tsx

is listed
, then it exists.

If 
not
, you need to create it.

If missing, create it with:

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 page.tsx

🛠 Step 2: Open 
page.tsx
 & Add Your Existing Code

Since you 
already have your site’s design
, open the file:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano page.tsx

Now, 
paste your existing code
 inside.

For example, if your design looked like this:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

export

default

function

Home

(

) {

return

 (

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black text-white"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"container max-w-4xl px-4 py-16 md:py-24 text-center"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-3xl font-bold"

>Welcome to Symbi AI

</
h1

>

<
div

className

=

"relative w-40 h-40 md:w-40 md:h-40 mt-8"

>

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"SYMBI Logo"

width

=

{160}

height

=

{160}

className

=

"rounded-lg object-cover"

priority

            />

</
div

>

</
div

>

</
main

>

</
div

>
  );
}

Paste 
your actual code
 instead, keeping the styling and layout you already have.

🔹 
Save the file in Nano:

Press 
CTRL + X

 to exit.

Press 
Y

 to confirm.

Press 
ENTER

 to save.

🛠 Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

Once 
page.tsx
 is correct, commit and push:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ..
git add .
git commit -m 

"Ensured homepage exists with correct design"

git push origin main

🚀 Step 4: Redeploy to Vercel

Now deploy with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

🔥 Final Check

Once deployment completes, open your Vercel URL and confirm:

✅ 
No more 404 errors

✅ 
Your design & layout appear correctly

Try this and let me know if it works! 🚀🔥

I need to start again using my local drive as I can't wait on proton drive to sync

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

Got it! 
Starting fresh on your local drive
 will speed things up. Let’s go step by step to 
move your project
 and get it deployed ASAP. 🚀

🛠 Step 1: Copy the Project to Your Local Drive

Since 
Proton Drive is slow
, let’s move everything to a local folder.

1️⃣ 
Navigate to a local directory (e.g., 
Documents/Projects/
)

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents

mkdir

 symbi-ai-website

cd

 symbi-ai-website

2️⃣ 
Copy files from Proton Drive to this new location

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 -R 

"/Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website/."

 .

✅ This 
copies everything
 from Proton Drive to your local machine.

🛠 Step 2: Verify Everything is in Place

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la

Make sure your project files exist:

arduino

Copy

Edit

symbi-ai-website/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx  ✅ (Make sure 

this

 file exists!)
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── globals.css
