✅ 
Git Commit & Push Successful!
 🎉

Now that your code is 
safely pushed to GitHub
, let's 
deploy it to Vercel
! 🚀

🛠 Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

🔹 The 
--force
 flag ensures that 
Vercel does a fresh deployment
 and doesn't use cached builds.

🌍 Step 2: Check Your Live Website

1️⃣ 
Wait for the deployment to complete
 (should take a minute or less).

2️⃣ 
Vercel will give you a URL (e.g., 
https://symbi.vercel.app
)
.

3️⃣ 
Open the URL in your browser and verify:

✅ 
Homepage loads (no 404 errors)

✅ 
Images and styles are correct

✅ 
No console errors in DevTools

🚀 If Deployment Fails Again

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi.vercel.app

If there’s an error
, send me the logs, and I’ll debug it for you!

🔥 
You’re almost there! Try 
vercel --prod --force
 and let me know how it goes!
 🚀🔥
