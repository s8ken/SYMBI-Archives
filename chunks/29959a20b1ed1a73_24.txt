🚨 
Issue: Vercel Can't Find the Deployment
 🚨

This happens when the project is deployed under a different URL than 

symbi.vercel.app

. Let's find the 
correct deployment URL and check the logs properly.
 🚀

🛠 Step 1: Find the Correct Deployment URL

Since your deployment 
completed successfully
, your site was likely deployed under a different auto-generated URL.

1️⃣ 
Check your last Vercel deployment log output

Look for a URL that looks like:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//symbi-6fyfo6rib-symbi.vercel.app

Copy 
that URL
 and test it in your browser.

2️⃣ 
If you don’t remember the URL
, list your deployments:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel 

ls

This will show all past deployments.

Look for the 
most recent one
 and use that URL.

🛠 Step 2: Get Logs for the Correct Deployment

Once you have the 
correct deployment URL
, check the logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

For example:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi-6fyfo6rib-symbi.vercel.app

🚀 Step 3: Check If Your Website is Live

1️⃣ 
Go to your Vercel dashboard:

➡️ 
Vercel Projects

2️⃣ 
Click on your "Symbi" project

3️⃣ 
Find the latest deployment & test the URL

✅ Next Steps

If your site 
works
, you’re all set! 🎉

If you still see a 
404
, let me know what URL you’re using & what logs say. 🔥

🚀 
Try these now and let me know what you find!
