)
.

This allows 
instant responses
 instead of waiting for API requests.

Option 2: API-Based Chat (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)

If Symbi uses 
AI responses
, we can connect to 
OpenAI API, Claude, or Gemini
.

Example 
Next.js API Route
 for chat:

tsx

Copy

Edit

export

default

async

function

handler

(

req, res

) {

const

 { message } = req.

body

;

const

 response = 

await

fetch

(

"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions"

, {

method

: 

"POST"

,

headers

: {

"Content-Type"

: 

"application/json"

,

"Authorization"

: 

`Bearer 
${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}

`
    },

body

: 

JSON

.

stringify

({

model

: 

"gpt-4"

,

messages

: [{ 

role

: 

"user"

, 

content

: message }]
    })
  });

const

 data = 

await

 response.

json

();
  res.

status

(

200

).

json

({ 

reply

: data.

choices

[

0

].

message

.

content

 });
}

🔹 
This lets Symbi respond using an AI model.

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Decide where to build (v0.dev or local development).

If real-time chat is required → move to local development.

If basic UI updates are enough → stay on v0.dev for now.

2️⃣ 
Set up the "Manage" page.

Create 
app/manage/page.tsx
 (if using Next.js).

Add a 
basic chat UI placeholder
.

3️⃣ 
Integrate Symbi Chat.

Will it use 
real-time WebSockets
 or a 
REST API?

don't worry about the chat so much I just need to know which model we are using and figure out why I didn't work... so the v0.dev one just deployed does it also have a project in vercel?

🚀 Understanding v0.dev & Vercel Deployment

Yes, when you deploy from 
v0.dev
, it still 
creates a project in Vercel
. However, the setup might be 
slightly different from a manual GitHub/Vercel CLI deployment
.

🛠 Step 1: Check if v0.dev Created a Project in Vercel

To confirm whether v0.dev created a separate project in Vercel, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel 

ls

This will list 
all projects linked to your Vercel account
.

Look for something like:

Copy

Edit

v0-symbi-ai-website-7xvcqm

🔹 If it appears, then 
v0.dev created its own deployment in Vercel
.

Alternatively, go to 

Vercel Dashboard

 and check your projects manually.

🛠 Step 2: Compare v0.dev vs. Your CLI Deployed Project

If 
v0.dev deployed successfully
, but your CLI deployment didn’t, there might be differences in:

1️⃣ Project Settings

Open 
Vercel Dashboard
 → Select your 
v0.dev deployment project

Compare it with your manually deployed project

Check settings like:

Environment Variables

Build Command (Is v0.dev using a different one?)

Output Directory

2️⃣ Framework Preset

v0.dev might have 
automatically set a Next.js preset
 in Vercel.

In 
Vercel Dashboard → Settings → General
, see if your manually deployed project is 
using the same preset
 as the v0.dev deployment.

3️⃣ Differences in 
next.config.mjs

Open 
next.config.mjs
 in 
both
 deployments.

Does v0.dev have extra settings?

If missing, add them to your local version and redeploy.

🛠 Step 3: Fix Your CLI Deployment

If your manual deployment still 
doesn’t work
, try:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

If the issue persists, compare
:

Logs from v0.dev deployment
 vs. 
Logs from CLI deployment

Use:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel inspect --logs <deployment-url>

to check each one.

✅ Next Steps

1️⃣ Run 
vercel ls
 to confirm 
where v0.dev deployed
.

2️⃣ Check 
Vercel dashboard
 → Compare project settings.

3️⃣ Look at 
build logs
 for differences.

4️⃣ If needed, 
apply the same configs from v0.dev to your local project
.
