 Detected" error.

2️⃣ 
Check the live site and confirm the 404 is gone.

3️⃣ 
If the 404 persists, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

and send me the results.

🔥 
Try this now and let me know how it goes!
 🚀

✅ 
You've created the 
vercel.json
 file!
 Now let's edit it to 
explicitly tell Vercel that this is a Next.js project.

🛠 Step 1: Edit 
vercel.json

Run this command to open the file in Nano:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano vercel.json

Then 
paste this inside
:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"version"

:

2

,

"builds"

:

[

{

"src"

:

"package.json"

,

"use"

:

"@vercel/next"

}

]

,

"routes"

:

[

{

"src"

:

"/(.*)"

,

"dest"

:

"/"

}

]

}

✅ 
This explicitly tells Vercel that the project is a Next.js app.

🛠 Step 2: Save & Exit Nano

After pasting the content:

Press 
CTRL + X

 to exit.

Press 
Y

 to save changes.

Press 
ENTER

 to confirm.

🛠 Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

Now, commit the change and push it to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add vercel.json
git commit -m 

"Added vercel.json to define Next.js project"

git push origin main

🚀 This ensures that 
Vercel will now detect the framework correctly.

🛠 Step 4: Redeploy to Vercel

Now, deploy with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

✅ 
This will trigger a new deployment where Vercel correctly identifies the project as Next.js.

✅ Final Confirmation

Check your Vercel dashboard
 to confirm that the framework is now 
detected as Next.js
.

Test your live site
 to ensure there are 
no more 404 errors
.

If the error persists, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

and let me know what it says.

🚀 
Try this now and let me know if it works!

okay so that worked for the first time! however we lost the whole look and feel of the site

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

🚀 
Great! The site is finally deploying correctly!
 🎉

Now, let’s 
fix the lost styling and look & feel
 while keeping everything working on Vercel.

🛠 Step 1: Check if Global Styles are Being Loaded

Since the site structure is working but the design is missing, the most likely issue is that 
global styles (CSS/Tailwind) are not loading correctly
.

1️⃣ Check if 
globals.css
 is Imported

Open 

app/layout.tsx

 and ensure it contains this import:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

"../globals.css"

;

If it's missing, 
add it
, then save.

🛠 Step 2: Check if Tailwind is Configured Correctly

If you're using 
Tailwind CSS
, ensure 

tailwind.config.ts

 includes the correct paths.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 tailwind.config.ts

It should look something like this:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

type

 { 

Config

 } 

from

"tailwindcss"

;

const

config

: 

Config

 = {

content

: [

"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

,

"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

  ],

theme

: {

extend

: {},
  },

plugins

: [],
};

export

default

 config;

🔹 If the 
content
 paths 
are missing or incorrect
, fix them and 
save
.

🛠 Step 3: Ensure 
postcss.config.mjs
 is Present

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 | grep postcss.config.mjs

If it's missing, create it:

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 postcss.config.mjs

Then add:

js

Copy

Edit

export

default

 {

plugins

: {

tailwindcss

: {},

autoprefixer

: {},
  },
};

✅ This ensures 
Tailwind and CSS are processed correctly
.

🛠 Step 4: Commit & Redeploy

Now, commit these fixes:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed styling issues (globals.css, Tailwind, PostCSS)"

git push origin main

Then redeploy:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

🚀 Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Does the site now have its styles back?
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Does it load correctly on Vercel?
 ✅

3️⃣ 
If styles are still missing, check the browser console (
F12
 → Console) for errors
 and send me the results.

🔥 
Try these fixes and let me know if the site looks correct again!
