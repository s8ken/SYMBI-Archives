*)"

,

"dest"

:

"/"

}

]

}

✅ 
This ensures Vercel detects Next.js correctly.

2️⃣ Update 
next.config.mjs

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano next.config.mjs

Ensure it includes:

js

Copy

Edit

export

default

 {

output

: 

"export"

,

trailingSlash

: 

true

,
};

✅ 
This fixes static exports and routing issues.

3️⃣ Switch to 
bun
 for Compatibility

Since v0.dev originally used 
bun
, we’ll ensure it’s used properly.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install -g bun
bun install

✅ 
This installs dependencies the same way v0.dev did.

🛠 Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

Now, let’s push the 
restored and fixed
 project to GitHub.

1️⃣ 
Initialize Git (If Needed)

bash

Copy

Edit

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
git branch -M main
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

2️⃣ 
Commit the Changes

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Restored v0.dev project and applied Vercel fixes"

git push origin main

🚀 
Your latest fixed version is now in GitHub.

🛠 Step 4: Redeploy to Vercel

Now, let’s deploy:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

✅ 
This deploys the restored v0.dev project with fixes.

✅ Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Check if your site’s design is fully restored

2️⃣ 
Confirm that Vercel detects Next.js properly

3️⃣ 
If any errors appear, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

4️⃣ 
If it still fails, we’ll compare Vercel settings with v0.dev’s version.

🔥 
Try these steps and let me know if it works!

You said:

do we need to switch or do you think it was being explicit that changed it - I notice that it still didn't have anything under framework

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

Great observation! Since 
Vercel still didn’t detect a framework under "Framework Preset"
, it means the 
explicit 
vercel.json
 file
 and 
properly configuring 
next.config.mjs

 were the key changes that fixed the deployment. 
We don’t necessarily need to switch to 
bun
 if it was just a detection issue.

🛠 Conclusion: What We Actually Need to Fix

Now that we know the cause, the plan is:

✅ 
Restore the original v0.dev project

✅ 
Ensure 
vercel.json
 explicitly defines Next.js

✅ 
Ensure 
next.config.mjs
 includes 
output: "export"

✅ 
Push everything to GitHub and redeploy

🛠 Final Steps

1️⃣ Restore the v0.dev Project

Extract your original v0.dev project

Replace your current local folder with the extracted version

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website

mv

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website

Check that all v0.dev files are back

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -R

2️⃣ Add the 
vercel.json
 File (Explicit Framework Definition)

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 vercel.json

Paste this inside:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"version"

:

2

,

"builds"

:

[

{

"src"

:

"package.json"

,

"use"

:

"@vercel/next"

}

]

,

"routes"

:

[

{

"src"

:

"/(.*)"

,

"dest"

:

"/"

}

]

}

✅ 
This tells Vercel that it should treat the project as Next.js.

3️⃣ Fix 
next.config.mjs
 (Ensure Static Export)

bash

Copy

Edit

nano next.config.mjs

Make sure it contains:

js

Copy

Edit

export

default

 {

output

: 

"export"

,

trailingSlash

: 

true

,
};

✅ 
This ensures Next.js builds a static version of the site.

4️⃣ Commit & Push to GitHub

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Restored v0.dev project with explicit Vercel configuration"

git push origin main

5️⃣ Redeploy to Vercel

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

✅ 
This will now deploy the original v0.dev project but with explicit fixes for Vercel.

✅ Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Check if the site is restored with full styling and functionality

2️⃣ 
Verify in Vercel Dashboard that the deployment was successful

3️⃣ 
Confirm that "Framework Preset" in Vercel Settings is still empty, meaning we controlled the detection explicitly

4️⃣ 
If the site still breaks, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <
