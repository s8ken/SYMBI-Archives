✅ 
Success! Your GitHub repository is fully updated!
 🚀

Now, let’s 
redeploy to Vercel
 to confirm everything is working. Since 
vercel.json
 was deleted, we’ll see if it was actually necessary.

🛠 Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

This will:

✅ Deploy the 
working v0.dev setup

✅ Ensure 
Vercel detects Next.js correctly

✅ Fix the 
404 issue permanently

🛠 Step 2: Check the Vercel Deployment

Once the deployment finishes:

1️⃣ Open the 
Vercel deployment URL

2️⃣ 
Check if everything looks correct
 (styles, components, UI)

3️⃣ 
Go to the Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Framework Preset

It should 
now say "Next.js"

4️⃣ 
If Vercel still doesn’t detect Next.js
, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

✅ Final Confirmation

🔍 
Is the website fully working on Vercel?

❌ 
Any missing styles or components?

📜 
Did Vercel automatically detect Next.js?

🔥 
Try this now and let me know the results!

🚨 
Issue: The Deployment Worked, But Styling & UI Were Lost Again

Now that we 
confirmed Vercel deployment is stable
, we need to 
restore the v0.dev styling & components without breaking the deployment
.

🔍 Why Did We Lose Styling?

1️⃣ 
Files Were Overwritten or Deleted During Git Push

vercel.json
 was deleted (not a problem)

public/Symbi Logo.jpg
 was removed

bun.lock
 was removed

2️⃣ 
Some v0.dev-Specific Files May Not Have Been Committed

app/globals.css

app/page.tsx

tailwind.config.ts

components/ui/
 folder

🛠 Step 1: Restore the v0.dev Styles & Components

Since the design worked 
before we pushed to GitHub
, we need to 
recover the v0.dev files
 and re-add them.

1️⃣ Restore the Missing Files

If you still have the 
original v0.dev ZIP
, extract and 
copy back missing files
:

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/styles ./styles

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/components ./components

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/public/Symbi\ Logo.jpg ./public/

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/tailwind.config.ts ./

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/globals.css ./app/

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/page.tsx ./app/

(Adjust paths based on where the ZIP is stored.)

2️⃣ Check If 
layout.tsx
 Has the Correct Imports

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano app/layout.tsx

Ensure it includes:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

"../styles/globals.css"

;

import

"../styles/tailwind.css"

; 

// If v0.dev had custom Tailwind

✅ 
This makes sure the styles load properly.

🛠 Step 2: Recommit & Redeploy
