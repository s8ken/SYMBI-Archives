so how can it tell it to overwrite those other files this time?

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

To force 
shadcn
 to 
overwrite the skipped files
, you need to explicitly add the 
--overwrite
 flag.

🛠 Step 1: Run the Command Again with 
--overwrite

bash

Copy

Edit

npx shadcn@latest add 

"https://v0.dev/chat/b/b_DYNJxfebOq7"

 --overwrite

✅ 
This ensures that all previously skipped files (
layout.tsx
, 
globals.css
, 
tailwind.config.ts
, etc.) are replaced with v0.dev’s original versions.

🛠 Step 2: Verify That the Files Were Overwritten

After running the command, check if the files have been modified:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

If the files 
appear as modified
, they were successfully overwritten.

🛠 Step 3: Commit & Push the Changes

Once the files are restored, commit and push them to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Overwrote v0.dev files to restore styling and UI"

git push origin main

✅ 
This ensures the correct v0.dev version is now in GitHub.

🛠 Step 4: Redeploy to Vercel

Now, redeploy the updated project:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

🚀 
This will deploy the fully restored v0.dev version with the correct styling.

✅ Final Check

1️⃣ 
Does the site now look exactly as it did in v0.dev?

2️⃣ 
Did all overwritten files properly restore UI components?

3️⃣ 
Check Vercel logs if anything is still broken:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

🔥 
Try these steps and let me know if it works!

, 
app/globals.css
, 
tailwind.config.ts
