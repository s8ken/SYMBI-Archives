🚨 Issue: Files Still Skipped Despite Using 
--overwrite

Since 
shadcn
 is still 
skipping 5 files
, even with 
--overwrite
, we need to 
force a complete replacement
.

🛠 Solution: Manually Overwrite the Files

Since 
shadcn
 isn’t replacing them, we’ll 
manually copy the v0.dev files
 and ensure they are used.

1️⃣ Restore Files Manually

If you still have the 
original v0.dev ZIP file
, extract and manually 
copy back missing files
:

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/layout.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/components/theme-provider.tsx ./components/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/globals.css ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/page.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/tailwind.config.ts ./

(Adjust paths based on where your v0.dev ZIP is stored.)

✅ 
This guarantees that we restore the correct versions of the files.

2️⃣ Verify the Files Are Restored

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

You should see the copied files 
listed as modified
.

If they 
do not show up
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -R app/ components/ styles/

If files 
are missing
, 
check that you copied them correctly
.

If files 
are present
, continue to commit and deploy.

🛠 Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Manually restored v0.dev files for full UI"

git push origin main

✅ 
Now GitHub has the complete v0.dev version.

🛠 Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

🚀 
Now, the full v0.dev styling and components should be deployed successfully.

✅ Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Does the site now have the correct styling?
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Did all v0.dev files get restored correctly?
 ✅

3️⃣ 
Does the Vercel deployment work?
 ✅
