🚀 
Running Locally First – Smart Move!

Since the local version 
previously looked correct
, let’s make sure it still works after the latest fixes.

🛠 Step 1: Start the Local Development Server

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

bun run dev

(If you’re using npm instead of Bun, run 
npm run dev
 instead.)

🛠 Step 2: Open the Local Site

Once the server is running, open:

➡️ 

http://localhost:3000

🔍 
Check for:

✅ Correct 
styling and layout

✅ 
Images and UI components
 loading properly

✅ No 
console errors
 in DevTools (
F12
 → Console)

🛠 Step 3: If the UI is Wrong, Check for Errors

If 
styles are missing or UI is incorrect
:

1️⃣ 
Check that 
globals.css
 is imported in 
layout.tsx

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

"../globals.css"

;

2️⃣ 
Check if Tailwind is configured properly

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 tailwind.config.ts

Ensure 
content
 includes:

ts

Copy

Edit

content

: [

"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

, 

"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

],

3️⃣ 
Restart the server after changes

bash

Copy

Edit

bun run dev

🛠 Step 4: If Everything Looks Good, Commit & Deploy

If the local version 
looks correct
, commit and push it:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Confirmed UI locally, ready for deployment"

git push origin main

Then deploy to Vercel:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

✅ Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Does the local site match what you expect?
 ✅

2️⃣ 
No missing styles or UI issues?
 ✅

3️⃣ 
If everything is good, push to GitHub and redeploy on Vercel.

🔥 
Check the local site and let me know if it looks correct!

🚨 
Issue: Lost Look & Feel + Logo Locally

Since everything 
worked earlier
 and is now broken 
both locally and on Vercel
, we need to 
compare the GitHub version
 to ensure nothing was lost.

🛠 Step 1: Check GitHub for Missing Files

1️⃣ Open Your GitHub Repository

Go to 

Your GitHub Repository

 and check:

app/layout.tsx

 (Ensure styles are imported)

app/globals.css

 (Ensure it exists)

tailwind.config.ts

 (Ensure Tailwind paths are correct)

public/symbi-logo.jpg

 (Ensure logo is still in 
public/
)

🛠 Step 2: Compare Local Files with GitHub

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

If files are missing, Git will show 
untracked files
.

If files were modified, Git will show 
changes
.

2️⃣ If Git Shows No Changes, Pull Latest Code

To ensure your local project matches GitHub, pull the latest version:

bash

Copy

Edit

git pull origin main --force

Then, restart the local server:

bash

Copy

Edit

bun run dev

✅ 
This ensures your local project is fully synced with GitHub.

🛠 Step 3: Restore Missing Styling

If 
globals.css
 is missing or not loading, check 
app/layout.tsx
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

"../globals.css"

;

import

"../styles/tailwind.css"

; 

// If Tailwind is being used

✅ 
If missing, add it back and restart the server.

🛠 Step 4: Check Tailwind Configuration

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 tailwind.config.ts

Ensure it contains:

ts

Copy

Edit

content

: [

"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

, 

"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

],

✅ 
If the paths are missing, add them and restart the server.

🛠 Step 5: If Logo is Missing

Check if 
symbi-logo.jpg
 is in 
public/
:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 public/

If missing, copy it back from your backup:

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 ~/Downloads/symbi-logo.jpg public/

Then, commit:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add public/symbi-logo.jpg
git commit -m 

"Restored missing logo"

git push origin main

✅ Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Does GitHub have the correct version?
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Did pulling from GitHub fix the local version?
 ✅

3️⃣ 
If files were missing, did restoring them fix the UI?
 ✅

🔥 
Try these steps and let me know what’s still missing!
