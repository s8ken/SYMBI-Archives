sing Environment Variables

If Codespaces has 
extra environment variables
, list them:

bash

Copy

Edit

printenv

 | grep NEXT_PUBLIC

If you see anything that is 
not set locally
, add it to 

.env.local

 on your machine.

🛠 Step 3: Sync Local Machine with Codespaces

If Codespaces works but your local version doesn’t:

bash

Copy

Edit

git pull origin main --force
bun install
bun run dev

✅ 
Now, your local machine should match Codespaces exactly!

🚀 Final Steps

1️⃣ 
Does the project work inside Codespaces?
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Did syncing missing files & dependencies fix local development?
 ✅

3️⃣ 
If everything is correct, commit & redeploy to Vercel
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Synced Codespaces and local setup"

git push origin main
vercel --prod --force

🔥 
Try these steps and let me know if everything is working!

🚀 Do You Need to Connect Your Local Terminal to GitHub Codespaces?

No, 
you don’t need to connect your local terminal to Codespaces
 unless you prefer to work locally. 
GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based terminal directly in your browser.

However, if you want to 
work inside Codespaces from your local terminal
, you 
can connect your local machine to Codespaces using SSH
.

🛠 Option 1: Using the Built-in Codespaces Terminal

1️⃣ 
Open GitHub Codespaces
 from your repository

2️⃣ Click 
"Terminal"
 → 
"New Terminal"

3️⃣ Run a simple command to check if it works:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

✅ If you see a list of files, your 
Codespaces terminal is working
.

🛠 Option 2: Connect Codespaces to Your Local Terminal (via SSH)

If you prefer to use your 
local terminal to work inside Codespaces
, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Get the Codespaces SSH Connection Command

1️⃣ Go to your 
GitHub repository

2️⃣ Click 
"Codespaces"
 → 
Find your active Codespace

3️⃣ Click 
"Connect"
 → 
Select "Connect via SSH"

4️⃣ Copy the SSH command (it will look like this):

bash

Copy

Edit

ssh -i ~/.ssh/codespaces-key user@codespaces-abcdef1234-567890.github.dev

2️⃣ Open Your Local Terminal and Connect

1️⃣ Open 
your local terminal (Mac/Linux Terminal, Windows PowerShell)

2️⃣ Paste the SSH command from step 1 and run it:

bash

Copy

Edit

ssh -i ~/.ssh/codespaces-key user@codespaces-abcdef1234-567890.github.dev

3️⃣ Now, you're 
inside the GitHub Codespaces environment from your local terminal!
 🎉

🛠 Step 3: Run Your Project Inside Codespaces

Once inside the Codespaces terminal (either via SSH or browser terminal), run:

bash

Copy
