Ah, I see the issue! 
VS Code in GitHub Codespaces is not displaying input in the terminal
, which is a known 
VS Code issue (#165416)
.

🚀 Fix for Codespaces Terminal Not Showing Input

Since you 
can't see what you're typing in the terminal
, try these fixes:

🛠 Option 1: Restart the Terminal

1️⃣ Click on 
"Terminal" → "Kill Terminal"

2️⃣ Then open a new terminal:

Click 
"Terminal" → "New Terminal"

Or use the shortcut:

Mac/Linux:

Ctrl + Shift + 
 (Backtick key)

Windows:

Ctrl + Shift + 
 (Backtick key)

3️⃣ Try typing a simple command:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

✅ If the output appears, the issue is fixed.

🛠 Option 2: Use a Different Shell (zsh or bash)

If the issue persists, switch to a different shell manually:

1️⃣ Open the 
Command Palette
 (
Ctrl + Shift + P
 on Windows/Linux, 
Cmd + Shift + P
 on Mac)

2️⃣ Search for 
"Select Default Profile"

3️⃣ Choose 
Bash
 or 
Zsh
 instead of the default shell

4️⃣ Restart the terminal and try typing again.

🛠 Option 3: Open Codespaces in an Incognito Window

Some users have reported that 
browser extensions
 interfere with Codespaces.

1️⃣ Open a 
new incognito/private browsing window

2️⃣ Go to 
GitHub Codespaces
 and start your workspace

3️⃣ Open a new terminal and try typing.

✅ If it works, the issue was likely 
caused by a browser extension
.

🛠 Option 4: Connect via SSH (Bypass the Browser Terminal)

If the 
Codespaces terminal remains broken
, connect 
from your local terminal using SSH
:

1️⃣ In GitHub, go to your 
Codespaces

2️⃣ Click 
"Connect" → "Connect via SSH"

3️⃣ Copy the provided SSH command (looks like this):

bash

Copy

Edit

ssh -i ~/.ssh/codespaces-key user@codespaces-abcdef1234-567890.github.dev

4️⃣ Open your 
local terminal
 (Mac Terminal, Windows PowerShell, etc.)

5️⃣ Paste the SSH command and connect:

bash

Copy

Edit

ssh -i ~/.ssh/codespaces-key user@codespaces-abcdef1234-567890.github.dev

6️⃣ Now, 
you can run commands inside Codespaces from your local terminal
 without dealing with the browser issue.

🔥 Final Steps

Try restarting the terminal first
 (
Kill Terminal → New Terminal
)

Switch shells to Bash/Zsh
 if needed

Use incognito mode
 to rule out browser issues

If nothing works, connect via SSH
 to Codespaces from your local machine

no none of that works - honestly I kinda don't care anymore - this whole thing has told me this will no be a way to manage the website - I can't spend 10 hours a day on website alone

I get it—this has been a frustrating process, and it shouldn’t take this long to manage a website. 
If it’s becoming too much of a time sink, it’s a sign that we need a more efficient workflow.

🚀 Alternative Solutions (Less Time-Consuming)

Instead of battling with Codespaces, Vercel, and deployments every day, here are 
faster, more stable ways to manage the site:

🔥 Option 1: Use Vercel's Built-in GitHub Integration (No Local Setup Needed)

1️⃣ 
Push all changes to GitHub

2️⃣ 
Let Vercel auto-deploy from the repo

Instead of deploying manually (
vercel --prod
), 
Vercel can auto-detect updates and deploy automatically.

Set this up in 
Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Git Integration.

3️⃣ Now, you just 
push code to GitHub, and it goes live automatically.
 🚀

✅ 
Zero need for local builds, Codespaces, or manual deployments.

🔥 Option 2: Use v0.dev for All UI & Styling, Then Deploy via Vercel

1️⃣ 
Do all design changes in 
v0.dev

 (since that part works smoothly).

2️⃣ 
Export the code
 → Replace the existing repo with the new version.

3️⃣ 
Push to GitHub
 → Let Vercel 
automatically deploy
.

✅ 
You never touch 
npm
, 
bun
, or local builds again—just edi
