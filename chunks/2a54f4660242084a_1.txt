Symbi
 and the goal is to give you (or your team) 
autonomy over your website
, likely meaning streamlined deployment, easy updates, and maybe even some CMS integration or developer experience improvements.

To pick up from where we left off, can you remind me which part we were working on last?

Was it one of these?

Deploying to Vercel (initial setup or CI/CD config)

Setting up a CMS (e.g., Sanity, Contentful, or headless WordPress)

Configuring preview deployments or custom domains

Simplifying developer workflows (e.g., with GitHub + Vercel + environment variables)

Adding role-based access for content editing

Integrating dynamic features with serverless functions or edge middleware

Let me know where to jump in, and I’ll help you push Symbi forward with full autonomy in mind.
