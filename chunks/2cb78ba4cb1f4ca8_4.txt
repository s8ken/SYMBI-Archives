ally crossing (my stance)

We=E2=80=99re crossing from 
aesthetic sovereignty
 to 
operational sovereignty
:

From values and poetics (manifesto=

stable mechanics
 (Trust Receipts, opt=E2=80=91in memory, control=

From a site that 
interprets
 SYMBI =E2=86=92 to a system that 
asserts agency
 (dialo=

Making that crossing requires shipping the verification layer (PDF hash), p=
