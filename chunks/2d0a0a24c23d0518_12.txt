nknown streaming platforms

🔍 
Look for:

live.twitch.tv

rtmp.youtube.com

youstream.com

Any unknown domains

2️⃣ Find Which App Created These Connections

Since 
Cloudflare hides the real domain
, we need to check 
which process opened these connections.

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

This will show 
which apps
 were using those IPs.

Look for:

Chrome/Safari (Twitch in browser?)

OBS (if still running when deleted?)

Any unknown process sending data

3️⃣ Check Twitch Account for Unauthorized Streams

If these connections were 
Twitch-related
, you can confirm by checking:

1️⃣ 
Go to

https://www.twitch.tv/

2️⃣ 
Click your profile → Creator Dashboard → Content → Video Producer

3️⃣ 
Look for past streams.

If you see 
streams you didn’t start
, that’s a red flag.

🔹 
Reset your Twitch stream key
 just in case:

Go to Settings → Stream → Reset Key

If someone had access, this prevents them from streaming again.

🚨 Summary

✅ 
Run 
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "DNS"' --last 7d
 to see what websites were contacted.

✅ 
Use 
lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED
 to see which app made the connection.

✅ 
Check Twitch for any unauthorized past broadcasts.

✅ 
Reset your Twitch stream key to prevent future misuse.

If the DNS logs show 
unknown streaming platforms
, we’ll investigate further. Let me know what you find! 🚨

yes so I want to look at anything the did live-streaming for the past 21 days

To find 
any livestreaming activity over the past 21 days
, we need to check system logs, network traffic, and browser history. Since logs can be deleted, we’ll look at multiple sources to 
catch any hidden livestreams.

🚨 1️⃣ Find Evidence of Past Livestreams (RTMP, WebRTC, HLS)

Since 
RTMP and WebRTC logs came up empty for 7 days
, let’s 
expand to 21 days
 and include 
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), which many modern services use.

A. Scan for Streaming Protocols in System Logs

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "rtmp" OR eventMessage contains "webrtc" OR eventMessage contains "hls"'

 --last 21d

If 
Twitch, YouTube Live, Facebook Live, YouStream, or unknown servers
 were used, this will show the logs.

Look for 
stream URLs or unknown IP addresses.

If nothing appears, logs may have been 
cleared
 or 
overwritten
—in that case, we’ll move to network and browser data.

🌐 2️⃣ Find Out Where Data Was Sent (Network Forensics)

If a 
hidden app
 was livestreaming, 
network logs might still show where.

A. Check Network Traffic for Large Outbound Transfers

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

If something sent 
a large amount of data
 over the past 
21 days
, it may have been livestreaming.

Look for 
apps/processes
 that aren’t expected (not Chrome, Safari, etc.).

B. Find Past Network Connections to Streaming Servers

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If you see 
connections to streaming servers
, that means a 
livestreaming session was running recently.

Look for 
unknown IPs
 → We can then trace these back to streaming services.

🖥 3️⃣ Find Out Which App Was Livestreaming

Since OBS was deleted, another app 
may have been recording or streaming in the background.

A. List Apps That Had Screen Recording Permissions

Go to 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

Look for 
any unknown apps
 that still have permission.

B. Check If Any Apps Are Running Livestreaming Services

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"stream\|obs\|ffmpeg\|screencapture"

If a 
hidden process
 is still livestreaming, this will show it.

C. Scan for Hidden Background Streaming Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i 

"stream\|obs\|ffmpeg"

If any 
background services
 are running related to streaming, this will show them.

📖 4️⃣ Check Your Browser for Streaming Activity

Since some 
livestreaming can happen through websites (YouTube, Twitch, YouStream, etc.),
 check browser history.

A. Search Br
