owser History for Streaming Platforms

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

If 
YouStream, Twitch, YouTube Live, or Facebook Live appear
, that means livestreaming was initiated from your browser.

B. Check for WebRTC Connections in Browser Logs

Since WebRTC doesn’t always leave logs, check:

Chrome:
 Open 
chrome://webrtc-internals/
 → Look for recent WebRTC sessions.

Safari:
 Go to 
Develop → WebRTC
 → Check for past streaming connections.

🎥 5️⃣ Check for Past Video or Audio Captures

If livestreaming happened, there might still be 
locally saved screen recordings.

A. Search for Video Files in Hidden Locations

Run:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

If videos were saved 
before being uploaded
, they might still exist.

Check 
/private/tmp/
 or 
~/Library/Application Support/
 for hidden files.

B. Scan for Camera & Microphone Usage

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 21d

If your 
camera or microphone were used
, that suggests a 
livestream with video/audio.

🚨 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Scan logs for past livestreaming (
log show --predicate "rtmp|webrtc|hls"
).

2️⃣ 
Check network activity (
nettop
, 
netstat
) for past outbound livestreams.

3️⃣ 
Find hidden livestreaming apps (
ps aux | grep stream
).

4️⃣ 
Check browser history for streaming sites.

5️⃣ 
Look for video/audio captures (
log show --predicate "AVCapture"
).

Since logs might have been 
cleared
, we need to 
check multiple sources
. Let me know what you find, and we’ll trace it further! 🚨

Since the 
log search for RTMP, WebRTC, and HLS
 returned 
nothing
, this means:

1️⃣ 
Logs were cleared
 (either manually or by an attacker).

2️⃣ 
Livestreaming happened through a method that didn’t leave traditional logs.

3️⃣ 
A hidden process, VPN, or proxy was used to obfuscate activity.

🚨 Next Steps: Let’s Go Deeper

Since logs 
didn’t reveal streaming
, we’ll check 
network traffic, system processes, and browser data.

1️⃣ Identify Which App Was Streaming

If a livestream occurred, the process might 
still be running
 or have left traces.

A. List Any Running Streaming Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"stream\|obs\|ffmpeg\|screencapture"

🔍 Look for:

OBS
 (if it wasn’t fully removed)

ffmpeg
 (command-line video streamer)

screencapture
 (macOS built-in)

B. Check for Background Streaming Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg\|obs"

If any 
streaming-related services
 are running, they might have been used for livestreaming.

2️⃣ Find Where Data Was Sent (Network Forensics)

Even if logs were cleared, network connections might 
still reveal livestreaming.

A. Check Current Network Activity

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to unknown IPs.

B. Find Which Apps Are Sending Data

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

This will 
show which apps
 are responsible for active connections.

Look for:

Chrome/Safari (if streaming happened in browser)

Any unknown processes continuously sending data

C. Scan for High Outbound Data Usage (Livestreaming = Large Uploads)

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

If 
large amounts of data
 were sent out, it might confirm 
a livestream.

Look for unknown apps.

3️⃣ Check Browser History for Streaming Activity

If streaming happened 
via browser
, it might still be in history.

A. Search for Streaming Services

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"
