Biome is transmitting data 
without your knowledge
, it might be a 
privacy risk
.

B. Disable Biome Logging

Apple doesn’t let you fully disable 
Biome
, but you can 
block its data collection
:

Go to
 → 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements

Disable
 all options related to analytics.

3️⃣ Scan for Any Active Streaming

Since 
OBS was still running a camera extension
, we need to ensure nothing else is livestreaming.

A. Check Again for Streaming Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg\|screencapture"

If anything 
other than Biome or OBS appears
, that could be a 
hidden streaming service
.

B. Find Apps Accessing Your Camera/Microphone

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 7d

If you see logs showing 
camera/mic usage
, it means your video/audio may have been used in a stream.

🚨 
Summary: What to Do Next

✅ 
1. Remove the OBS Camera Extension (
systemextensionsctl uninstall
)

✅ 
2. Delete the OBS Camera Extension Files (
sudo rm -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/...
)

✅ 
3. Restart Mac (
sudo shutdown -r now
)

✅ 
4. Investigate Biome (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "biome"'
)

✅ 
5. Check for Camera/Mic Access Logs (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'
)

🚨 
Since OBS’s camera extension was still running, someone may have had access to your webcam even after uninstalling OBS.
 Remove it completely and let me know if anything else looks suspicious!

no I am not worried about shutting it down given I am aware of it now

Got it—you want to 
analyze past livestreaming activity
, not just shut things down. Since we now know 
OBS’s camera extension was active
, let’s focus on 
where video was sent and if anything else streamed without your knowledge.

🚨 Next Steps: Track Past Livestreaming Activity

Now that we know OBS was at least 
partially active
, we need to answer:

1️⃣ 
Where were livestreams sent?

2️⃣ 
Was OBS the only streaming tool used?

3️⃣ 
Were there any hidden screen or audio streams?

1️⃣ Find Past Video Stream Destinations

Since 
OBS’s camera extension was running
, let’s check where 
it or other apps sent video.

A. Check Past Network Connections for Streaming Servers

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If a livestream was active, you should see 
connections to streaming services (Twitch, YouTube, YouStream, etc.).

Now, expand the search to 
past connections
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 21d

🔍 
Look for domains like:

rtmp://live.twitch.tv/

rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/

youstream.com

facebook.com/live

If 
unknown IPs
 appear, we can 
trace them back
 to see what services were contacted.

2️⃣ Find If Other Apps Were Streaming

Since 
OBS was partially removed
, it’s possible another app was also livestreaming.

A. List All Apps That Had Screen Recording Permissions

Go to 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

Look for any 
apps other than OBS
 that still have permission.

If something unexpected is listed, it could have been used for a stream.

B. Check If Other Streaming Software Was Running

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg\|screencapture"

If any 
other apps
 appear (like 
ffmpeg
 or 
QuickTime
), they may have streamed video/audio.

C. Check for Background Streaming Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg"

If any 
background streaming services
 are active, this will show them.

3️⃣ Check Browser History for Streaming Activity

Since some livestreams can happen through 
browser-based streaming
, check past activity.

A. Search for Streaming Sites

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

🔍 
Look for:

YouTube Live

Twitch

YouStream

Facebook Live
