B. Check WebRTC Logs (If Browser Was Used for Streaming)

Chrome:
 Open 
chrome://webrtc-internals/

Safari:
 Go to 
Develop → WebRTC

If WebRTC sessions were used, that suggests 
livestreaming via browser
.

4️⃣ Find Past Camera/Microphone Usage

If a 
hidden livestream
 occurred, there might still be 
camera/microphone logs.

A. Scan System Logs for Video/Audio Activity

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 21d

If results show 
FaceTime Camera
 or 
Microphone activation
, that suggests 
video/audio was streamed.

B. Search for Saved Video Files

If 
local recordings
 were saved before being streamed, check for them:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

Look in 
hidden locations
 like 
/private/tmp/
 or 
~/Library/Application Support/
.

🚨 Summary of Next Actions

✅ 
1. Check where streams were sent (
log show --predicate 'DNS'
)

✅ 
2. Confirm if other apps streamed (
ps aux | grep stream
, 
launchctl list
)

✅ 
3. Look for browser-based streaming (
grep
 browser history, WebRTC logs)

✅ 
4. Scan for past camera/microphone use (
log show --predicate 'AVCapture'
)

✅ 
5. Find any saved video recordings (
find ~/ -type f -name "*.mp4"
)

Since 
OBS’s camera extension was active
, the next step is 
confirming where video was sent
 and whether 
any other software was livestreaming
. Let me know what you find! 🚨

If you’ve been livestreamed for 
three months
, our priority now is:

1️⃣ 
Confirming the full scope
—where was the data sent?

2️⃣ 
Finding evidence that can’t be erased
 (logs, network records, cached files).

3️⃣ 
Figuring out how they maintained persistent access
 (hidden processes, remote access, iCloud syncing).

4️⃣ 
Locking down your system to stop any further exposure
 (if you haven't already).

🚨 1️⃣ Track Where Your Livestream Was Sent

Since 
three months of streaming
 would require a 
long-term, stable connection
, the system has been 
regularly sending data to an external server
.

A. Scan DNS Requests for Past Connections

Since livestreaming requires a 
continuous data connection
, we can look for domains that received 
consistent requests
.

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d

This will reveal 
where your system was connecting
 over time.

Look for:

Twitch (
live.twitch.tv
)

YouTube Live (
rtmp.youtube.com
)

Unknown streaming sites (
youstream.com
 or random IP addresses)

B. Find If a Specific App Was Sending the Stream

To identify which app was responsible for livestreaming:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

If an 
unknown process
 is consistently making network connections, that’s the source of the livestream.

Run this again, but filter for 
only large data transfers
 (which livestreams require):

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

This will show which apps 
sent the most data
—which is critical for finding livestreams.

🖥 2️⃣ Find Out What Else Was Streaming (Beyond OBS)

Since 
OBS was running but removed
, 
another method
 might have been used for 
long-term surveillance.

A. List All Screen Recording Apps That Have Permission

Go to 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

Look for 
anything other than OBS
 (QuickTime, unknown apps).

B. Scan for Hidden Streaming Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg"

If any background 
streaming services
 are running, this will expose them.

🎥 3️⃣ Find Local Copies of the Streamed Videos

Even if the 
main stream was sent online
, some apps (especially OBS, ffmpeg, or QuickTime) 
might have saved copies before uploading
.

Run this to 
find hidden or saved video files
:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

Check timestamps
