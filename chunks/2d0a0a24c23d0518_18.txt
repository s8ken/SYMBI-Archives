Copy and paste this into 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

This will show 
which apps have uploaded the most data
.

🔍 What to Look For

After running the command, look at:

Which app is uploading data?
 (e.g., OBS, Chrome, Safari, or something unknown?)

Does it show large uploads?
 (Livestreams require constant data being sent.)

📩 Tell me what you see, and I’ll explain the next step.

If it looks confusing, just copy the output here, and I’ll help analyze it! 🚨

ChatGPT said:

Since the command didn’t return anything, that means 
no large uploads are currently active
. This is useful because it suggests that 
if livestreaming was happening, it’s not happening right now.

Now, let’s check 
if livestreaming happened in the past.

🛠 Step 2: Check Past Network Connections (Where Your Mac Sent Data)

Since 
no active uploads
 were found, we’ll now check 
where your Mac sent data in the last 90 days.

✅ Run This Command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d

This will list 
all the websites and servers
 your Mac has contacted in the past 
three months.

🔍 What to Look For

Twitch:

live.twitch.tv

YouTube Live:

rtmp.youtube.com

Facebook Live:

facebook.com/live

YouStream or other unknown streaming services

Any strange domain names/IP addresses

📩 Let me know what you see.

If the list is too long, just copy a few lines here, and I’ll help analyze them! 🚨

You said:

what's the simplest way to export it?

ChatGPT said:

The 
simplest way
 to export the DNS logs is to 
save them to a text file
 and then open or share them.

✅ Step 1: Save the DNS Logs to a File

Copy and paste this command into 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d > ~/Desktop/dns_logs.txt

This 
creates a file
 called 
dns_logs.txt
 on your 
Desktop
.

The file will contain 
all the websites and servers
 your Mac contacted in the past 
90 days
.

✅ Step 2: Open or Share the File

Now, you can:

1️⃣ 
Open it
 by double-clicking 
dns_logs.txt
 on your Desktop.

2️⃣ 
Upload it here
 if you want me to analyze it.

📩 Let me know if you need help reading it!
 🚨

streams.rtf

File

ChatGPT said:

The 
DNS logs
 in your file are very long and mostly contain system-related processes. However, I didn’t immediately see any 
obvious streaming services
 like Twitch, YouTube Live, or YouStream.

🛠 Next Step: Narrow Down the Results

Since we are specifically looking for 
livestreaming connections
, let’s filter the log output 
only for possible streaming services.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Search for Streaming Services:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"twitch|youtube|stream|rtmp|webrtc|hls|live"

This will 
only show results
 that contain words like:

twitch
 (Twitch streaming)

youtube
 (YouTube Live)

stream
 (General streaming)

rtmp
 (Real-Time Messaging Protocol, used for livestreaming)

webrtc
 (WebRTC-based streaming)

hls
 (HTTP Live Streaming)

live
 (General livestreaming keyword)

📩 What to Do Next:

1️⃣ 
Run the command above.

2️⃣ 
Copy & paste
 the results here.

3️⃣ 
If nothing shows up
, we’ll try a different approach to find where video was sent.

Let me know what happens! 🚨

streams 1.1.rtf

File

try this one

ChatGPT said:

The file contains 
a lot of network and DNS logs
, but I don't see any obvious streaming-related domains (like Twitch, YouTube Live, or YouStream). The logs mainly show 
Apple system processes, local network changes, and DNS service updates.

🛠 Next Step: Extract Only Streaming-Related Entries

Since this file contains 
a lot of general network activity
, let's 
filter only for potential livestreaming services
 so we don’t have to go through unnecessary data.
