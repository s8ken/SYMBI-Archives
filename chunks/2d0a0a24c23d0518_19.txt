This will:

Remove unnecessary system messages.

Show only DNS queries related to 
streaming, RTMP, WebRTC, or live broadcasts.

🚨 If this still doesn’t show anything, we’ll take another approach by checking 
browser history and network uploads instead.

the material itself if pornographic in nature and this is designed as a doxing or reaction video attempt - it will not be on major platforms 

ChatGPT said:

Understood—this makes things more complex because it means the 
livestream was likely sent to a private or obscure platform
, not mainstream services like 
Twitch or YouTube Live.

We need to take a 
different approach
 to 
find where the data was sent
 and 
how they maintained access.

🛠 Step 1: Look for Unknown Streaming Servers

Since this was not on 
major platforms
, we need to find 
any unknown IPs or domains
 that may have received the stream.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Extract Suspicious Connections

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"live|stream|rtmp|cdn|video|upload"

🔍 
What to Look For:

Unknown domain names
 (not Twitch, YouTube, or known websites).

CDN services
 (content delivery networks that store video).

Raw IP addresses
 instead of domain names (suggesting a private server).

📩 
If you see anything strange, copy it here, and I’ll help analyze it.

🖥 Step 2: Check for Hidden Remote Access (To Maintain Streaming)

Since this has been happening 
for months
, they likely 
maintained access to your Mac
.

✅ Run This to Check for Remote Access:

sh

Copy

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

🔍 
Look for Suspicious Open Ports:

5900
 → VNC (Remote Screen Sharing)

22
 → SSH (Remote Terminal Access)

443, 5223
 → Apple iCloud Sync & Remote Access

Any unknown ports

🚨 
If a strange port is open, it may be how they controlled your Mac.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Run the DNS search (
log show --predicate 'DNS' | grep "stream"
).

2️⃣ 
Run the remote access check (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
).

3️⃣ 
Copy any unknown IPs, ports, or domains here, and I’ll help analyze them.

This will 
help track where the video was sent
 and 
how they kept control of your device.
 Let me know what you find! 🚨

File

ChatGPT said:

Your logs contain 
a lot of Apple system activity
 (related to video processing, wallpapers, Photos, and videoconferencing), but I don’t see any 
clear evidence of livestreaming to an external service
 yet.

Key Findings So Far:

1️⃣ 
Apple VideoConference & CoreMedia Processes

This suggests 
video was processed
, but it doesn’t confirm streaming.

It could be 
FaceTime, QuickTime, or a third-party app accessing the camera.

2️⃣ 
No Obvious Streaming Platforms Found

No 
RTMP, WebRTC, or external livestreaming servers
 were found.

This suggests the 
streaming was either hidden or logs were cleared.

🚨 Next Step: Find Out If an Unknown IP Was Receiving the Stream

Since no 
mainstream platforms
 were detected, let’s check 
which IP addresses your Mac connected to.

✅ Run This in Terminal to See Past Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
What to Look For:

Unknown IP addresses
 that your Mac connected to.

Any 
non-Apple or non-Google servers
 that could be a private streaming platform.

📩 
Copy the results here, and I’ll help analyze them.
 If we find a 
suspicious IP address
, we can trace it to see where your stream was sent. 🚨
