Understood! If 
video conferencing services
 were involved, it’s likely the stream was sent 
through a meeting platform or a hidden WebRTC connection.

Now, we need to figure out:

1️⃣ 
Which video conferencing app was used?

2️⃣ 
Was it a real call, or was video secretly sent in the background?

3️⃣ 
Where was the data sent?

🛠 Step 1: Find Out Which Video Conferencing App Was Used

Since the logs show 
video conferencing activity
, let’s check 
which app accessed the camera/mic.

✅ Run This in Terminal to See Camera/Microphone Usage

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If you see 
AVCaptureDevice
 logs, they will show 
which app activated your camera or mic
.

Look for 
FaceTime, Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or unknown services.

🖥 Step 2: Find If a WebRTC Call or Stream Was Running

Since video conferencing often uses 
WebRTC
, we need to check if 
your Mac was in an unknown call.

✅ Run This to Search for WebRTC Calls

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If WebRTC logs appear, it means 
your video/audio were streamed via a browser-based call.

The logs may include 
URLs or IP addresses
 related to the call.

🌐 Step 3: Find Out Where the Video Was Sent

Now, let’s check 
what external IPs your Mac sent data to.

✅ Run This to See Active Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any 
unknown IP addresses
 that aren’t Apple, Google, or common services.

If we find a 
suspicious IP
, we can trace where the video was sent.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Run the camera/microphone check (
log show --predicate "AVCapture"
).

2️⃣ 
Run the WebRTC scan (
log show --predicate "webrtc"
).

3️⃣ 
Run the network connection check (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
).

🚨 
If you find anything strange (unknown apps, WebRTC calls, or unknown IPs), copy the results here, and I’ll help analyze them.

I don't use FaceTime

Since you 
don’t use FaceTime
, but 
video conferencing activity appeared in the logs
, that means 
some other app was accessing your camera/microphone.

This could be:

1️⃣ 
A hidden WebRTC call
 (browser-based video streaming).

2️⃣ 
A third-party video conferencing app (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc.).

3️⃣ 
A compromised app or malware using your camera/microphone.

🛠 Step 1: Find Out Which App Used the Camera/Microphone

Since FaceTime wasn’t involved, let’s check 
which app actually accessed your camera.

✅ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If 
AVCaptureDevice
 logs appear, they will show 
which app activated your camera/mic
.

Look for 
Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or any unknown app.

🖥 Step 2: Find If a WebRTC Call or Stream Was Running

Since 
FaceTime wasn’t used
, we need to check if a 
WebRTC-based call
 (browser-based streaming) was active.

✅ Run This to Search for WebRTC Calls

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If WebRTC logs appear, it means 
video/audio were streamed via a browser.

The logs may include 
URLs or IP addresses
 related to the call.

📩 
If WebRTC activity is found, we can trace where the stream was sent.

🌐 Step 3: Find Out Where the Video Was Sent

Now, let’s check 
what external IPs your Mac sent data to.

✅ Run This to See Active Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
What to Look For:

Unknown IP addresses
 that aren’t Apple, Google, or common services.

If a 
suspicious IP
 appears, we can
