 if a WebRTC call was active (
log show --predicate "webrtc"
).

3️⃣ 
Look at external network connections (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
).

Since FaceTime wasn’t used, another app secretly accessed your camera. Let’s find out which one.

Since the 
AVCapture logs
 didn't return anything, this means:

1️⃣ 
Logs may have been cleared
 (either manually or by an attacker).

2️⃣ 
The streaming app may have used a different method to access video/audio
 (bypassing Apple's AVCapture framework).

3️⃣ 
The stream may have been relayed from a different device (iPhone/iPad) via Sidecar, AirPlay, or remote access.

🛠 Next Step: Check for WebRTC or Unknown Video Calls

Since 
AVCapture didn’t log anything
, the video could have been 
streamed through a WebRTC connection (browser-based).

✅ Run This to Search for WebRTC Calls

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If WebRTC logs appear, it means 
video/audio were streamed via a browser.

The logs may include 
URLs or IP addresses
 related to the call.

📩 
If WebRTC activity is found, we can trace where the stream was sent.

🌐 Step 2: Find Out Where the Video Was Sent

Now, let’s check 
which external servers your Mac connected to.

✅ Run This to See Active Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
What to Look For:

Unknown IP addresses
 that aren’t Apple, Google, or common services.

If a 
suspicious IP
 appears, we can 
trace where the video was sent.

📩 
Copy any strange IP addresses here, and I’ll help identify them.

Since 
both AVCapture and WebRTC logs returned nothing
, this suggests one of the following:

1️⃣ 
The logs were intentionally cleared
 (by the system, an attacker, or a cleanup process).

2️⃣ 
A non-standard method was used for streaming
, such as:

A hidden virtual camera or video driver
 (not using AVCapture/WebRTC).

Remote screen sharing or mirroring
 (VNC, AirPlay, Sidecar).

A direct peer-to-peer connection
 (without traditional logging).

3️⃣ 
The video stream originated from another device
, such as your 
iPhone, iPad, or another Mac
 using iCloud syncing or Sidecar.

🛠 Next Step: Check If Remote Access or Screen Mirroring Was Used

If the video stream didn’t go through normal logging systems, it might have been done 
via remote access, screen sharing, or Sidecar.

✅ Run This to Check for Open Remote Access Services

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep LISTEN

🔍 
What to Look For:

5900
 → VNC (Remote Screen Sharing)

22
 → SSH (Remote Terminal Access)

443, 5223
 → Apple iCloud Sync & Remote Access

Any unknown ports

🚨 
If any of these services are open, it could mean someone accessed your Mac remotely.

🖥 Step 2: Check If Sidecar or AirPlay Was Used for Mirroring

If your 
Mac’s screen was streamed to another device
, Sidecar or AirPlay could have been used.

✅ Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "airplay" OR eventMessage contains "sidecar"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

AirPlay activi
