ty
 → Screen mirroring to a hidden device.

Sidecar activity
 → iPad used as a secondary display (without your knowledge).

📩 
If anything strange appears, let me know, and I’ll help analyze it.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check for remote access (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
).

2️⃣ 
Check if AirPlay or Sidecar was used (
log show --predicate "airplay OR sidecar"
).

🚨 
Since no AVCapture or WebRTC logs exist, we need to check if your screen was streamed remotely.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

Got it—since 
OBS uses a virtual camera and screen sharing was involved
, the livestream likely bypassed 
AVCapture and WebRTC logging
 by using:

1️⃣ 
OBS Virtual Camera
 (allows apps to access screen/audio as if it’s a real webcam).

2️⃣ 
Screen Sharing (VNC, Remote Desktop, AirPlay, or Sidecar).

3️⃣ 
Direct streaming via RTMP or a hidden peer-to-peer service.

Now, we need to 
trace exactly where the data was sent
 and 
how screen sharing was used.

🛠 Step 1: Find Where OBS & Screen Sharing Sent the Stream

Since 
OBS doesn’t show in AVCapture logs
, let’s check 
where it connected.

✅ Run This in Terminal to List Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any unknown IP addresses.

Connections to RTMP servers (if streaming was live).

📩 
If you see strange IPs, copy them here, and I’ll help trace where the video went.

🖥 Step 2: Find Out How Screen Sharing Was Used

Since 
you confirmed screen sharing was involved
, we need to check:

1️⃣ 
If VNC, AirPlay, or Sidecar was used for remote access.

2️⃣ 
If any unknown device was mirroring your screen.

✅ Run This to Find Past Screen Sharing Events

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If a screen-sharing session was started.

If an unknown device accessed your Mac remotely.

📩 
If anything suspicious appears, let me know, and I’ll analyze it.

🌐 Step 3: Check If OBS Streamed to an RTMP Server

OBS typically sends streams 
directly to a streaming server (RTMP, HLS, or another protocol).

✅ Run This to Look for RTMP Stream Logs

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "rtmp"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If 
rtmp://
 appears, that means 
OBS was sending video to a live streaming service.

If an unknown RTMP server appears, we can trace it.

📩 
If any streaming server shows up, copy it here, and I’ll help analyze where the stream went.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Find out where OBS or screen sharing sent video (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
).

2️⃣ 
Check for past screen-sharing sessions (
log show --predicate "screensharing"
).

3️⃣ 
Look for RTMP stream logs (
log show --predicate "rtmp"
).

🚨 
Since OBS Virtual Camera & screen sharing were involved, we need to confirm if video was sent to an RTMP server or mirrored to another device.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!
