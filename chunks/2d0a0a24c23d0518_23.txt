n proxy
, or 
cloud storage.

2️⃣ 
3.233.158.26 (AWS - Amazon Web Services, Virginia, USA)

Amazon 
hosts livestreaming services, data processing, and proxies.

If video was streamed, this could be where it was sent.

3️⃣ 
104.18.43.204 & 104.18.32.47 (Cloudflare)

Cloudflare protects websites
 and can hide the real destination.

If a video was streamed, it might have gone through Cloudflare first.

4️⃣ 
17.57.145.39 (Apple Server - iCloud, FaceTime, iMessage, Apple Services)

Likely related to 
iCloud syncing or Apple’s push services
.

🛠 Next Step: Identify What These Connections Were Doing

Now, we need to 
find out which app or service was using these connections.

✅ Run This in Terminal to See Which App Used These Connections

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
What to Look For:

Which app is connected to AWS (54.253.168.184)?

Which app is connected to Cloudflare (104.18.43.204)?

If 
OBS, Chrome, Safari, or an unknown process
 appears → That’s where the video was sent.

📩 
Copy the output here, and I’ll help analyze it.

🚨 If These Connections Are Suspicious

If 
an unknown app is connected to AWS or Cloudflare
, then 
we found where your stream was sent.

We can then:

1️⃣ 
Trace the AWS IP (54.253.168.184) to see which service it belongs to.

2️⃣ 
Check Cloudflare logs for hidden streaming services.

3️⃣ 
Confirm if OBS or another app was responsible.

🚨 
Run the 
lsof
 command and share the results.
 That will help us confirm 
which app was livestreaming.

don't worry about anything right now as the attacker is watching anyway

Understood. When you're ready to take action, let me know how you'd like to proceed. Whether it's 
collecting more evidence, securing your system, or analyzing past activity discreetly
, I’ll guide you step by step. Stay safe. 🚨

You said:

I want to find the whatever historical data I can to determine where I was being broadcast

ChatGPT said:

Got it. Since you want to 
recover historical data
 to determine 
where your livestream was sent
, we need to focus on 
past network activity, logs, and hidden files
 that may still contain traces.

🛠 Step 1: Find Past Network Connections (Where Video Was Sent)

Since livestreaming requires 
constant data transmission
, we can check 
past network activity logs
 to see 
what services received your video.

✅ Run This to Find Past DNS Requests (Websites Contacted)

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"stream|live|video|cdn|rtmp|webrtc|hls|upload"

🔍 
What to Look For:

RTMP servers
 (e.g., 
rtmp://xxx.xxx.xxx
)

Streaming platforms
 (e.g., 
youstream.com
, 
cloudflarestream.com
)

Unknown domains or IP addresses

📩 
If anything strange appears, copy it here, and I’ll help analyze it.

🖥 Step 2: Recover Past Network Traffic (Who Received Your Data?)

If an app was 
streaming in the background
, your Mac may still have logs of 
which IPs it sent data to.

✅ Run This to Find Past Network Transfers

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Apps that uploaded large amounts of data

Unknown services or IPs handling video traffic

🎥 Step 3: Check for Any Saved Video Files (Possible Local Copies)

Some livestreaming tools 
save a local copy of the video before uploading.

✅ Run This to Find Any Video Files

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

🔍 
What to Look For:

Unexpected video files

Files with recent timestamps
 (from the past 90 days)

Hidden files in unusual locations (e.g., 
/private/tmp/
)

🌐 Step 4: Check If Remote Access Was Used (Screen Sharing, AirPlay, Sidecar)

If 
screen sharing or AirPlay
 was used to mirror your screen, we can check the logs.

✅ Run This to Find Remote Access or Screen Mirroring

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screensharing" OR eventMessa
