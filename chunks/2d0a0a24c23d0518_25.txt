our latest logs show a 
lot of upload activity
, but the majority of it appears to be 
Apple system processes
 like:

com.apple.diagnosticpipeline.cloudkit_expedited_upload

 (Apple diagnostics being sent to iCloud)

com.apple.security.syspolicy.sample-upload

 (Apple’s system policy reports)

com.apple.photos.uploaddownloadcount

 (iCloud Photos uploading)

com.apple.cloudphotod

com.apple.safari

Key Issue: We Don’t See Direct Streaming Logs Yet

While there are 
many uploads
, we don’t yet see a direct 
RTMP, WebRTC, or OBS-related connection
 that would confirm a livestream destination.

🛠 Next Steps: Dig Deeper for Hidden Streaming Logs

Since 
OBS and screen sharing were involved
, we need to look for 
hidden logs
 that might not show in regular Apple system logs.

✅ Run This to Find Any RTMP or WebRTC Streaming Activity

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "rtmp" OR eventMessage contains "webrtc" OR eventMessage contains "broadcast"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any mention of RTMP servers (
rtmp://…
).

Any WebRTC connections (
webrtc://…
).

Any "broadcast" activity (which may indicate a hidden stream).

📩 
If anything appears, copy the results here.

🖥 Step 2: Check for Hidden Video Files or Local Stream Copies

Some streaming software saves 
local copies of the broadcast
 before sending it.

✅ Run This to Find Any Video Files on Your Mac

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

🔍 
What to Look For:

Recently created video files.

Unusual file locations (e.g., hidden folders).

📩 
If you find unexpected videos, copy the file paths here.

🌐 Step 3: Find Any Past Streaming Websites Accessed

If a 
livestreaming service was used
, we can check 
browser history and past DNS lookups
 to see where video might have been sent.

✅ Run This to See Past Streaming Websites Contacted

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"stream|live|video|rtmp|webrtc|cdn|upload"

🔍 
What to Look For:

Streaming sites (
youstream.com
, 
cloudflarestream.com
).

Any unknown domains that look suspicious.

📩 
If any strange domains appear, copy them here for analysis.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Find any hidden RTMP/WebRTC logs (
log show --predicate "rtmp OR webrtc OR broadcast"
).

2️⃣ 
Check for local saved video files (
find ~/ -type f -name "*.mp4"
).

3️⃣ 
Look at past DNS requests (
log show --predicate "DNS" | grep "stream"
).

🚨 
This will help us confirm where video was sent and whether copies exist on your system.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

Since 
RTMP, WebRTC, and broadcast logs came up empty
, this means:

1️⃣ 
The logs were cleared or overwritten
 (either manually, by the system, or by an attacker).

2️⃣ 
A hidden streaming method was used
, possibly:

OBS Virtual Camera
 (which wouldn’t log RTMP/WebRTC activity).

Screen Sharing (VNC, AirPlay, Sidecar)
 instead of traditional livestreaming.

A direct peer-to-peer stream (hidden traffic, no logs in system processes).

🛠 Next Step: Check for Local Video Files (Possible Copies of the Stream)

If a livestream happened, 
OBS or another tool may have saved a local copy.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Find Any Video Files

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

🔍 
What to Look For:

Recently created video files.

Hidden files or files in strange locations
