 your screen to another unknown device (Apple TV, Mac, etc.).

🛠 Next Step: Find Out If Your iPad Was Used for Mirroring

Since you actively use the iPad, we need to confirm 
if it was being used for legitimate purposes or if someone else accessed it.

✅ Step 1: Check Sidecar Connections

Run this on your 
Mac
 (to see if an iPad was used as a display):

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep 

"Sidecar"

🔍 
What to Look For:

If your 
iPad appears
, it means Sidecar was used for screen mirroring.

If an 
unknown device appears
, that’s a problem.

✅ Step 2: Check AirPlay Connection History

Run this on your 
Mac
 (to see if your screen was sent elsewhere):

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay

🔍 
What to Look For:

Look for 
"LastConnected"
 → This may show the 
last AirPlay device your Mac connected to.

If an 
unknown Apple TV, Mac, or device appears
, that may have received your screen.

✅ Step 3: Check iPad Screen Recording & Streaming

Since the iPad was used, let's check if it was 
streaming or recording
 the screen:

📱 
On Your iPad:

Go to Settings → Control Center

Check if "Screen Recording" is in the Control Center

If it is, swipe down and check if it was recently activated.

Go to Settings → General → AirPlay & Handoff

Check if 
AirPlay Mirroring
 was turned on recently.

📩 
Let me know if anything suspicious appears!

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if your iPad was actively used for Sidecar (
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
).

2️⃣ 
Find out if your screen was AirPlayed to another device (
defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay
).

3️⃣ 
Check your iPad's screen recording & AirPlay settings.

🚨 
If your iPad was mirroring your Mac screen, we need to confirm if it was then rebroadcasted.

Since 
Sidecar did not return any results
, that means:

1️⃣ 
Your iPad was NOT actively used as a Sidecar display at this moment.

2️⃣ 
If your Mac screen was sent to your iPad, it may have been done through AirPlay instead.

3️⃣ 
We now need to check AirPlay logs to see if an unknown device was involved.

🛠 Next Step: Check If AirPlay Was Used

Since 
Sidecar is not the culprit
, let’s confirm if 
AirPlay was used to mirror your Mac’s screen
 to another device.

✅ Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay

🔍 
What to Look For:

"LastConnected"
 → This may show the 
last AirPlay device your Mac connected to.

If an 
unknown Apple TV, Mac, or other device appears
, it may have received your screen.

📩 
Copy the output here, and I’ll help analyze it.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if AirPlay was used to send your screen to another device (
defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay
).

2️⃣ 
If we find an unknown device, we will trace it further.

🚨 
Since Sidecar wasn’t used, we now focus on AirPlay as the most likely method.
 Run this and let me know what you find!

🔍 Analysis of Your AirPlay and Sidecar Checks

1️⃣ 
Sidecar is NOT active
 → Your Mac was NOT using your iPad as a secondary display.

2️⃣ 
AirPlay is NOT currently active (
receiver-active = 0
)
 → Your Mac is NOT currently acting as an AirPlay receiver.

🚨 What This Means

Right now, neither Sidecar nor AirPlay are actively mirroring your screen.

However, this 
does NOT rule out past AirPlay connections
 or 
remote screen sharing via another method.

If your screen was streamed, it was likely done through:

A previous AirPlay connection (logs may have been erased).

A third-party app (Zoom, OBS, another streaming tool).

A hidden screen-sharing
