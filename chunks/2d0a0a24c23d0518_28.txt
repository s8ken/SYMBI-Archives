 service (VNC, Remote Desktop, malware).

🛠 Next Step: Find Out If Screen Sharing Was Used

Since AirPlay isn’t currently active, let’s check if 
Apple’s built-in Screen Sharing or another remote access tool was used instead.

✅ Run This in Terminal to See If Screen Sharing Was Active

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

If there are 
logs of screen-sharing sessions
, that means your Mac’s screen 
was accessed remotely.

Look for 
mentions of unknown devices or IP addresses.

📩 
If anything shows up, copy the output here, and I’ll help analyze it.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if Screen Sharing was active (
log show --predicate "screensharing"
).

2️⃣ 
If screen sharing logs exist, we will trace where the connection was sent.

🚨 
Since Sidecar and AirPlay are not active now, the most likely explanation is remote screen sharing.
 Run this and let me know what you find!

ChatGPT said:

Since 
screen sharing logs came up empty
, this suggests:

1️⃣ 
The logs were cleared
 (either by the system or an attacker).

2️⃣ 
A different remote access method was used
 (not Apple's built-in Screen Sharing).

3️⃣ 
The stream may have been sent through a third-party app (Zoom, OBS, VNC, hidden software).

🛠 Next Step: Check for Hidden Remote Access Services

If your screen was being broadcast, it may have been done through 
VNC, SSH, or another remote access tool.

✅ Run This in Terminal to See If Remote Access Services Are Active

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep LISTEN

🔍 
What to Look For:

5900
 → 
VNC (Remote Screen Sharing)

22
 → 
SSH (Remote Terminal Access)

Any unknown ports
 → Could indicate a hidden backdoor

📩 
If any ports are open that seem suspicious, copy the output here.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if remote access services (VNC, SSH) are running (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
).

2️⃣ 
If any suspicious ports are open, we’ll investigate further.

🚨 
Since Sidecar, AirPlay, and Screen Sharing show no results, the next logical step is checking for hidden remote access methods.
 Run this and let me know what you find!

don't worry about now

ChatGPT said:

Understood. Whenever you're ready to continue investigating, just let me know. Stay safe. 🚨

You said:

I mean we need to look at historical nor current

ChatGPT said:

Got it! We need to 
look at historical remote access activity
, not just what’s currently running. This will help determine if someone 
previously had access to your screen
 or 
remotely controlled your Mac
 for streaming.

🛠 Step 1: Find Historical Remote Access (VNC, SSH, Remote Desktop)

Since 
we didn’t find active connections
, let’s check 
past logs
 for any 
remote access events.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Find Past Remote Access

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "remote"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Mentions of "Remote Login," "VNC," "Screen Sharing," or "SSH".

Any unknown devices or IPs connecting to your Mac.

📩 
If anything appears, copy the output here, and I’ll help analyze it.

🖥 Step 2: Check If Remote Desktop (RDP) or VNC Was Used

Since 
Apple’s Screen Sharing logs were empty
, we’ll check if 
Remote Desktop or VNC were used.

✅ Run This to Find VNC/Remote Desktop Logs

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "vnc" OR eventMessage contains "rdp"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

VNC connections (
com.apple.vncserver
).

Remote Desktop Protocol (
com.microsoft.rdp
).

Unknown IPs accessing your Mac.

📩 
If any remote access activity appears, copy it here.

🌐 Step 3: Find Any Historical SSH (Remote Terminal) Access

If an attacker had access, they may have used 
SSH (Secure Shell) t
