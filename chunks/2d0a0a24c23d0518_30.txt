logins appear, copy them here, and I’ll analyze them.

✅ Step 2: Find Remote Management Sessions

Since 
Apple’s Remote Management was active
, let’s check if 
someone accessed it.

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "remotemanagement"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Mentions of remote sessions or connections.

Devices or IP addresses that connected.

📩 
Copy any suspicious results here.

🎥 Step 3: Find Out If Your Camera Was Used

Since 
video processing was running
, we need to check 
if your webcam was accessed.

✅ Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Which app accessed your webcam.

If it happened during a remote session.

📩 
If anything looks unusual, copy it here.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Find past SSH logins (
log show --predicate "sshd"
).

2️⃣ 
Check for remote management access (
log show --predicate "remotemanagement"
).

3️⃣ 
See if your webcam was used (
log show --predicate "camera"
).

🚨 
Since remote access was confirmed, we need to identify who connected and when.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

Since 
no SSH logs appeared
, this suggests:

1️⃣ 
SSH (Secure Shell) was NOT the method used for remote access.

2️⃣ 
Remote control may have been done through another service (Apple Remote Management, VNC, or a hidden tool).

3️⃣ 
The logs may have been cleared to hide past activity.

🛠 Next Step: Check for Apple Remote Management & VNC Access

Since 
SSH didn’t show activity
, let’s check if 
Apple’s Remote Management or VNC
 was used instead.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Find Remote Management Logins

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "remotemanagement"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Mentions of remote desktop sessions.

Unknown devices or IP addresses accessing your Mac.

📩 
If anything appears, copy the results here.

✅ Step 2: Check for VNC (Screen Sharing) Logins

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "vnc"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any VNC connections.

Possible remote screen-sharing attempts.

📩 
If something suspicious shows up, let me know.

🎥 Step 3: Check If Your Camera Was Used

Since 
video processing was running
, we need to confirm if your 
webcam was accessed.

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Which app accessed your webcam?

Did it happen during a remote session?

📩 
Copy any unusual results here.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check for remote management access (
log show --predicate "remotemanagement"
).

2️⃣ 
Find VNC screen sharing attempts (
log show --predicate "vnc"
).

3️⃣ 
Check if the webcam was accessed (
log show --predicate "camera"
).

🚨 
If remote access happened, it wasn’t through SSH, but likely VNC or Apple Remote Management.
 Let me know what you find!

🔍 Analysis of Your SSH Logs

Your logs 
confirm that SSH (
sshd
) was involved in a system migration process on

February 25, 2025
. The key findings:

1️⃣ 
SSH Configuration Was Migrated

Log entry: "will migrate a rule: Copy 'sshd_config' to Alt. Location"

This suggests that 
SSH settings were altered or moved.

Possible explanations:

A system update or migration moved SSH settings.

An attacker tampered with SSH settings
 to enable remote access.

2️⃣ 
SSH User Identified as 
_sshd
 (System Account)

Entry: "Processing '_sshd' (GID: 75 UID: ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF0000004B)"

_sshd
 is the 
default system account for SSH connections.

If an attacker used SSH, they might have hidden logs or modified this account.

🚨 What This Means

SSH was definitely involved in a s
