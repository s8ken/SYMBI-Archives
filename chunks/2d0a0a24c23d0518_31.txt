ystem-level migration.

There’s no direct proof of a remote connection (yet), but the SSH configuration was modified.

An attacker could have enabled persistent SSH access and hidden logs.

🛠 Next Steps: Find If SSH Was Used for Remote Access

Since we now know 
SSH settings were modified
, let’s check 
if anyone actually logged in.

✅ Step 1: Check SSH Login History

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see past SSH logins:

sh

Copy

last | grep 

"sshd"

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any remote IPs that logged into SSH.

Suspicious login attempts.

📩 
If anything strange appears, copy the results here.

✅ Step 2: Check If SSH Remote Login Is Enabled

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see if SSH is currently enabled:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

🔍 
If it says 
Remote Login: On

, then SSH is still enabled → meaning 
someone could be accessing your Mac remotely.

📩 
Let me know what it says!

✅ Step 3: Check the SSH Configuration File

Since the logs mention 
sshd_config
 was modified, let’s see what’s inside it:

sh

Copy

cat

 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

🔍 
What to Look For:

PermitRootLogin yes

 → Allows attackers to log in as root.

AllowUsers
 or 
AllowGroups

 → See if any unknown users are listed.

Any unknown IPs or commands.

📩 
If you see anything unusual, copy the lines here.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check past SSH logins (
last | grep "sshd"
).

2️⃣ 
See if SSH is still enabled (
systemsetup -getremotelogin
).

3️⃣ 
Inspect the SSH config file for suspicious settings (
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
).

🚨 
Since SSH settings were modified, we need to confirm if it was used for unauthorized access.
 Run these checks and let me know what you find!

Since 

last | grep "sshd"
 returned nothing
, this suggests:

1️⃣ 
No recorded SSH logins from external sources.

2️⃣ 
If SSH was used for remote access, the logs may have been deleted or altered.

3️⃣ 
The SSH settings were modified (confirmed earlier), but there’s no proof of direct remote logins.

🛠 Next Step: Confirm If SSH Remote Login Is Still Enabled

Even if no past logins appear, SSH 
might still be active
, allowing someone to connect in the future.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Check If SSH Remote Login Is Enabled

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

🔍 
What to Look For:

If it says 

Remote Login: On

, SSH is still open and can be accessed remotely.

If it says 

Remote Login: Off

, SSH is disabled, meaning no one can use it.

📩 
Let me know the result!

🎯 Step 2: Check SSH Configuration for Suspicious Entries

Since we saw that 
sshd_config
 was modified, let’s inspect its contents.

✅ Run This in Terminal to View SSH Config File

sh

Copy

cat

 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

🔍 
What to Look For:

PermitRootLogin yes

 → Allows remote root access (risky).

AllowUsers
 or 
AllowGroups

 → Lists users allowed to log in via SSH.

Any unknown usernames, IPs, or modifications.

📩 
If anything looks strange, copy the lines here.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if SSH is still enabled (
systemsetup -getremotelogin
).

2️⃣ 
Look for suspicious settings in the SSH config file (
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
).

🚨 
Since SSH settings were modified, we need to confirm if it’s still open and secure.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

🔍 Analysis of SSH Remote Login Status

✅ 
SSH Remote Login is OFF
 → This means 
no one can currently access your Mac via SSH.

What this confirms:

SSH was modified in the past
, but 
it’s not active now.

If an attacker used SSH before, they likely disabled it to avoid detection.

There may have been another method used for remote access (VNC, hidden services).

🛠 Next Step: Check If Any Suspicious SSH Settings Were Left Behind

Even though SSH is 
off
, an attacker may have
