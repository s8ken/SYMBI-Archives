kdoor access in the SSH config file.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Check SSH Configuration

sh

Copy

cat

 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

🔍 
What to Look For:

PermitRootLogin yes

 → This would allow direct root access (should be 
no
).

AllowUsers
 or 
AllowGroups

 → Lists usernames allowed to connect via SSH.

Any unknown IP addresses or settings.

📩 
If you see anything suspicious, copy the lines here, and I’ll help analyze them.

🎯 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check SSH config file for hidden access (
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
).

2️⃣ 
If there’s nothing suspicious, we’ll shift focus to checking for past VNC or Remote Desktop access.

🚨 
Since SSH is disabled, remote access likely happened through another method.
 Let me know what the SSH config shows!

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# NOTE: The following Include directive is not part of the default
# sshd_config shipped with OpenSSH. Options set in the included
# configuration files generally override those that follow. The defaults
# only apply to options that have not been explicitly set. Options that
# appear multiple times keep the first value set, unless they are a
# multivalue option such as HostKey or IdentityFile.

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
