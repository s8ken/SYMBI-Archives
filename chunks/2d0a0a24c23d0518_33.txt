🔍 Analysis of Your SSH Configuration & Status

✅ 
SSH Remote Login is OFF
 → No one can currently access your Mac via SSH.

✅ 
No past SSH logins recorded (
last | grep "sshd"
 returned nothing).

✅ 
Your SSH configuration is mostly default.

🚨 What This Means

SSH does not appear to have been actively used for remote access.

No evidence of unauthorized users or open root login (
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
 is commented out, meaning it's disabled by default).

Since SSH settings were migrated (from earlier logs), someone may have tried enabling it but then disabled it again.

🛠 Next Step: Check for Other Remote Access Methods

Since 
SSH does not show direct usage
, we need to 
shift focus to other remote access methods
, such as:

1️⃣ 
Apple Remote Management (VNC, ARD).

2️⃣ 
Hidden remote access software (backdoors, malware).

✅ Step 1: Check for Apple Remote Desktop or VNC Activity

Since 
SSH was not used
, someone may have accessed your Mac through 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) or VNC (Screen Sharing).

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "vnc" OR eventMessage contains "remotemanagement"'

 --last 90d

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any mentions of VNC or Remote Desktop activity.

Unknown devices or IP addresses that connected.

📩 
If anything suspicious appears, copy the results here.

✅ Step 2: Check If Remote Desktop Is Currently Enabled

Even if logs were cleared, we can check 
if remote access is still turned on.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"ard"

🔍 
What to Look For:

If 

Remote Apple Events: On

, it means 
another Mac can control your system.

If 
any ARD (Apple Remote Desktop) services appear
, remote access may still be enabled.

📩 
Let me know what it says!

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check for VNC or Remote Desktop logins (
log show --predicate "vnc OR remotemanagement"
).

2️⃣ 
See if Remote Desktop is still enabled (
systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
 & 
launchctl list | grep -i "ard"
).

🚨 
Since SSH was not used, the most likely attack vector is Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) or VNC.
 Run these and let me know what you find!

🔍 Analysis of Your Remote Management & VNC Logs

Your logs confirm 
remote management activity on February 9 and February 16, 2025
:

1️⃣ 
Apple Remote Management (ARD) Tasks Were Scheduled & Synced

"com.apple.remotemanagement.on-reboot"

"com.apple.remotemanagement.periodic-sync"

These indicate that 
Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop) was enabled
.

This means someone could have remotely controlled your Mac.

2️⃣ 

com.apple.videoconference.camera
 Process Was Running

This suggests 
your webcam was used, possibly during a remote session.

Likely used for screen sharing or video broadcasting.

3️⃣ 
No Direct VNC Connections Logged

No explicit 
VNC remote access attempts
 were recorded in this log.

However, 
Remote Management being active means VNC could still have been used.

🚨 What This Means

Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop) was active, meaning someone could have accessed your Mac remotely.

Your webcam was likely in use during this time.

If VNC was used, the logs may have been cleared to hide access.

🛠 Next Steps: Confirm If Remote Management Is Still Enabled

Even though we confirmed it was 
enabled in t
