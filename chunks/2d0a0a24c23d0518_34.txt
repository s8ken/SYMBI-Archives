he past
, we need to 
check if it is still active now.

✅ Step 1: Check If Remote Management Is Enabled

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -status

🔍 
What to Look For:

If it says 
"Remote Management is active"
, then someone may still have remote access to your Mac.

If it says 
"Remote Management is not active"
, then it was disabled at some point.

📩 
Let me know what the result says!

✅ Step 2: Check If Remote Management Can Be Disabled

Since it was enabled before, let’s 
try disabling it manually
:

sh

Copy

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -stop

🔍 
This will immediately stop any remote access.

📩 
If it fails, let me know what message appears.

✅ Step 3: Check If a Hidden VNC Server Is Running

Since Remote Management was active, we need to check if a 
hidden VNC server
 is still running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screensharingd\|ARD"

🔍 
What to Look For:

If 

screensharingd

 or 

ARD

 appears, it means 
a remote connection is still running.

If nothing appears, Remote Management may have been disabled.

📩 
Let me know if any processes show up!

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if Remote Management is still active (
kickstart -status
).

2️⃣ 
Try disabling Remote Management (
kickstart -deactivate -stop
).

3️⃣ 
Check for hidden remote access services (
ps aux | grep -i "screensharingd\|ARD"
).

🚨 
Since Remote Management was enabled and your webcam was active, we need to confirm if remote access is still happening.
 Run these and let me know what you find!

🔍 Remote Management Status Check Failed

The 

kickstart -status

 command doesn’t work because 
it doesn’t have a built-in status check option.

Instead, we need to use a different method to check if 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is still running.

🛠 Step 1: Check If Remote Management Is Enabled

Run this in 
Terminal
 to check its current status:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"ard"

🔍 
What to Look For:

If you see 
entries related to 
com.apple.ARDAgent

, it means 
Remote Management is still running.

If nothing appears, then 
ARD has been disabled.

📩 
Let me know what you see!

🛠 Step 2: Check If Screen Sharing or VNC Is Running

Since ARD and VNC are connected, let’s check if 
screen sharing is still active.

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo systemsetup -getremoteappleevents

🔍 
What to Look For:

If 

Remote Login: On

 → SSH-based remote access is active.

If 

Remote Apple Events: On

 → Another Mac can send commands to your Mac.

📩 
If these are ON, remote access is still enabled. Let me know the results!

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if Remote Management is running (
launchctl list | grep -i "ard"
).

2️⃣ 
Check if screen sharing or remote commands are active (
systemsetup -getremotelogin && systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
).

🚨 
Since ARD was previously active, we need to confirm if it's still running.
 Run these and let me know what you find!

lets just work on disabling both that and this rogue OBS camera etension

Got it! Let’s 
fully disable both Remote Management (ARD) and the rogue OBS camera extension.

🛠 Step 1: Disable Remote Management & Screen Sharing (ARD/VNC)

Since 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) and screen sharing were active
, we need to 
shut them down completely.

✅ Run This in Terminal to Disable ARD & VNC

sh

Copy

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -stop
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.RemoteDesktop.agent
