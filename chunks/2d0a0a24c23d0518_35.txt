🛠 Step 3: Restart Your Mac to Apply Changes

Since 
Remote Management, Screen Sharing, and OBS Camera were all active
, we need to 
fully restart the system
 to ensure they don’t restart.

✅ Restart Your Mac

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🔍 
This will:

Ensure all remote access services are fully shut down.

Confirm that the OBS camera extension is no longer running.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Disable Remote Management & Screen Sharing (
kickstart -deactivate -stop && launchctl disable system/com.apple.screensharing
).

2️⃣ 
Uninstall OBS Camera (
systemextensionsctl uninstall [UUID]
).

3️⃣ 
Restart Mac (
shutdown -r now
).

🚨 
After restarting, let’s confirm that Remote Management and OBS are completely gone.
 Let me know if you run into any issues!

 to find the exact identifier:

sh

Copy

🛠 Step 2: Unload & Remove the OBS Camera Extension

Once you have the UUID from Step 1, replace it in the command below:

, rebooting now will ensure that:

No background services restart.

OBS Virtual Camera is completely removed.

Remote Management does not re-enable itself.

✅ Restart Your Mac

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Run 
systemextensionsctl list
 to find the OBS Camera extension UUID.

2️⃣ 
Run
