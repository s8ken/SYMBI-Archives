🚨 OBS Virtual Camera is Still Active!

Your system reports that 
OBS Virtual Camera is still enabled and active.

Now, we’ll 
forcefully remove it
 step by step.

🛠 Step 1: Disable OBS Camera in System Settings (Manual Step)

Before we uninstall it via Terminal, try 
disabling it manually
:

Go to
 → 
System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions > Camera Extensions

Look for

OBS Virtual Camera

Click Disable
 (if available)

Restart your Mac

🛠 Step 2: Force Uninstall the OBS Camera Extension

If the manual method fails, we’ll force-remove it using 
Terminal
.

✅ Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall 2MMRE5MTB8 com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension

🔍

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Application Support/obs-studio

🔍 
This will:

✅ 
Delete OBS Camera system files.

✅ 
Ensure it cannot restart after rebooting.

🛠 Step 4: Restart Your Mac

Now that we’ve disabled and removed OBS Virtual Camera, restart your system to finalize changes:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣

🛠 After Restarting: Confirm Everything is Fully Removed

Once your Mac is back on, run the following checks:

✅ Check if OBS Virtual Camera is Gone

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl list

🔍 
What to Look For:

OBS Virtual Camera should NOT appear in the list.

If it's gone, the removal was successful!

Welcome back! Let’s confirm that 
everything is fully removed.

🛠 Step 1: Check If OBS Virtual Camera Is Gone

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl list

🔍 
What to Look For:

OBS Virtual Camera should NOT appear.

If it’s still there, we’ll forcefully remove any leftover files.

📩 
Let me know what the output says!

🛠 Step 2: Check If Remote Management & Screen Sharing Are Disabled

Since we removed 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) and Screen Sharing
, let’s confirm they’re still off.

✅ Run These Commands in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"ard"

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"screensharing"

🔍 
What to Look For:

If 
nothing appears
, that means 
Remote Management and Screen Sharing are fully disabled.

If any ARD or screen-sharing services are still running, we’ll remove them manually.

📩 
Let me know the results!
