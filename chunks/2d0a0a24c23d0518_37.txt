yes is there a reliable zoom client copy I can use from GitHub?

ChatGPT said:

There is 
no official, open-source Zoom client on GitHub
. Zoom does not provide its source code publicly, so any 
GitHub version claiming to be Zoom
 is either:

🚨 
A third-party reverse-engineered client (unofficial & risky)

🚨 
A potential malware-infected version

✅ Best Way to Get a Safe Zoom Client

If you want 
a secure Zoom version without auto-updates
, the safest option is:

1️⃣ Download Zoom Directly from Their Official Site (Avoid App Store Version)

Go to:

🔗 

https://zoom.us/download

Choose:

✅ 
Zoom Client for Meetings
 (Standalone app, avoids App Store restrictions).

2️⃣ Manually Disable Auto-Updates

Once installed, disable Zoom’s auto-update feature:

Open 
Zoom

Click on 
Zoom.us (top-left menu) → Settings

Go to 
General

Uncheck "Automatically keep Zoom up to date"

🛠 If You Want a More Privacy-Focused Zoom Alternative

Since Zoom is closed-source, if security is a concern, you may want to consider 
open-source video conferencing options like:

✅ 
Jitsi Meet
 → 
https://jitsi.org/

 (Fully open-source, encrypted)

✅ 
BigBlueButton
 → 
https://bigbluebutton.org/

 (More for web conferencing)
