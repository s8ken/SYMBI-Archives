its asking if I should allow it to find local networks

🚨 
Deny Zoom from Accessing Local Networks!
 🚨

When Zoom asks 
"Allow Zoom to find and connect to devices on your local network?"
, select:

❌ 
Deny
 (Do Not Allow)

Why?

Prevent unauthorized device discovery
 → Stops Zoom from scanning other devices on your network.

Blocks unnecessary data collection
 → Zoom doesn't need local network access to function properly.

Reduces attack surface
 → If an attacker exploited Zoom, they couldn’t scan your network for vulnerabilities.

🛠 If You Already Allowed It, Disable It

If you accidentally allowed it, disable it manually:

1️⃣ 
Go to macOS System Settings

2️⃣ 
Click "Privacy & Security" → "Local Network"

3️⃣ 
Find Zoom and toggle it OFF

📩 
Let me know if Zoom still behaves strangely after this!

If you ever need to 
double-check its behavior
, run this after a meeting:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "zoom"'

 --last 1d

🔍 
This will show if Zoom tried anything suspicious in the last 24 hours.

Let me know if you ever need more tweaks or security checks! 🔒🚀
