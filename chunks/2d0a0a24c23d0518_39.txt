l Zoom processes (
pkill zoom
).

2️⃣ 
Disable and remove Zoom's auto-update services.

3️⃣ 
Confirm that Zoom is fully removed from background tasks.

🚨 
After this, reboot your Mac and check if Zoom is still running hidden processes.
 Let me know if anything looks suspicious after the reboot!

🚨 Zoom Background Services Are Stubborn!

The error messages suggest that 
Zoom's auto-update services are deeply embedded
, and macOS is preventing them from being unloaded using 
launchctl unload
.

🛠 Solution: Force Remove Using 
bootout

Since 
unload
 failed, we’ll 
forcefully terminate these services
 using 
bootout
:

✅ Step 1: Force Kill Any Running Zoom Processes

sh

Copy

sudo pkill zoom
sudo pkill ZoomOpener
sudo pkill ZoomUpdater

🔍 
This ensures no Zoom processes are actively running before removal.

✅ Step 2: Use 
bootout
 to Force Unload Zoom Services

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

🔍 
This will attempt a stronger removal method for the stuck services.

✅ Step 3: Delete the Zoom Auto-Updater Files

If the above commands succeed, permanently delete the Zoom updater services:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

🔍 
Ensures they cannot restart after rebooting.

✅ Step 4: Confirm Zoom Services Are Gone

After removal, check if any Zoom services are still active:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i zoom
ps aux | grep zoom

🔍 
If anything related to Zoom appears, let me know.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Force remove Zoom’s background services using 
bootout
.

2️⃣ 
Delete the files manually (
rm -rf ...
).

3️⃣ 
Check if Zoom is still running (
launchctl list | grep zoom
).

🚨 
If 
bootout
 fails or Zoom still appears after this, let me know—we may need deeper system access to fully remove it.

🚨 Zoom Auto-Updater Is Stubborn & Won’t Unload

Since both 
unload
 and 
bootout

failed with "Input/output error"
, this suggests:

1️⃣ 
Zoom's updater is locked by the system or running in a protected state.

2️⃣ 
It may be using a hidden process or system integrity protection (SIP) to persist.

🛠 Solution: Force Delete & Manually Remove Zoom Services

Since Zoom’s 
services won’t unload
, we will 
delete the files manually and force a restart.

✅ Step 1: Force Kill Any Running Zoom Services (Again)

Before deleting files, ensure 
no Zoom processes are running
:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill -9 zoom
sudo pkill -9 ZoomOpener
sudo pkill -9 ZoomUpdater

✅ Step 2: Delete Zoom’s Background Services Manually

Since we cannot u
