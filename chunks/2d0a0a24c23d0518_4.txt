 Steps to Track Where the Screen Recordings Were Sent

1️⃣ Identify How the Screen Recordings Were Made

A. Check for Unauthorized Apps with Screen Recording Access

Go to
 → 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

Look for any suspicious apps that have permission (e.g., QuickTime, OBS Studio, Zoom, third-party apps).

Revoke access
 for anything unfamiliar.

B. Check for Active Screen Recording Processes

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screenrecord"

This will show any 
running or hidden screen recording processes
. Look for processes like:

screencapture
 (macOS built-in)

QuickTime

ffmpeg
 (used for custom recordings)

OBS
 (live-streaming software)

C. Check If macOS "screencapture" Command Was Used

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"screencapture"

 ~/.zsh_history

If attackers used the built-in screen capture tool, this will reveal it.

2️⃣ Find Where the Recordings Were Stored

A. Common Locations for Saved Recordings

Check these folders manually or use Terminal:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Movies/

ls

 -lt ~/Desktop/

ls

 -lt ~/Documents/

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/

ls

 -lt /private/tmp/

If attackers tried to 
hide recordings
, they might be in 
/private/tmp/
 or 
~/Library/Application Support/
.

B. Check Recent File Modifications

Run this to see files created in the past 7 days:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f -mtime -7 -

ls

 | grep -i 

".mp4\|.mov\|.avi"

If attackers saved 
screen recordings
, this will show 
when and where
.

3️⃣ Detect Where the Screen Recordings Were Sent

A. Check Browser History for Uploads

Open 
Safari/Chrome → History → Search "upload" or "video"

Look for 
YouStream, YouTube, Twitch, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or other file-sharing services

B. Check Terminal for Past Network Activity

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

This will show active 
internet connections
—look for suspicious 
IP addresses or services
.

C. Scan macOS Logs for Upload Events

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 7d

This will reveal if 
files were uploaded recently
.

D. Look for Cloud Storage Uploads

Check for 
syncing activity
 in:

~/Library/Application Support/Dropbox

~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS/

~/Library/Application Support/OneDrive/

If there are logs or files with recent timestamps, they might have been 
uploaded to the cloud
.

4️⃣ Advanced - Monitor Live Network Traffic

If you suspect 
live broadcasting
, install 
Wireshark
 and filter for:

rtmp
 (used for streaming)

hls
 (HTTP Live Streaming)

udp
 (used for video streams)

🔍 Track OBS Studio Activity

1️⃣ Check OBS Studio Logs for Past Streams or Recordings

OBS keeps logs of every recording and stream.

A. Locate OBS Log Files

Run this in 
Terminal
 to find recent logs:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/

This will show recent OBS log files.

To read a log, open one with:

sh

Copy

cat

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/obs-*.txt | less

Look for 
streaming URLs or file save locations.

B. Check OBS Recording & Stream Settings

Open 
OBS Studio

Go to 
Settings → Output

Check:

Recording Path
 (Where videos were saved)

Streaming Service & Server
 (If it was broadcasting live)

Look for:

YouStream, Twitch, YouTube, RTMP URLs, or unknown servers.

C. Check OBS Profile & Scene Collection

OBS Studio → Scene Collection → Import

OBS Studio → Profile → Import

Look for 
suspicious profiles
 that may have been set up for streaming.

2️⃣ Find Where the Videos Were Stored

If OBS was saving recordings, find them:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f -n
