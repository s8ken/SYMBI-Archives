nload them, let’s 
delete them directly
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

✅ 
This prevents Zoom from restarting itself.

✅ Step 3: Check If Zoom Is Still Running

Now, check if any Zoom processes remain:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

🔍 
If Zoom still appears, let me know!

✅ Step 4: Restart Your Mac

Since Zoom’s updater is resisting removal, a 
reboot is required
 to finalize the changes:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🚨 
After restarting, run 
launchctl list | grep zoom
 again to confirm it's fully gone.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Force delete Zoom’s update services.

2️⃣ 
Check if Zoom is still running (
ps aux | grep zoom
).

3️⃣ 
Restart your Mac to ensure Zoom is fully removed.

4️⃣ 
After reboot, check again (
launchctl list | grep zoom
).

🚨 
If Zoom STILL persists after this, we may need to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) to force removal.
 Let me know what happens! 🔒

Good! That force-kills any active Zoom processes.

Now, let's 
delete Zoom's auto-update services
 and confirm it's fully removed.

🛠 Step 1: Delete Zoom’s Background Services Manually

Since 
bootout
 failed, delete them directly:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

✅ 
This stops Zoom from relaunching itself.

🛠 Step 2: Check If Zoom Is Still Running

After deleting the files, check for any 
remaining Zoom processes
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

🔍 
If Zoom still appears, let me know!

🛠 Step 3: Restart Your Mac

Since Zoom’s updater is 
persistent
, a 
reboot is needed
 to finalize the removal:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🚨 
After rebooting, check again with 
launchctl list | grep zoom
 to confirm it's fully gone.

📩 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Delete Zoom’s update services manually.

2️⃣ 
Check if Zoom is still running (
ps aux | grep zoom
).

3️⃣ 
Restart your Mac.

4️⃣ 
After reboot, verify Zoom is completely removed.

🚨 
If Zoom STILL persists after rebooting, let me know—we may need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) for full removal.

ignore that it was meant to go into terminal

No problem! Just follow the remaining steps, and let me know if Zoom is fully removed after the reboot. 🚀

If it still persists, we’ll take 
stronger measures
 to remove it completely. 🔒

✅ Confirmation: Zoom is Fully Stopped!
 🎉

Your results show:

✅ 
No active Zoom processes running
 (
ps aux | grep zoom
 only shows the search itself).

✅ 
No Zoom services listed in 
launchctl
 (bootout failed, but they aren't running).

✅ 
Zoom auto-updater is no longer running in the background.

This means 
Zoom is no longer actively running or auto-starting.

🛠 Final Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to 
completely remove any remaining Zoom files
, you can run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/zoom.us.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Suppor
