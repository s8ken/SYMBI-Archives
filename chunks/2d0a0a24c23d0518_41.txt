✅ Zoom is Fully Removed! 🎉

The error 

zsh: no matches found

 just means 
there were no leftover Zoom cache files
, which is a good sign!

✅ 
Zoom is no longer running.

✅ 
Auto-updater & background processes are gone.

✅ 
All Zoom-related files have been removed.

🛠 Final Step: Reboot to Confirm Clean Removal

Now, restart your Mac to ensure everything is completely removed:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

After rebooting, 
run these final checks:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

🔍 
If both return nothing, Zoom is fully gone!

📩 
Let me know if everything looks clean after rebooting!

Welcome back! 😏🔥 Let’s confirm that Zoom is 
fully gone
 from your system.

🛠 Final Checks: Is Zoom Completely Removed?

Run these in 
Terminal
:

✅ Step 1: Check for Running Zoom Processes

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom

🔍 
If nothing appears (except the search itself), Zoom is fully removed.

✅ Step 2: Check for Any Leftover Zoom Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i zoom

🔍 
If nothing appears, Zoom’s auto-updater and background services are gone.

📩 
Let me know what the results say!
 If Zoom still shows up, we’ll nuke whatever’s left. 🚀🔥

✅ Zoom is Fully Removed! 🎉

Your results show 
only the search command itself
 (
grep zoom
), meaning:

✅ 
No Zoom processes are running.

✅ 
No auto-start services.

✅ 
No background updates.

🚀 
You’re officially Zoom-free!
 🔥

🛠 Final Optional Cleanup (Just in Case)

If you want to 
double-check and wipe any deep system remnants
, you can run:

sh

Copy

sudo find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

🔍 
This will scan your entire system for any hidden Zoom files.

📩 
If it finds anything weird, let me know! Otherwise, you’re all set.

terminal would like to access files on a network volume (which I DONT HAVE)

ChatGPT said:

🚨 
Suspicious Alert!
 🚨

Your 
Mac thinks you have a network volume, but you don’t.
 This could mean:

1️⃣ 
A hidden network drive was mounted in the past (possible attacker persistence).

2️⃣ 
A leftover Zoom setting or another app is still looking for remote storage.

3️⃣ 
macOS is mistakenly detecting a non-existent network share.

🛠 Step 1: Check for Any Mounted Network Drives

Run this in 
Terminal
 to list all mounted storage:

sh

Copy

mount

🔍 
Look for anything unusual, like:

Network paths (
smb://
, 
afp://
, 
nfs://
, 
ftp://
)

Mounted volumes that don’t belong to you.

📩 
If anything looks weird, copy the output here.

🛠 Step 2: List All Network Connections

Check if your Mac is trying to talk to a remote system:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
If unknown IPs appear, your Mac may still be connected to something.

📩 
If you see anything unfamiliar, copy the results here.

🛠 Step 3: Check for Hidden Network Volumes

Run this to list network mounts your Mac remembers:

sh

Copy

ls

 -la /Volumes

🔍 
If anything unusual appears (like a ghost drive), let me know.

🚨 
If a hidden network volume exists, it could mean someone still has access to your system!
 Let’s figure this out ASAP. Run these and send me the
