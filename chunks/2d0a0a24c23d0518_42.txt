❌ 
Do NOT Allow Terminal to Access a Network Volume!
 ❌

Since you 
don’t have a network volume
, this request is suspicious. Allowing it 
could give an unknown process access to external storage
 that might not even be yours.

🛠 Next Steps: Find Out What’s Causing This

Since 
Terminal is asking for network access
, let's check 
if something is trying to mount a network drive.

✅ Step 1: Check for Mounted Network Drives

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

mount

🔍 
What to Look For:

If you see 
smb://
, 
afp://
, 
nfs://
, or any external network path, something is mounting a network share.

If anything unusual appears, copy the results here.

✅ Step 2: Check Finder for Hidden Network Volumes

1️⃣ Open 
Finder

2️⃣ Click 
Go → Go to Folder…

3️⃣ Enter: 
/Volumes/
 and press 
Enter

4️⃣ 
Look for any unknown drives

📩 
If you see anything suspicious, let me know.

✅ Step 3: Check Network Connections

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any unknown IP addresses or active remote connections.

📩 
If you see anything weird, copy the results here.

🚨 What This Means

If you 
don’t have a network volume
, 
something is trying to access one.

It could be a leftover Zoom setting, an old share, or a hidden process.

We need to confirm if a remote system is still connected to your Mac.

🚫 Click "Deny" and let’s investigate!
 Run the above steps and tell me what you find. 🔒🔥

🚨 
Deny It!
 🚨

If 
Terminal is asking to access data from other apps
, something 
might be trying to scrape
 your personal information. 
Do NOT allow it
 until we investigate!

🛠 Next Steps: Find Out What’s Causing This

Since Terminal is requesting unusual permissions, let's 
check what triggered it
.

✅ Step 1: Check Running Terminal Processes

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see what’s active:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i terminal

🔍 
What to Look For:

If 
Terminal is running anything unexpected
 in the background.

Any suspicious 
commands or scripts running inside Terminal.

📩 
If anything weird appears, copy it here.

✅ Step 2: Check If a Script or Process Triggered the Request

Run this to see the 
last commands executed
:

sh

Copy

history

 | 

tail

 -20

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any commands that 
mention network volumes, remote access, or hidden files.

📩 
If anything looks off, let me know.

✅ Step 3: Check If Any Unknown Apps Are Requesting Access

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof | grep -i library

🔍 
What to Look For:

Any unexpected apps trying to access files in 
~/Library/
 (where app data is stored).

If Zoom or any unknown process is still running.

📩 
If something weird appears, copy the output here.

🚨 What This Means

If 
Terminal is requesting app data
, something might be trying to 
collect or access your personal info.

It could be a rogue process, a script, or leftover Zoom permissions.

We need to confirm what triggered it before allowing anything.

🚫 
Click "Deny" and run these checks!
 Let me know what you find. 🔒🔥

🚨 Key Findings from Your Zoom Cleanup Scan

Your scan results 
still show several Zoom-related files and services that need to be removed manually.

🛠 Next Steps: Delete Remaining Zoom Files

Since Zoom left behind 
logs, preferences, and hidden update files
, let’s fully delete them.

✅ Step 1: Remove Zoom's Hidden Updater Services

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/us.zoom.ZoomDaemon
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Application\ Support/ZoomUpdater
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Preferences/us.zoom.updater.plist

✅ 
Deletes Zoom’s background updater and hidden service files.

✅ Step 2: Remove Zoom Logs & Cache

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Logs/zoom.us
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Logs/ZoomPhone
sudo 

rm

 -rf
