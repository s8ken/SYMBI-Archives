 /Users/user/Library/Caches/us.zoom.xos

✅ 
Clears any remaining Zoom logs, which could contain stored data.

✅ Step 3: Remove Zoom Saved State & Config Files

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/us.zoom.xos.savedState
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Preferences/ZoomChat.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Group\ Containers/BJ4HAAB9B3.ZoomClient3rd

✅ 
Ensures Zoom cannot restore settings or reappear after a reboot.

🛠 Final Step: Confirm Everything is Gone

After running the above deletions, check if anything is still left:

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

🔍 
If it still finds Zoom files, let me know so we can force remove them.

🚨 
Once this is done, restart your Mac to finalize everything:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

📩 
Let me know how it goes!

Great! You’ve removed Zoom’s hidden updater services.

Now, let’s 
finish the cleanup
 and confirm Zoom is 
fully wiped out.

🛠 Step 1: Remove Any Remaining Zoom Logs & Cache

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/zoom.us
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/ZoomPhone
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/us.zoom.xos

✅ 
This clears all Zoom log files and cache.

🛠 Step 2: Remove Zoom Saved States & Configs

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/us.zoom.xos.savedState
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/ZoomChat.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/BJ4HAAB9B3.ZoomClient3rd

✅ 
Prevents Zoom from restoring any settings.

🛠 Step 3: Confirm Everything is Gone

Run this in 
Terminal
 to scan for any remaining Zoom files:

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

🔍 
If it still finds Zoom files, copy the results here, and we’ll force remove them.

🛠 Final Step: Restart Your Mac

Since Zoom had 
deep system integrations
, restart your Mac to finalize everything:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🚀 
After rebooting, check one last time:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

📩 
If both return nothing, Zoom is 100% gone. Let me know how it goes!

Zoom’s logs, cache, and saved data are now fully removed!

Now, let’s 
confirm everything is gone
 and make sure 
no hidden Zoom files remain.

🛠 Final Confirmation: Is Zoom Completely Removed?

Run this in 
Terminal
:

✅ Step 1: Check for Any Remaining Zoom Files

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

🔍 
If it returns nothing, Zoom is 100% gone!

📩 
If it finds files, copy the output here, and we’ll force delete them.

✅ Step 2: Check for Any Running Zoom Services

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

🔍 
If nothing appears (except the search itself), Zoom is fully removed.

✅ Step 3: Restart to Finalize Changes

Since Zoom had 
deep system integrations
, a reboot ensures everything is cleared:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🚀 
After rebooting, re-run the checks above to confirm Zoom is gone!
 Let me know the results. 🔒🔥

🚨 Key Findings: Some Zoom Files Are Still Left

Your scan 
mostly returned system-related "zoom" references
 (like macOS accessibility features), but I found a few 
real leftover Zoom files
 that need to be removed manually.

🛠 Step 1: Remove Remaining Zoom System Files

Run these in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/receipts/us.zoom.pkg.videomeeting.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/receipts/us.zoom.pkg.videomeeting.bom
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/folders/dn/sxvkp4s5229fnrnks7223pmr0000gr/C/us.zoom.xos

This deletes Zoom’s installer receipts & temp fil
