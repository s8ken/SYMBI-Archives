3️⃣ 

dmd: Requested application com.apple.loginwindow has policy OK
 (00:46:53)

This indicates 
some kind of management service validated the login window.

Possible Remote Device Management (MDM) activity.

4️⃣ 

kernel: process_is_plugin_host: running binary "login" in keys-off mode
 (00:52:10 & 00:55:00)

A process executed with security privileges, modifying login behavior.

Possible attacker persistence mechanism or remote session trigger.

🚨 What This Means

Something triggered repeated login-related activity in a very short time span.

There may have been an attempt to interfere with your session or forcibly log you out.

We need to check for MDM (remote management) or hidden login-related processes.

🛠 Next Steps: Find Out Who Triggered This

Since this behavior suggests 
forced logout or remote login interference
, let’s track the cause.

✅ Step 1: Check for Active MDM (Remote Management)

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see if 
MDM (Mobile Device Management) is enabled
:

sh

Copy

profiles status -

type

 enrollment

🔍 
If it says "Enrolled," your Mac is managed remotely.

📩 
Let me know the result.

✅ Step 2: Check for Active Remote Access Services

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement\|screensharing\|ssh"

🔍 
If anything appears, a remote service is still running.

📩 
Copy the output here so we can disable it.

✅ Step 3: Check for Recently Created Users

An attacker may have 
added a hidden user account
 to maintain access. Run:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

 | 

sort

🔍 
If you see any unknown usernames, let me know immediately!

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if your Mac is under remote control (
profiles status -type enrollment
).

2️⃣ 
Check if Remote Management, Screen Sharing, or SSH is still active.

3️⃣ 
List all user accounts to confirm no hidden accounts exist.

🚨 
If anything unusual appears, we’ll take immediate action to block it.
 Run these checks and tell me what you find! 🔒🔥

✅ No MDM (Remote Management) Detected!
 🎉

Your Mac 
is NOT enrolled in any remote management system (MDM),
 which means:

✅ 
No enterprise or attacker-controlled management profile is active.

✅ 
No forced remote configuration from an MDM server.

✅ 
Your system settings are not externally controlled.

🛠 Next Steps: Check for Other Hidden Remote Access

Since 
MDM is not active
, we need to confirm 
if any remote access services (Screen Sharing, SSH, Remote Desktop) are still running.

✅ Step 1: Check for Active Remote Services

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement\|screensharing\|ssh"

🔍 
What to Look For:

If nothing appears → Remote access is OFF.

If services appear → An attacker may still have access.

📩 
Copy the results here so we can shut them down if needed.

✅ Step 2: Check for Recently Created Hidden Users

If an attacker 
added a hidden user account
, this command will find it:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

 | 

sort

🔍 
What to Look For:

Your known accounts should be listed.

If there’s an unknown user, it could be an attacker’s backdoor.

📩 
Copy the results here if anything looks off!

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if Remote Access Services are running (
launchctl list | grep -i "remotemanagement"
)

2️⃣ 
Check for hidden user accounts (
dscl . list /Users | grep -v '^_'
).

🚨 
If anything looks suspicious, we’ll remove it immediately.
 Let me know what you find! 🔒🔥

Run that command in 
Terminal

🔍 
If nothing appears:

✅ 
No active remote access services
 → Your system is not currently being accessed remotely.

🚨 
If something does appear:

Copy the results here
, and we’ll disable any remaining remote acces
