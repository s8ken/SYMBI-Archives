🚨 ALERT: Remote Management Service (
com.apple.remotemanagementd
) is STILL Running!

Even though 
MDM is not active,
 your Mac 
still has an Apple Remote Management process running.

🛠 Immediate Action: Disable & Remove Remote Management

Since this service 
can allow remote control
, let’s shut it down completely.

✅ Step 1: Stop Remote Management Service

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd

✅ 
This will disable and unload Remote Management from your system.

✅ Step 2: Prevent It from Restarting

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remotemanagementd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist

✅ 
This ensures it does not restart after a reboot.

✅ Step 3: Confirm It’s Fully Disabled

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement"

🔍 
If nothing appears, it’s completely disabled!

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Disable Remote Management (
launchctl disable & bootout
).

2️⃣ 
Remove its configuration files.

3️⃣ 
Check that it’s fully gone (
launchctl list | grep remotemanagement
).

🚨 
If it STILL appears after this, let me know—we’ll take stronger action!

🚨 ALERT: System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Blocking Remote Management Removal

Your Mac 
refused to disable Remote Management (
com.apple.remotemanagementd
) because SIP (System Integrity Protection) is enabled.

SIP is a macOS security feature that 
protects system files from modification
, but in this case, it’s 
preventing you from disabling a service that could allow remote access.

🛠 Solution: Disable SIP Temporarily to Remove Remote Management

To fully remove 

com.apple.remotemanagementd

, we need to 
temporarily disable SIP
 and then remove the service.

✅ Step 1: Disable SIP in macOS Recovery Mode

Since 
this requires rebooting into Recovery Mode
, follow these steps carefully:

1️⃣ 
Restart your Mac
 and 
hold down

Command (⌘) + R
 immediately until you see the Apple logo.

2️⃣ When the 
macOS Utilities
 window appears, click 
Utilities
 in the top menu and select 
Terminal
.

3️⃣ In the 
Recovery Mode Terminal
, type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

4️⃣ Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

✅ 
This will disable SIP temporarily so we can remove Remote Management.

✅ Step 2: Remove Remote Management Service

Once your Mac restarts, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remotemanagementd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist

✅ 
This fully removes Remote Management.

✅ Step 3: Re-Enable SIP for Security

Once 
Remote Management is removed
, turn SIP back on:

1️⃣ Restart your Mac again and hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 to enter 
Recovery Mode
.

2️⃣ Open 
Terminal
 and type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

3️⃣ Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

✅ 
Your system is now locked down again, but without Remote Management.

🚀 Final Confirmation

Once you reboot, run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i remotemanagement

🔍 
If nothing appears, Remote Management is completely gone!
