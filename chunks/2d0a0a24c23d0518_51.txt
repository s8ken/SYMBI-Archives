Good move!
 Having a 
screen recording running
 will help capture 
any unexpected behavior or forced logouts.

Since we now have 
real-time monitoring
, we can:

1️⃣ 
Wait and observe
 if any strange windows appear again.

2️⃣ 
Check logs afterward
 to match suspicious activity to specific processes.

3️⃣ 
Use the footage as evidence
 if needed.

🚨 
If something unusual happens while recording, take note of the exact time
 so we can correlate it with logs. Let me know what you see! 🔒🔥

ok cool - I think we should also remove chrome

Updated saved memory

✅ 
Good call!
 Since Chrome was actively involved during the attack, removing it eliminates a 
major potential entry point.

🛠 Step 1: Fully Uninstall Google Chrome

Run these commands in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.google.Chrome
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.google.Chrome.savedState

✅ 
This removes Chrome and all stored data, including extensions.

🛠 Step 2: Check for Chrome Background Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep chrome

🔍 
If anything appears, we’ll force-kill lingering Chrome services.

🛠 Step 3: Remove Chrome Auto-Updater

Google installs an 
auto-update agent
 that keeps running even after Chrome is removed. Remove it with:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Google
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Google

✅ 
This prevents Chrome from reinstalling itself in the background.

🛠 Step 4: Restart Your Mac to Finalize Removal

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🚨 
After rebooting, run this to confirm Chrome is completely gone:

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*chrome*"

 2>/dev/null

📩 
If anything still appears, we’ll force-delete it.
 Let me know how it goes! 🔒🔥

🚨 Chrome Is Still Running in the Background!

Even after uninstalling, 
Chrome's crash handler (
chrome_crashpad_handler
) is still active.
 This means:

Google’s crash reporting is still running

Chrome’s auto-update process may still be active

🛠 Step 1: Force Kill Chrome’s Background Process

Run this in 
Terminal
 to stop the running Chrome process:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill -9 chrome_crashpad_handler

✅ 
This force-stops any lingering Chrome services.

🛠 Step 2: Remove the Chrome Crashpad Folder

Since it’s still trying to run, delete its crash report files:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Crashpad

✅ 
This prevents Chrome from trying to restart its reporting process.

🛠 Step 3: Confirm Chrome Is Fully Gone

Run this one last time:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep chrome

🔍 
If nothing appears, Chrome
