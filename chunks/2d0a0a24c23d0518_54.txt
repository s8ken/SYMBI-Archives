After logging into 
Safe Mode
, open 
Terminal
 and check:

✅ 
1. Are there any hidden user accounts?

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

🔍 
Look for unknown accounts
 (if an attacker created a hidden user, we’ll remove it).

✅ 
2. Is Remote Access still running?

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement\|screensharing\|ssh"

🔍 
If remote management is back, we’ll investigate how it’s restarting.

✅ 
3. Is an unknown network device connected?

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
If unknown IPs appear, something is still controlling your Mac externally.

📩 
Let me know what these checks show after booting into Safe Mode!

Got it! Boot into 
Safe Mode
, run the checks, and let me know what you find. I’ll be here when you’re back. 🔒🔥

You said:

ok I am back and I selected safe mode but am unsure I am in safe mode as the clock time is not red 

ChatGPT said:

Good observation! On 
M1/M2 Macs,
 Safe Mode 
does not
 turn the clock red like older Intel Macs.

🛠 How to Confirm You’re in Safe Mode

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType | grep 

"Boot Mode"

🔍 
If it says:

✅ 
"Safe"
 → You’re in Safe Mode.

❌ 
"Normal"
 → You need to try again.

📩 
Let me know what it says!
 If you’re not in Safe Mode, we’ll try again with a different method. 🔒🔥

cool we are in safe

ChatGPT said:

✅ 
Great! Now that we’re in Safe Mode, let’s investigate what’s still running.

🛠 Step 1: Check for Hidden User Accounts

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

🔍 
Look for any unknown accounts
 that could be used for persistence.

📩 
Copy the results here.

🛠 Step 2: Check for Remote Access Services

Even in Safe Mode, some backdoors might still be running. Run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement\|screensharing\|ssh"

🔍 
If anything appears, the attacker still has a way in.

📩 
Copy the results so we can remove anything suspicious.

🛠 Step 3: Check for Active Network Connections

To see if your Mac is still talking to an external attacker, run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

🔍 
If unknown IPs appear, we’ll trace them back.

📩 
Send me the results, and we’ll take the next step! 🔒🔥

🚨 Suspicious User Accounts Found!

Your 
Mac should NOT have "djlcl" or "m" as user accounts.

✅ 
Legitimate Accounts:

root
 → The main system administrator.

daemon
 → Normal system process user.

nobody
 → Standard non-privileged system account.

user
 → Your main user account (assuming this is your normal login).

🚨 
Potentially Malicious or Unauthorized Accounts:

djlcl

 → Unknown, possibly attacker-created.

m

 → Very unusual, possibly a hidden backdoor account.

🛠 Step 1: Check If These Users Have a Home Directory

Run this to see if these accounts have active home folders:

sh

Copy

ls

 -la /Users/

🔍 
If 
djlcl
 or 
m
 have a folder here, they may have been used for persistence.

📩 
Send me the results!

🛠 Step 2: Check If These Users Have Administrator Privileges

Run this to check if 
they have admin access
:

sh

Copy

dscl . -

read

 /Users/djlcl | grep -i 

"admin"

dscl . -

read

 /Users/m | grep -i 

"admin"

🔍 
If they have admin rights, the attacker could still control your Mac!

📩 
Tell me what shows up!

🛠 Step 3: Check If These Users Are Logged In

Run:

sh

Copy

who

🔍 
If 
djlcl
 or 
m
 appear, they are currently active!

📩 
If they are logged in, we will immediately remove them.

🚨 
Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check if they have home directories (
ls -la /Users/
).

2️⃣ 
Check if they have admin access (
dscl . -read /Users/[username]
).

3️⃣ 
Check if they are actively logged in (
who
).

📩 
Send me the results ASAP so we can kick them out and remove them! 🔥🔒
