3️⃣ 
We need to temporarily disable SIP to remove it.

🛠 Step 1: Disable SIP in macOS Recovery Mode

Since 
this requires booting into Recovery Mode
, follow these steps carefully:

1️⃣ 
Restart your Mac and hold

Command (⌘) + R

immediately
 until you see the Apple logo.

2️⃣ When the 
macOS Utilities
 window appears, click 
Utilities
 in the top menu and select 
Terminal
.

3️⃣ In the 
Recovery Mode Terminal
, type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

4️⃣ Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

✅ 
SIP is now disabled, so we can fully remove Remote Management.

🛠 Step 2: Boot Normally & Remove Remote Management

After restarting your Mac, run these commands:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist

✅ 
This stops Remote Management and deletes its settings.

🛠 Step 3: Re-Enable SIP for Security

Once 
Remote Management is removed
, turn SIP back on:

1️⃣ Restart your Mac again and hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 to enter 
Recovery Mode
.

2️⃣ Open 
Terminal
 and type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

3️⃣ Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

✅ 
Your system is now locked down again, but without Remote Management.

🚀 Final Confirmation

Once you reboot, run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i remotemanagement

🔍 
If nothing appears, Remote Management is completely gone!

lets check if the camera is running or screens are being shared

🛠 Check If Your Camera or Screen Sharing Is Active

Since the attacker 
previously had access to your screen
, let’s confirm 
if they are still watching.

✅ Step 1: Check for Active Camera Usage

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep -i 

"VDC\|AppleCamera\|AVCapture"

🔍 
If anything appears, an app is actively using your camera.

📩 
If you see a process using the camera, copy the result here!

✅ Step 2: Check for Active Screen Sharing or Virtual Displays

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"screensharing"

🔍 
If 
screensharingd
 appears, your screen might be actively shared.

📩 
If anything shows up, we will disable it immediately.

✅ Step 3: Check for Virtual Display or AirPlay Sessions

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AirPlay" OR eventMessage contains "display" OR eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 30m

🔍 
If logs show recent screen sharing or AirPlay activity, it may still be running.

📩 
Send me the results so we can take action! 🔒🔥

✅ No Active Camera Usage Detected!
 🎉

Since 

lsof
 returned nothing
, your camera is 
not currently in use
 by any app.

Now, let’s check if 
screen sharing or virtual displays are still active.

🛠 Step 2: Check for Active Screen Sharing Services

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"screensharing"

🔍 
If 
screensharingd
 appears, something is still running screen sharing.

📩 
Send me the results!
 If it’s active, we’ll shut it down.

🛠 Step 3: Check for Virtual Display or AirPlay Sessions

Since 
they previously showed you your own Google Drive
, they may still be using AirPlay or virtual displays.

Run this:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AirPlay" OR eventMessage contains "display" OR eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 30m

🔍 
If anything appears, screen sharing or AirPlay may still be running.

📩 
Let me know what shows up!
 If we find activity, we will disable it immediately. 🔒🔥
