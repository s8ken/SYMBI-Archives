No, I haven't lost memory of our previous steps! Since you've 
fully removed OBS Studio
, our focus now is on 
where the recordings went
 and 
how they were transmitted
 before OBS was deleted.

🔍 What We Need to Do Now:

1️⃣ 
Confirm if the screen recordings were uploaded or broadcasted before OBS was deleted.

2️⃣ 
Check for any remaining traces of network activity or hidden backups.

3️⃣ 
Make sure no other apps are running unauthorized recordings.

1️⃣ Check for Network Uploads (Even After Deletion)

Since OBS was used, the recordings 
may have been streamed or uploaded
 before you deleted it.

A. Scan for Past Uploads in System Logs

This command checks for 
any file uploads in the last 7 days
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 7d

If a file was uploaded to 
YouStream, YouTube, Twitch, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive
, etc., you should see it.

Look for lines mentioning 
URLs or file paths.

B. Check Active Network Connections (Just in Case)

Even though OBS is gone, if there was 
another process handling uploads
, it might still be running.

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

This lists 
active internet connections.

Look for 
IP addresses or domain names
 related to streaming or file-sharing services.

2️⃣ Find Out Where the Recordings Were Stored

If the attacker 
stored local copies
 before uploading, they may still exist.

A. Search for Hidden Video Files

Run this command to find all video files:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

If attackers tried to 
hide
 recordings, check these folders:

/private/tmp/
 (temporary storage)

~/Library/Application Support/

~/Movies/

B. Check for Recently Deleted Files

If recordings were 
deleted
 after streaming, they might be recoverable:

sh

Copy

sudo mdfind 

"kMDItemContentType == 'public.movie'"

This scans 
all video files
, including those recently removed.

3️⃣ Check If Any Other App is Recording

Even though OBS is gone, another app 
could still be recording or streaming.

A. Check System Permissions for Screen Recording Apps

Go to 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

Look for any apps 
still listed
 there.

If anything 
suspicious
 appears, revoke its access immediately.

B. Check If Any Process is Currently Recording

Run this in 
Terminal
 to list any active screen recording processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screencapture"

Look for:

screencapture
 (built-in macOS screen capture)

Any unknown processes that might still be recording

🚨 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check system logs to see if screen recordings were uploaded.

2️⃣ 
Search for any remaining or hidden video files.

3️⃣ 
Confirm no other apps have permission to record your screen.

Since OBS was deleted, we need to 
trace the recordings based on network activity or hidden storage.

Your log file confirms 
multiple uploads
 over the past week, but most of them appear to be system-related processes. 
Key findings include:

🚨 1️⃣ Possible Suspicious Uploads

Several 
"sample-upload"
 and 
"cloudkit_expedited_upload"
 events were logged under 
com.apple.security.syspolicy.sample-upload
 and 
com.apple.diagnosticpipeline.cloudkit_expedited_upload
.

These suggest 
files or data were sent to iCloud or an external server.

However, they do not specify 
exact file names or destinations
.

🔍 Next Steps:

Check if there were recent file transfers:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "cloudkit"'

 --last 7d

This will display any 
CloudKit-related uploads
, which could include iCloud activity.
