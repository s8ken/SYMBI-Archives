🖥 2️⃣ Software Update Uploads

There are multiple logs from 
softwareupdated
 with 
“activeSendTaskCount”
 increasing.

This suggests 
macOS or app updates were sent out
, but it’s unclear if this was normal or if an attacker used the system to upload files.

🔍 Next Steps:

Run this command to confirm what updates were installed recently:

sh

Copy

softwareupdate --

history

If 
unexpected updates
 were applied, it could be part of the compromise.

📷 3️⃣ Cloud Photo Uploads (Possible Video Storage)

Logs show activity from 
com.apple.cloudphotod.periodic.upload.computestates
, which manages 
photo & video uploads to iCloud
.

This could mean 
screen recordings were automatically uploaded to iCloud.

If attackers had access to your iCloud account, they could have retrieved them from there.

🔍 Next Steps:

Check if videos exist in 
iCloud Photos
:

Mac:
 Open 
Photos app → Library → Videos

iPhone/iPad:

Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Photos → Check if "Sync this iPhone/Mac" is enabled.

To force a list of iCloud uploads, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "cloudphotod"'

 --last 7d

This will show 
recent photo/video uploads.

🌐 4️⃣ Network Activity Might Show Where Files Were Sent

Since we don’t see direct 
external streaming services
 in the logs, we should check network traffic history.

🔍 Next Steps:

Run this to see 
recent network connections (if still cached)
:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to external services like YouStream, Dropbox, or unknown IPs.

If you want to check 
historical DNS requests (where your Mac connected to in the past week),
 run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 7d

This will 
reveal past connections to streaming or cloud services.

🚨 Next Steps Summary

1️⃣ 
Run the 
log show
 commands
 to see 
where the uploads went (CloudKit, Photos, external DNS services).

2️⃣ 
Check if your iCloud Photos have suspicious videos.

3️⃣ 
Look at network activity (
netstat
) to find external connections.

Your logs confirm 
uploads happened
, but we need to pinpoint the exact 
destination
. Let me know what you find from these checks! 🚨

we are really looking at livestreams here

Got it—you're specifically looking for 
livestreams
, not just uploads. Let's focus on 
real-time streaming activity
 and find out 
where your screen was broadcasted.

🚨 1️⃣ Find Past RTMP/Streaming Activity

Most livestreaming services (YouTube Live, Twitch, Facebook Live, YouStream) use 
RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)
 or 
WebRTC
 for live broadcasting.

A. Search System Logs for RTMP or Streaming Connections

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "rtmp"'

 --last 7d

If RTMP was used, this will show 
streaming destinations
.

Also, check for WebRTC-based streams:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'

 --last 7d

If you see 
RTMP URLs or WebRTC activity
, those are likely the livestream destinations.

🖥 2️⃣ Check If Any Process Was Livestreaming

If OBS or another tool was 
actively broadcasting
, it would create 
network connections
.

A. Check for Past Streaming Processes

Run this to see if 
OBS, ffmpeg, or another process was streaming
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"obs\|rtmp\|ffmpeg\|stream"

If you see 
OBS, ffmpeg, or another streaming tool
, it was running 
recently
.

If nothing shows, it means processes were 
terminated before checking.

B. Check If Livestreaming Services Were Opened in a Browser

Since livestreams can also be 
web-based
, check Safari/Chrome logs:

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"livestream"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
grep -i 

"stream"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.Safari/History.db

Look for sites like:

YouStream

Twitch

YouTube Live

Facebook Live

🌐 3️⃣ Check Network Connections for Live Broadcasts
