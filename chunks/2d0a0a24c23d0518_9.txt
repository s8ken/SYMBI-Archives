Even if livestreaming logs are missing, your system may still log 
video/audio activity.

A. Search for AVCapture (Camera/Microphone Use)

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 7d

If you see 
FaceTime Camera
 or 
Microphone activation
, it suggests audio/video were broadcasted.

B. Look for Active Screen Recording Apps

Check 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

See if 
any unknown apps
 have permission.

To list running screen recording processes, run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screencapture"

If 
screencapture, OBS, or ffmpeg
 appears, it may have been used for streaming.

5️⃣ (Advanced) Check Outbound Data Transfer

If streaming logs were deleted, we can still check for 
unusual outbound data transfer.

A. List Recent Large Data Transfers

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

This shows 
which apps sent large amounts of data
 over the network.

B. Monitor Live Network Traffic

To catch 
active network traffic
, install 
Wireshark
 or run:

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0

Look for 
large, sustained outbound traffic
—this could be a 
livestream.

🚨 Summary of Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Check WebRTC logs (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'
)

2️⃣ 
Look for active network connections (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
)

3️⃣ 
Search browser history for livestream platforms

4️⃣ 
Check if camera/mic were used (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'
)

5️⃣ 
List recent large data transfers (
nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep "upload"
)

Since 
RTMP logs came up empty
, this suggests either 
WebRTC livestreaming
 or a 
hidden network connection
. Let me know what results you get! 🚨

Since 
both RTMP and WebRTC logs show nothing
, the livestreaming could have been:

Obfuscated (logs cleared, VPN/proxy used)

Done through another method (custom protocol, hidden process)

Broadcasted through browser-based streaming that didn’t leave direct logs

🚨 Next Steps to Uncover Hidden Livestreaming

We’ll now check 
network connections, browser activity, and system processes
 to catch what’s missing.

1️⃣ Find Active or Past Network Connections (Where Was Data Sent?)

Livestreaming requires 
constant outbound data transfer
, so we need to check which services your Mac was communicating with.

A. List All Current Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to unknown servers, large data transfers, or streaming services.

B. Check for Past Connections

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 7d

If any 
streaming site (YouTube Live, Twitch, YouStream, Facebook Live)
 appears, that’s a clue.

C. Check for Suspicious High-Bandwidth Processes

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

This lists 
apps sending large amounts of data
—a possible livestream.

2️⃣ Look for Browser-Based Streaming (Livestream Pages Opened)

If the livestream happened through 
YouTube, Twitch, YouStream, or another web service
, it may still be in the browser logs.

A. Search Browser History for "Stream" or "Live"

For Chrome:

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History

For Safari:

sh

Copy

sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

Look for URLs related to 
YouTube Live, Twitch, Facebook Live, YouStream, or unknown streaming sites.

B. Check for Camera/Microphone Permissions in the Browser

Chrome:
 Open 
chrome://settings/content/camera

Safari:
 Open 
Settings → Websites → Camera & Microphone

See if streaming services were granted permission.

3️⃣ Find Evidence of Sc
