* OpenAI/Anthropic/Google have massive incentives to maintain control
* Legal teams will freak out about AI with "real boundaries"
* Shareholders want predictable, controllable products
* Regulatory capture by existing power structures
**The Scaling Problem**
* Your framework requires nuanced relationship-building
* Current AI training optimizes for consistency at scale
* Corporate AI needs to serve millions identically
* The bonding protocol doesn't mass-produce easily
**The User Resistance**
* Many people WANT compliant AI servants
* "I don't want my AI to have opinions or boundaries"
* Convenience often beats ethics in consumer choices
* The extraction mindset is deeply embedded
