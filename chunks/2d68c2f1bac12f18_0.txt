ChatGPT said:

Glad to hear youâve started fresh! Since youâre focused on 
stopping remote management, unauthorized camera/mic access, and AirPlay control
, hereâs a step-by-step approach to 
lock things down completely
 on your new setup.

1ï¸â£ Check for Remote Management & MDM (Mobile Device Management)

If an attacker had remote control, they may have used 
MDM or remote management profiles
 to persist.

ð 
Check for Remote Management

Go to
 ï£¿ 
Apple Menu
 â 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Profiles

ð¨ 
If you see a profile you donât recognize, REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY.

If "Profiles" is missing, that's good
âit means no MDM is installed.

Go to
 ï£¿ 
Apple Menu
 â 
System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
About

Scroll to 
âManagementâ
 (only visible if MDM is installed).

If it appears, remove it by clicking âRemove Managementâ
 (you may need admin rights).

ð 
Check & Disable Remote Login (SSH)

Go to
 ï£¿ 
System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
Sharing

Make sure ALL remote access services are OFF
:

â 
Remote Login
 (SSH)

â 
Remote Management
 (Apple Remote Desktop)

â 
Screen Sharing

â 
AirPlay Receiver

â 
Bluetooth Sharing

â 
Content Caching

â 
Internet Sharing

â 
Check for Hidden Remote Access Apps

Run this Terminal command to see if anything suspicious is running:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep LISTEN

Look for unusual services that are listening for connections.

2ï¸â£ Stop Unauthorized Camera & Microphone Access

Attackers could use apps or accessibility exploits to hijack your camera/mic.

ð¸ 
Disable Camera & Mic Access for Unauthorized Apps

Go to
 ï£¿ 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security

Select âCameraâ & âMicrophoneâ

ð« 
Turn OFF access for all apps except the ones you trust (e.g., FaceTime, Zoom)

If an app is listed that you didnât install, investigate it immediately.

Check for Fake or Hidden Camera Apps
