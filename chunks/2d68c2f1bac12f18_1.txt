is command in Terminal to list apps that have requested camera/mic access:

bash

Copy

tccutil reset Camera
tccutil reset Microphone

This will reset permissions, forcing apps to request access againâ
if something re-enables itself without asking, itâs suspicious.

3ï¸â£ Stop Unauthorized AirPlay / Screen Mirroring

Since you suspected AirPlay was used in the past, letâs 
fully lock it down
.

ð¥ï¸ 
Turn Off AirPlay & Screen Mirroring

Go to
 ï£¿ 
System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
AirDrop & Handoff

Set "AirDrop" to âReceiving Offâ

Turn OFF "Allow Handoff"

Go to "AirPlay & Receiver"

Set 
"Allow AirPlay"
 to 
OFF

If you must keep it on, set it to 
âOnly People Sharing This Macâ

ð 
Check for Unauthorized AirPlay Devices

Go to
 ï£¿ 
System Settings
 â 
Control Center

Look under âScreen Mirroringâ
 â If you see any devices 
you donât recognize
, remove them.

4ï¸â£ Extra Steps to Ensure No Hidden Monitoring

â 
Check Accessibility Settings
 (Attackers may use these for remote control)

Go to
 ï£¿ 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Accessibility

Remove ALL apps unless you installed them yourself.

â 
Run a Quick Malware Scan
 (Check for persistence)

bash

Copy

sudo system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType | grep -i 

"remote"

This lists apps that contain "remote" in their name or description.

â 
Check Login Items & Background Services

Go to
 ï£¿ 
System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
Login Items

Disable any unknown items.

Run this command in Terminal:

bash

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i remote

If anything suspicious appears, let me know.

Final Step: Reboot & Monitor for Suspicious Behavior

Restart your Mac and check if 
any settings re-enable themselves

If anything 
turns back on automatically
, it could indicate a deeper issue.
