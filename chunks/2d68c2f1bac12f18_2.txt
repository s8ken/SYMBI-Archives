oximity features (like AirDrop & Handoff), you can disable it if you donât need those:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

Then restart your Mac.

3ï¸â£ Check for Hidden Remote Services

Run this command to check for unknown remote access tools:

bash

Copy

sudo netstat -anp tcp | grep LISTEN

Look for anything unusual listening on non-standard ports.

Final Questions for You

Do you recognize 
Disk\x20D
?

If not, we may need to check its source.

Do you use Android development tools?

If not, 
adb
 shouldnât be running.

Are you experiencing 
any strange behavior after rebooting
?

If anything reappears after killing it, it could be a sign of persistence.

Let me know what you find! ð

You Successfully Killed 
adb
, but It Might Restart

The process was running (
adb -L tcp:5037 fork-server server --reply-fd 4
), meaning 
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) was active
.

You 
successfully killed it
, but we need to 
make sure it doesnât come back
.

1ï¸â£ Unload 
adb
 Properly

Since 
launchctl unload
 gave an 
Input/output error
, try the alternative command:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.android.adb.plist

If it says 
"No such process"
, that means 
adb
 isnât set to restart.

2ï¸â£ Check If 
adb
 Reappears After a Reboot

To be 
100% sure it's gone
, restart your Mac and run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep adb

If 
it comes back
, it may be hiding in another location. In that case, try:

bash

Copy

sudo find / -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

ð¨ 
If 
adb
 is found somewhere unexpected, we need to manually delete it.

Quick Question: Did You Install Any Android-Related Software?

If 
you didnât install
 anything related to Android (like Bluestacks, Android Studio, etc.), 
adb
 being active 
is suspicious
 and we should dig deeper.

If 
you did install
 something, but you don't need 
adb
, we can 
fully remove it
.

Let me know what you find! ð

adb
 Might Be PersistingâLetâs Fully Remove It

Since 
launchctl bootout
 also failed, 
adb
 might be 
installed incorrectly
 or 
persisting through another method
. Let's fully remove it.

1ï¸â£ Find Where 
adb
 Is Installed

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo find / -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

This will show 
all locations
 where 
adb
 exists. Let me know what it returns.

2ï¸â£ Manually Delete 
adb

If 
find
 shows paths like:

/usr/local/bin/adb

/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb

/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.android.adb.plist

Remove them with:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /path/to/adb

(Replace 
/path/to/adb
 with the actual path from 
find
.)

Then remove its launch agent:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.android.adb.plist

3ï¸â£ Restart & Confirm Removal

Restart your Mac

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep adb

If 
nothing appears
, 
adb
 is gone. â

If it 
comes back
, we need deeper cleanup.

Quick Question:
 Did You Install Any Android-Related Software?

If not, 
adb
 being installed is 
very suspicious
âit could be part of unauthorized remote access.

If yes, but you 
donât need it
, weâll still fully remove it.

Let me know what 
find
 returns! ð
