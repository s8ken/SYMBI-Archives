ould 
not
 need access to your HDD or Photos just to search for 
adb
.

This suggests 
one of two things
:

Your system has extra security (like macOS Privacy Protections),
 and itâs just asking for permission. â

A malicious process is intercepting Terminal requests
 to gain extra access. ð¨

ð Next Steps:

1ï¸â£ Deny the Request for Now

If you 
donât recognize this behavior
, 
click "Deny"
 when macOS asks for access.

If it keeps asking, let me know.

2ï¸â£ Run a Limited 
find
 Instead

Since full disk access triggered the prompt, try searching specific safe locations:

bash

Copy

sudo find /usr /Library /System -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

If 
adb
 is installed somewhere suspicious, it should still appear.

3ï¸â£ Check If Anything Else Has Full Disk Access

Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Full Disk Access

Look for any 
unexpected apps with access
 (especially anything unknown).

Let me know if you see anything unusual.

â Questions

Did Terminal ever ask for disk access before?

Do you recognize any suspicious apps in Full Disk Access?

Have you noticed any other odd permissions requests?

Let me know what you find! ð

You said:

can we double check what permissions it has granted before we go any further?

ChatGPT said:

Yes! Letâs 
double-check Terminalâs permissions
 before proceeding.

ð 1ï¸â£ Check Terminal's Permissions in macOS Settings

Go to
:

System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Full Disk Access

Look for "Terminal"
 in the list.

If itâs enabled
, it means Terminal already has full access.

If itâs disabled
, macOS is asking because it needs extra access.

ð¹ Question:
 Is Terminal already listed here? If yes, is it toggled 
on or off
?

ð 2ï¸â£ Check Other Permissions (Camera, Microphone, etc.)

Since you mentioned 
unexpected permission prompts
, check:

System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â

Files & Folders
 â Look for Terminal

Photos
 â Look for Terminal

Camera & Microphone
 â Look for anything unusual

Screen Recording
 â Ensure only trusted apps are listed

ð¹ Question:
 Do you see anything strange, like apps you didnât approve?

ð 3ï¸â£ Check if Terminal Was Recently Granted Permissions

To see if Terminal (or any other app) was 
just granted access
, check system logs:

Run this command to check recent permissions granted:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.TCC"'

 --info --last 1h

This will list any 
permissions granted in the last hour
.

Look for Terminal, adb, or anything unexpected.

Next Steps Based on What You Find

If Terminal already has full disk access
 â We can proceed safely. â

If Terminal does NOT have access, but macOS keeps asking
 â Possible interference. ð¨

If you see unknown apps with permissions
 â We might need to revoke them.

Let me know what you find! ð

yep terminal was there to I clicked the - button

ChatGPT said:

Good call! 
Removing Terminal from Full Disk Access means it no longer has unrestricted access.
 Now, let's proceed carefully.

ð Next Steps

1ï¸â£ Retry Searching for 
adb
 (With Limited Scope)

Now that Terminal has 
no extra permissions
, letâs try a more 
restricted search
 that wonât trigger system prompts:

bash

Copy

sudo find /usr /Library /System -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

This avoids searching your personal files and sticks to system locations.

Let me know 
if 
adb
 shows up anywhere.

2ï¸â£ Check If Anything Else Has Full Disk Access

Now that we removed Terminal, letâs 
double-check for suspicious apps
:

Go to:

System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Full Disk Access

Look for any 
unknown or suspicious apps
.

Expected apps
: Time Machine, security software, disk utilities.

Unexpected apps
: Anything you donât remember allowing.
