Screen Recording
 â Anything unknown?

Camera & Microphone
 â Any suspicious apps?

Files & Folders
 â Look for Terminal, unexpected apps.

Accessibility

 Did any strange apps have permissions here?

We manually remove it.

If itâs 
hidden in an odd location
, this could mean something 
was reinstalled without your consent

Letâs review the results before deleting anything.

Thatâs very concerning.
 Terminal should 
not
 be trying to access files on a 
network volume
 unless:

You have manually connected to a network drive. â

Something suspicious is running in the background. ð¨

This could indicate:

A remote management tool is still active.

A hidden user process is accessing shared storage.

An unauthorized network mount (e.g., attacker-controlled drive).

ð Immediate Next Steps

1ï¸â£ Check If You Have Any Network Drives Mounted

Run:

bash

Copy

mount

If you see 
unexpected network drives (like SMB, NFS, or AFP mounts)
, we need to unmount them.

Let me know what shows up.

2ï¸â£ List All Active Network Connections

Run:

bash

Copy

netstat -rn

Look for 
unusual IP addresses
 or 
unexpected network routes.

3ï¸â£ Check for Unauthorized Remote Access

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote

This will show 
any remote management services.

Also, check for 
active sharing services
:

bash

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
sudo systemsetup -getremotemanagement

If 
any of these say "On,"
 we need to disable them.

4ï¸â£ Unmount Any Suspicious Network Drives

If you find an unknown network drive, unmount it:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /path/to/mount

Replace 
/path/to/mount
 with what 
mount
 showed.

ð¨ 
Key Questions:

Do you 
recognize any mounted network drives?

Does 
netstat -rn
 show any 
unknown IPs
?

Do the 
remote management checks show "On"?

Let me know what you find! ð

Immediate Concern: Suspicious NFS Mount (
.DDPreviewDisk
)
 ð¨

This line stands out:

bash

Copy

.DDPreviewDisk on /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk (nfs, nodev, nosuid, synchronous, mounted by lcl)

.DDPreviewDisk
 is mounted via NFS (Network File System)
 â This suggests 
a remote storage volume is attached
.

Itâs in 

/Users/lcl/.DDPreview/

, which is 
a hidden directory
âthis is highly unusual.

You didnât manually mount this, correct?
 If not, it 
could be an unauthorized remote volume.

ð¨ Immediate Next Steps

1ï¸â£ Unmount 
.DDPreviewDisk
 (If You Didn't Intentionally Mount It)

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

This will 
forcefully unmount
 the suspicious volume.

2ï¸â£ Check If It Reappears After Reboot

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo rebo
