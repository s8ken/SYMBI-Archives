After rebooting, run 
mount
 again to 
see if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 comes back.

If it 
remounts itself,
 something is 
reinstalling it automatically.

3ï¸â£ Find Out What Mounted It

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep DDPreview

This will show 
what process created 
.DDPreviewDisk
.

If you see a 
suspicious app or process
, let me know.

4ï¸â£ List All Network Volumes

Run:

bash

Copy

showmount -e localhost

This lists 
NFS shares on your Mac.

Let me know 
if any unexpected shares appear.

5ï¸â£ Check Launch Agents & Daemons (Persistence Mechanisms)

To see if something 
automatically mounts 
.DDPreviewDisk
 on startup
, check:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

ð¨ Look for 
files related to DDPreview, NFS, or anything suspicious.

ð Questions for You:

Did you manually set up an NFS share called 
.DDPreviewDisk
?

Did you recently install any software related to remote file access or previews?

Have you noticed files being accessed remotely or strange network activity?

ð¨ If you 
didnât
 set this up, this could be an 
active persistence mechanism
 keeping an external connection open. Let me know what you find! ð

You said:

ok so I installed a program called drill disk 

ChatGPT said:

Ah, that makes sense! 
Disk Drill
 is a data recovery tool, and it likely created 
.DDPreviewDisk
 as a virtual preview disk for file recovery.

Since 
Disk Drill has access to deep system files and disk volumes
, itâs important to verify that:

It isnât running anything unnecessary in the background.

It isnât creating unintended remote access points.

ð Next Steps

1ï¸â£ Check If Disk Drill Is Running in the Background

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep drill

If you see processes related to 
Disk Drill
, note their 
process IDs (PIDs)
 and stop them:

bash

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

2ï¸â£ Fully Uninstall Disk Drill (If You Donât Need It)

If you installed Disk Drill just for testing and donât plan to use it, remove it completely:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Disk\ Drill.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/CleverFiles
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.cleverfiles.DiskDrill.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Extensions/DiskDrill.kext

Then, 
check if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 disappears
 using 
mount
.

3ï¸â£ Ensure Disk Drill Isn't Auto-Mounting Disks on Startup

Check for any 
launch agents or daemons
 related to Disk Drill:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

If any files are found, 
remove them
:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /path/to/suspicious/file.plist

4ï¸â£ Confirm If 
.DDPreviewDisk
 Still Exists After Reboot

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo reboot

After rebooting, check 
mount
 again. If the 
network volume is still there, something else is causing it
.

Should You Keep Disk Drill?

If you 
needed it for data recovery,
 itâs fineâbut disable unnecessary background services.

If you 
no longer need it
, removing it 
fully
 is safest.

ð Let me know what you decide and if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 disappears after uninstalling or stopping Disk Drill!

You said:

yes I wanted to see how 'formatted' the drive actually was

ChatGPT said:

Got it! That makes senseâ
Disk Drill
 is useful for exploring formatted drives and attempting to recover lost files.

Next Steps:

1ï¸â£ After Uninstalling Disk Drill

If you're done with 
Disk Drill
 and no longer need to preview a drive, 
uninstalling
 as I mentioned earlier is a good idea for security and stability.

This will also help ensure that 
no hidden network mounts
 like 
.DDPreviewDisk
 remain active.

2ï¸â£ Check the Drive Format

If you're just curious about how 
the drive is formatted
, you can 
check the format without running Disk Drill
 by using Disk Utility or the Terminal:

Open 
Disk Utility
 and select
