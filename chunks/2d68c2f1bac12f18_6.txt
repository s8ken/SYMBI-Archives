 the drive. You'll see the format type (e.g., 
APFS
, **HFS+, 
exFAT
).

Terminal
:

Run this command to list all connected disks:

bash

Copy

diskutil list

Find your drive in the list and check its 
format type
.

3ï¸â£ Remove 
.DDPreviewDisk
 if No Longer Needed

If youâve finished checking the drive and no longer need it mounted:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

Then check if the mount is removed after rebooting.

Security Tip:

Once youâre done, itâs always good practice to 
reset permissions
 on any sensitive drives or files to prevent unauthorized access. Disk Drill shouldn't leave any long-term issues, but itâs always best to double-check.

Let me know how it goes, and if anything unexpected pops up with the drive format or remaining mounts! ð

It looks like the 
Disk Drill
 process is not running in the background anymore (no active 
drill
 processes found). However, the suspicious 

.DDPreviewDisk
 mount
 is still there.

Hereâs what we can do next:

Steps to Remove 
.DDPreviewDisk

Force Unmount 
.DDPreviewDisk

Since 
.DDPreviewDisk
 is still showing up in your mount list, letâs unmount it manually:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

This should forcefully remove it from the system.

Reboot and Check Again

After unmounting, reboot your Mac:

bash

Copy

sudo reboot

After rebooting, run the following to check if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 reappears:

bash

Copy

mount

If it 
doesnât come back
, this suggests that it was indeed tied to 
Disk Drill
 or an associated process.

Further Checks:

Ensure Disk Drill Isn't Re-Installing or Running on Startup

Even though you stopped any processes, check if 
any remnants
 are configured to mount 
.DDPreviewDisk
 automatically on startup. Look for relevant files in these directories:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

Verify That You No Longer Need Disk Drill

If you're satisfied with the data recovery, 
consider uninstalling Disk Drill completely
 to prevent any future surprises:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Disk\ Drill.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/CleverFiles
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.cleverfiles.DiskDrill.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Extensions/DiskDrill.kext

Let me know how it goes after following these steps! If 
.DDPreviewDisk
 reappears or you encounter any issues, weâll dig deeper into it.

okay I haven't completed the data recover with drip disk yet so lets park that while we investigate the networks drive and any uneccary permissions apart from drill disk that might be lurking already

Got it! Let's focus on 
network drives
 and 
permissions
 while leaving Disk Drill aside for now.

Steps to Investigate Network Drive and Permissions:

1ï¸â£ Check for Mounted Network Drives

Since you're seeing a network drive mounted at 
.DDPreviewDisk
 (which may be linked to an NFS mount), let's confirm if there are any other active network volumes.

Run the following:

bash

Copy

mount

Look for any entries related to 
NFS
, 
SMB
, or other ne
