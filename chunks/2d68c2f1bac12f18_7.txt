twork protocols. Specifically, check if thereâs anything like this:

bash

Copy

.DDPreviewDisk on /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk (nfs, nodev, nosuid, synchronous, mounted by lcl)

If you see anything unusual, we can proceed to remove or isolate it.

2ï¸â£ Check Active Network Shares

To ensure no unauthorized network shares are active, run:

bash

Copy

sudo nfsstat -c

This will show if your system is exporting any NFS shares (and to whom). If there are any unexpected entries, youâll want to disable them.

Similarly, check for any 
SMB (Windows file sharing)
 shares by running:

bash

Copy

sudo smbutil statshares -a

This will list all currently shared network drives. If any of these are unfamiliar, we can investigate further.

3ï¸â£ Check for Unnecessary Permissions

Let's review the permissions on key folders, especially if theyâre tied to network drives or apps you no longer need.

First, check permissions on the 
.DDPreviewDisk
:

bash

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

This will show the permissions of the 
.DDPreviewDisk
. If you see 
read/write permissions
 granted to any unfamiliar users or apps, we should adjust them accordingly.

Next, check the general file permissions for your home directory:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~

This will show all files in your home directory and their permissions. Look for anything 
unusual or unauthorized
 that might have been set up without your consent.

4ï¸â£ Disable Unnecessary Permissions

To stop apps or network services from accessing files they shouldnât, you can go through 
System Preferences
 > 
Security & Privacy
 > 
Privacy
 and manually 
remove unnecessary permissions
 for:

Full Disk Access

Files and Folders

Automation
 (look for any apps that shouldnât have access)

5ï¸â£ Check System Preferences for Remote Management

We also want to confirm that 
remote management
 isnât enabled by accident. Check this:

Go to 
System Preferences
 > 
Sharing
.

Ensure that 
Screen Sharing
 and 
Remote Management
 are both 
disabled
 unless you specifically need them.

Let me know what you find in these steps, and weâll dig into any further network issues or unnecessary permissions!

The output confirms that the 
.DDPreviewDisk
 is still mounted as an 
NFS (Network File System)
 volume, which could indicate that Disk Drill or some other process has configured a network share.

Next Steps to Investigate Network Drive and Permissions:

Unmount the Network Volume

Letâs first try to unmount 
.DDPreviewDisk
 if you havenât already:

bash

Copy

sudo umount /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

If it doesnât unmount successfully, you can force it:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

Check the NFS Client Status

To ensure no unnecessary NFS mounts are still active, you can check the status of NFS on your system:

bash

Copy

nfsstat -c

This will show you if any remote NFS shares are being used.

Ensure No Remote Sharing is Enabled

Double-check that remote sharing services are not enabled:
