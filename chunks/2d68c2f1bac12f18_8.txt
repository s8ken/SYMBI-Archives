Go to 
System Preferences
 > 
Sharing
 and make sure 
Screen Sharing
 and 
Remote Management
 are 
disabled
.

Also, check for 
File Sharing
 to ensure no shared folders are exposed.

Review Home Directory Permissions

Check the permissions for your home directory, especially since we saw the network mount under 
/Users/lcl/.DDPreview/
:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~

Look for any suspicious or unfamiliar entries. If there are strange entries or permissions for files/folders that you didnât set up, letâs review them further.

Look for Unexpected Launch Daemons

Check if there are any lingering network-related processes that could be managing this network share on startup:

bash

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i nfs
sudo 

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i nfs

Once these checks are complete, let me know how things look, and we can proceed with removing any unwanted configurations or permissions.

.DDPreviewDisk on /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk (nfs, nodev, nosuid, synchronous, mounted by lcl)
lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo umount /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

umount: /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk: not currently mounted
lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ %

It looks like the 
.DDPreviewDisk
 is no longer mounted, which is good. Now that itâs unmounted, we can focus on ensuring that any associated network sharing or permissions are fully disabled.

Next Steps:

Verify No Active NFS Shares

Run the following to make sure there are no active NFS shares:

bash

Copy

nfsstat -c

If any NFS shares appear that you didnât configure, we can proceed to remove them.

Check for Remote Network Services

Letâs make sure no unnecessary network services are running by looking at current network connections:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep LISTEN

Weâre specifically looking for any services related to 
NFS
, 
SMB
, or 
Remote Management
.

Double-Check Sharing Settings

In 
System Preferences
 > 
Sharing
, confirm the following are 
disabled
:

File Sharing

Screen Sharing

Remote Management

Review Home Directory Permissions

Run this to inspect your home directory permissions:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~

Look for any unfamiliar files or directories, especially those with 
world-readable
 or 
world-writable
 permissions.

Inspect Launch Daemons for NFS or Other Unwanted Services

Run these commands to check if there are any lingering NFS-related daemons or agents that could automatically mount network drives:

bash

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i nfs
sudo 

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i nfs

Let me know the results, and we can proceed from there!
