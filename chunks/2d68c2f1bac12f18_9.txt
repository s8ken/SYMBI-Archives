The 
nfsstat -c
 output shows some recent NFS operations, but it doesnât indicate any active NFS mounts right now.

Next Steps:

Check for Other Open Network Shares

Let's verify there are no other network shares or unwanted network connections that may still be active:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep LISTEN

Check for Active Sharing Services

Go to 
System Preferences
 > 
Sharing
 and double-check these settings:

File Sharing
: Should be turned off.

Screen Sharing
: Should be turned off.

Remote Management
: Should be turned off.

Review Permissions on Home Directory

If you're comfortable, let's inspect the permissions in your home directory to ensure there are no unusual or suspicious files:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~

Check Launch Daemons for NFS or Other Unwanted Services

Ensure there are no lingering NFS-related or unwanted background processes:

bash

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i nfs
sudo 

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i nfs

Once weâve checked those, we can proceed with further investigation and tightening of permissions.

The 
rapportd
 process is still listening on TCP port 49153, which is commonly associated with the 
TeamViewer
 remote management tool. This suggests that 
TeamViewer
 (or something related) may be installed or active on your system.

Next Steps:

Verify if TeamViewer or Rapport is Installed

First, letâs verify if TeamViewer or Rapport is installed. You can check using the following command:

bash

Copy

sudo find / -iname 

"*teamviewer*"

sudo find / -iname 

"*rapport*"

Terminate the 
rapportd
 Process

If you confirm that this is related to TeamViewer or something unwanted, we can terminate the process:

bash

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 397

Disable or Uninstall TeamViewer/Rapport

If itâs installed, go ahead and uninstall it by following these steps:

Open 
System Preferences
 > 
TeamViewer
 (if available) and disable or uninstall it.

Alternatively, remove the files manually if you prefer by deleting the associated folders found using the above search.

Check for Auto-Start Processes

You should also check for any auto-start processes related to TeamViewer/Rapport:

bash

Copy

sudo 

ls

 /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i teamviewer
sudo 

ls

 /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i rapport

Letâs check these, and then we can proceed with tighten
