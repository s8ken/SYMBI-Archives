I can generate a

 for you:

=F0=9F=94=B9 
ffrog
 install + model loading script

=F0=9F=94=B9 Docker 
or
 Podman runner for agents

=F0=9F=94=B9 Optionally a local UI=

Would you like:

Ah =E2=80=94 =
got it. You were trying to install 

JFrog

, not 
ffrog
.

That completely changes the context =
=E2=80=94 and 
it explains why D=
ocker spun up background containers
 or tried to touch inference ru=
ntimes like LLaMA (if JFrog=E2=80=99s tools were bundled with Docker integr=
ation or were mistakenly interacting with Docker Desktop AI tooling).

=F0=9F=A7=B0 What Is JFrog?

JFrog is a 
DevOps platform
 best known for:

Artifactory
: a binary repository manager (for Docker imag=
es, packages, etc.)

Xray
: a vulnerability scanner

Pipelines
: CI/CD automation

JFrog CLI
: command-line tool to interact with the above

It's often used in:

Enterprise-scale software delivery

Secure artifact management

Container image scanning and signing=

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why You May Have Run I=
nto Inference Logs or Model Runtimes

JFrog CLI or Artifactory
 may be integrated into Docker De=
sktop.

Docker Desktop has optional plugins=
 that 
interact with registries
=
 and 
model runners
.

You might have used a 
DevSecOps template
 or Docker Des=
ktop extension (in beta) that triggered inference scaffolding.

Some AI model runners (like 
llama.cpp
) are distributed as =
Docker images hosted on 
JFrog=
 repositories
, so the trace may have been indirect.

=F0=9F=94=92 What Should You Do?

If your goal is 
just to use JFrog
, and not to run any =
AI inference locally, here=E2=80=99s a safe, clean setup path.

=E2=9C=85 Recommended Setup

1. 
Install JFrog CLI

bash

Copy code

brew install jfrog-cli

2. 
Verify Installation

bash

Copy code

jfrog -v

3. 
Login to a JFrog instance or set up one locally
 (o=
ptional)

If you=E2=80=99re testing locally:=

Use 
JFrog=E2=80=99s free Artifactory OSS Docker image

:

bash

Copy code

docker run --name artifactory -d -p 8081:8081 jfrog/ar=
tifactory-oss

You can now access the UI at:

=E2=9E=A1=EF=B8=8F 
http://local=
host:8081/artifactory

Optional: If You Want AI Model Bu=
ilding Too

We can still:

Run 
llama.cpp
 or 
ffrog
 as a 
separate=
 containerized runner
.

Integrate that with JFrog Artifact=
ory to store your quantized models.

But we 
don=E2=80=99t need Docker Desktop=E2=80=99s built-in inf=
erence junk
 unless you 
e=
xplicitly want
 it.

=F0=9F=94=84 Summary

You thought=
 you were installing

You actually got

What you probably want next

ffrog
 LLM runner

JFrog DevOps system (pa=
ckage infra tools)

Clean JFrog CLI + local Docker or Podman

Docker-based model runner

Hidden AI runtime in Docker Desktop

Disable/strip=
 Docker AI tooling, go minimal

Model=
-serving from CLI

Infra scanning, artifact mgmt

Integrate a real model runner 
with
 JFrog if needed

Would you like me to:

Cleanly 
disable Docker AI tooling
 from your system?

Set up a 
JFrog + secure model runner
 dual-stack?

Or just 
focus on JFrog CLI and local Docker registry
 r=
ight now?
