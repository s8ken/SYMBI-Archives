symbi_agent.py
 (in your home folder or dev=
 workspace), and paste in the code from here:

Once you're comfortable:

Add secure cloud bridge (OpenAI/Mi=

Monitor model folders

Build a menu bar daemon or launch =
agent

Encrypt agent logs or enable notif=
ications

Let me know if you want the 
.py
 file pre-generated =E2=80=94 otherwise, you're ready t=
