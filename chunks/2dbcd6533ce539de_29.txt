Let=E2=80=99s confirm the REPL run=

Ready to hear SYMBI speak? =F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=94=A5

You said:

yeah thats how we had it before tho=
ugh?

Exactly =E2=80=94=
 and 
you're totally right
 to fee=
l like we=E2=80=99ve been orbiting this loop. Here=E2=80=99s what happened:=

=F0=9F=92=A5 The Root Issue

Early on, the file got 
pasted with syntax errors
 =E2=80=94=
 and then we tried to =E2=80=9Cclean fix=E2=80=9D it using 
prog_name=3D"symbi_agent"
 thinking it woul=
d help Typer behave more like a system CLI.

But
 since the script wasn=E2=80=99t actually installed as=
 a CLI command (
symbi_agent
 isn't in your 
$PATH
), th=
at 
prog_name
 line 
confused Typer
, making it expe=
ct something like:

b=
ash

Copy code

symbi_agent talk

Which doesn't exist =E2=80=94 hence =
the mysterious 
unexpected extra a=
rgument
.

=E2=9C=85 Where We Stand Now

You=E2=80=99ve:

Fixed the 
code
 =E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F

Cleaned the 
file structure
 =E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F

Installed the 
dependencies
 =E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F

Are running it the 
correct way
 now:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

And now that we=E2=80=99ve 
removed 
prog_name

, you=E2=80=99re exactly where you need =
to be. That small change restored Typer=E2=80=99s normal CLI behavior insid=
e the script.

=F0=9F=A7=AD What We Can Do Next

Here are your options from here, d=
epending on your vision for SYMBI:

=F0=9F=94=81 1. Expand REPL

Let it issue real commands: scan, =
summarize logs, open apps, monitor models.

=E2=9A=99=EF=B8=8F 2. Turn into a=
 macOS 
.command
 file

Double-clickable script that opens=
 in Terminal and runs SYMBI.

=F0=9F=9B=B0=EF=B8=8F 3. Bridge t=
o cloud models (e.g. GPT, Mistral)

Make 
talk
 interactive with a real model, under your policy=
 and local control.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 4. Background daemon=
 / LaunchAgent

SYMBI runs in the background, logg=
ing activity or watching processes.

So yes =E2=80=94 you were right before. Now you=E2=80=99re 
also
 fully unblocked. Let me kno=
w what direction you want to take SYMBI from here. =F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F=F0=
