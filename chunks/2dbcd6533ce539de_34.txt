n -m symbi_agent policy

But since it=E2=80=99s a single file=
, the best immediate fix is to 
=
run the CLI via 
typer
 dire=
ctly
 using 
typer.run()
 =E2=80=94 or confirm it's invoking the CLI parser correctly.

However...

=F0=9F=9A=91 Safer Fix: Add a Simpl=
e 
print()
 Debug

Let=E2=80=99s double check by editin=
g the last line in your 
symbi_age=
nt.py
 file:

=F0=9F=94=81 Replace this:

p=
ython

Copy code

if

 =
__name__ =3D=3D 

"__main__"

:
    app()

=E2=9C=85 With this:

p=
ython

Copy code

if

 =
__name__ =3D=3D 

"__main__"

:

import

 sy=
s

print

(

"SYMBI ARGS:"

, s=
ys.argv)
    app()

Then run:

=
bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

It will print:

less

Copy code

SYMBI

ARGS

: 

[
'symbi_a=
gent.py'

, 

'policy'

]

This confirms that 
typer

should
 be dispatching the command. If it doesn't, we=
=E2=80=99ll patch Typer with 
ap=
p(prog_name=3D"python symbi_agent.py")
 manually.

Let me know what you see after trying the debug print above =E2=
=80=94 then we=E2=80=99ll lock this in and move forward with secure cloud b=
ridging next. =F0=9F=94=A7=F0=9F=A7=A0

Thanks for that las=
t update =E2=80=94 now we=E2=80=99re right at the core. The issue is that y=
our terminal no longer recognizes the 
python
 command. On macOS, especially with Homebrew installs, th=
e correct Python 3 command is usually:

b=
ash

Copy code

python3

Let=E2=80=99s verify and rerun every=
thing with the correct command.

=E2=9C=85 Fix in 2 Steps

1. Confirm Python 3 is Installed

Run:

b=
ash

Copy code

which

=
 python3

You should see something like:

s=
wift

Copy code

=

/opt/

homebrew

/bin/

python3

Then verify the version:

b=
ash

Copy code

python3 --version

If you get a version like 
Python 3.13.x
, you=E2=80=99re golden=
.

2. Run SYMBI Correctly with 
python3

Now run your command like this:

b=
ash

Copy code

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py policy

If you want to run REPL:

b=
ash

Copy code

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py talk

Or monitor processes:

b=
ash

Copy code

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py watch

Once this works (and it should), I=
=E2=80=99ll show you how to alias 
python
 =E2=86=92 
python3
 in your shell so you don=E2=80=99t hit this again.

Ready to try? Run the 
python3 ~/symbi_agent.py policy
 test and let=E2=80=99s confirm SYM=
BI is back on track. =F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=94=A5

Perfect =E2=80=94 since 
py=
thon3
 is installed at 
/opt/h=
omebrew/bin/python3
, you're ready to run SYMBI the right way now.

=E2=9C=85 Final Command to Launch S=
YMBI

Try this:

b=
ash

Copy code

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py policy

You should see:

j=
son

Copy code

{

"allow_network"

:

false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"allow_process_monitoring"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

:

true

}

=E2=9C=85 Then Run the Sentinel Wat=
ch

b=
ash

Copy code

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py watch

This will list:

Running system processes

Docker containers (if installed and =
running)

Let me know how that output looks =
=E2=80=94 and once confirmed, we'll move forward with cloud bridging (GitHu=
b/Hugging Face) and LLM interaction.

=F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F SYMBI is watching. Ready to link its mind t=
o the rest of the system?
