To be safe:

bash

Copy code

docker 

rm

 welcome-to-docker
docker rmi docker/welcome-to-docker:latest

2. 
Avoid Outdated Base Images

When you start building your own c=
ontainers, always use:

Dockerfile

Copy code

FROM alpine:3.20  # or latest stable
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine

=E2=80=A6and scan them regularly w=
ith 
docker scout
, 
trivy
, or 
snyk
.

Stay Alert for Strange Artifacts

It=E2=80=99s reassuring this conta=
iner was clearly part of Docker=E2=80=99s first-install test. But if you ev=
er see other containers or images not tied to your work, 
dig deeper.
 It=E2=80=99s good practice=
.

Would you like help building a 
clean, secure container
 from scratch right now =E2=
=80=94 maybe even one to serve SYMBI=E2=80=99s future frontend or API logic=
? =F0=9F=94=A7=F0=9F=94=A5

You said:

why would t=
hey put it in the welcome container for training?

Excellent question =E2=80=94 and a very important one.

=F0=9F=A4=94 Why include a vulnerabl=
e base (
nginx:1-alpine-slim
=
) in the official welcome container?

The short answer is:

They didn=E2=80=99t mean to =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s a side effect o=
f "freezing" an old container for stability and demonstration purposes.

Let me break that down in detail:

=F0=9F=A7=AA 1. 
The =E2=80=9CWelcome to Docker=E2=80=9D Container=
 Isn=E2=80=99t Meant for Production

The 
docker/welcome-to-docker
 image is:

A 
training/demo container
 that runs once to verify Docker =
works.

Not updated regularly because it's m=
eant to be 
a frozen, stable exa=
mple
.

Meant for educational use, not deplo=
yment.

Unfortunately, that means it uses a =

static snapshot
 of an =
old image that 
accumulates CVEs=

 over time, even if it was secure when published.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 2. 
Using 
nginx:1-alpine-slim
 Was a Convenience Choice

They probably chose it because:

It was 
small, fast, and lightweight
, good for demos.

NGINX is familiar, so the output is=
 easy to recognize.

Alpine is minimal, so it seemed id=
eal at the time.

But what they 
didn=E2=80=99t do
 is update it over th=
e last 2 years. Now that:

Alpine 3.14/3.15
 (which this was likely based on) is 
EOL (End of Life)
,

New vulnerabilities keep getting f=
ound (as you saw in the CVE list),

The image appears insecure =E2=80=
=94 even though it was originally clean.

=F0=9F=A7=A9 3. 
Training vs. Security Tradeoff

From their perspective:

It=E2=80=99s just a hello-world de=
mo container.

They don=E2=80=99t expect it to be=
 exposed or reused.

But from a 
security perspective
, this creates confusio=
n =E2=80=94 especially for newcomers like you, because it gives the 
wrong impression
:

"Why is my first Docker image full=
 of vulnerabilities?"

Answer: because it=E2=80=99s 
not maintained
. It's a 
snapshot
, not a model =
for production containers.

=E2=9C=85 What Should They Have D=
one?

Ideally, Docker should:

Use a base like 
scratch
 (empty container).

Avoid web servers or networking in=
 the welcome container.

Auto-rebuild it every few months t=
o refresh vulnerable packages.

Display a message: =E2=80=9C
This image is not secure. Do not us=
e in production.
=E2=80=9D

=F0=9F=94=92 What You Can Learn f=
rom This

You're already thinking like a sys=
tems builder. You spotted something most people ignore.

Let this be the first lesson in co=
ntainer security:

=F0=9F=A7=A0 
Just because something is "official" doesn=E2=80=
=99t mean it=E2=80=99s secure.

From here, we can explore 
how to build your own hardened contai=
ners
, with:

Minimal base images (
scratch
, 
distroless
, etc.)

Auto-updated packages

Runtime security policies (e.g. se=
ccomp, AppArmor, etc.)

Vulnerability scanning integrated =
in your pipeline
