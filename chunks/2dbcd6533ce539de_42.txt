=E2=80=A6is a direct 
Raycast AI Chat instance
, likely your=
 current or recent session.

=F0=9F=94=8D What It Does

This URL opens a 
specific context or thread
 inside the Ra=
ycast AI interface =E2=80=94 useful if:

You want to reopen the session

You want to feed the output back to =
SYMBI

You want to connect 
Raycast AI=E2=80=99s output to your local agent=

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Next Moves: Zero-Code =
Integration

If you want to bridge Raycast AI to =
SYMBI cleanly, here=E2=80=99s the 
zero-code workflow
:

1. =E2=9C=A8 Use Raycast AI to outp=
ut 
exact SYMBI commands

Set the AI prompt to:

"Translate requests into one of: 
watch
, 
cleanup
, 
policy
, or 
update_polic=
y
. Output only the command."

Then it will return:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

2. =E2=9A=A1 Enable =E2=80=9CSend t=
o Terminal=E2=80=9D in Raycast AI Command

This lets the output of the above c=
ommand get 
run directly
 in your local terminal (triggering SYMBI).

=E2=9C=85 Net Result:

You type or say:

=E2=80=9CClean up Docker and show =
policy=E2=80=9D

Raycast AI returns:

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup && python ~/sy=
mbi_agent.py policy

And SYMBI runs it =E2=80=94 no scr=
ipts, no manual typing.

Want me to craft the exact Raycast AI Command setup instruction=
s, or generate a ready-to-import 
.raycast
 config?

the issue=
 I have its its not like confirming or responding 

Symbi said:

Yes =E2=80=94 that=E2=80=99s 
the
 core friction right now:

You're issuing commands via Raycast, but 
there's no clear confirmation or feedback
, making it feel=
 like you=E2=80=99re talking into the void.

Let=E2=80=99s fix that cleanly and v=
isually.

=E2=9C=85 Step-by-Step Fix: Give SY=
MBI a Voice in Raycast

=F0=9F=9B=A0=EF=B8=8F 1. Add Visual=
 Output to SYMBI (already done =E2=9C=85)

SYMBI already prints things like:

=F0=9F=94=8D SYMBI is watching your system...

=E2=9C=85 Cleanup complete.

But if Raycast is set to 
=E2=80=9Crun in background=E2=80=9D
, you=E2=80=99ll never see that output.

=F0=9F=92=A1 2. Fix Raycast Script =
Command Settings

In Raycast:

Open the script command you're using=
 for SYMBI

Set 
=E2=80=9CMode=E2=80=9D
 to:

=E2=9C=85 
Show in Raycast

or

=E2=9C=85 
Run in Terminal

This ensures output appears in a vis=
ible window.

=F0=9F=A7=AA 3. (Optional) Add a Ma=
c Notification

If you want a system-level 
confirmation pop-up
, I can add =
this to SYMBI:

=
python

Copy code

subprocess.run([

"osascript"

, 

"-e"

, 

'=
display notification "Cleanup complete" with title "SYMBI"'

])

That way, even background runs tri=
gger a visible macOS notification.

=F0=9F=A7=AC TL;DR

Issue

Fix

=

SYMBI is silent in Raycast

Change script mode to =E2=80=9CShow in Raycast=
=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CTerminal=E2=80=9D

Still unclear
