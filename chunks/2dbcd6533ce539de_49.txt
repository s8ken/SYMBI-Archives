=E2=9C=85 Done =E2=80=94=
 your SYMBI cloud agent is now wrapped in a

 interface.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Next Step: Railway Depl=

Here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ll gen=

Dockerfile

 =E2=80=93 containerize SYMBI API

railway.json

 (optional) =E2=80=93 describe project metadata

Deploy Instructions
 =E2=80=93 one-click setup via CLI or =
GUI

Would you like to deploy from:

Railway's 
web GUI
 (easiest)?

Or 
Railway CLI
 (more power)?

Let me know and I=E2=80=99ll generate your deployment pack.

You said:

okay I need you to g=
o step by step for me as to what you want me doing here - this api where is=
 it going?

Symbi said:

Perfect =E2=
=80=94 let=E2=80=99s walk this 
on=
e step at a time
 so you know 
exactly
 what=E2=80=99s happening and 
where SYMBI is going
.

=F0=9F=94=A7 GOAL: Get SYMBI into t=
he Cloud, Talking via API

We are taking your local SYMBI codeb=
ase and:

=F0=9F=8E=AF 
Deploying it as an API on Railway
, so you can=
 talk to it from anywhere.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 Step 1: What You Just =
Got

=E2=9C=85 You now have a 
symbi_api.py
 =E2=80=94 this is a 
FastAPI web service
 that w=
raps your SYMBI agent logic.

It supports:

GET /
 =E2=86=92 test SYMBI is alive

GET /watch
 =E2=86=92 list running processes

POST /cleanup
 =E2=86=92 trigger Docker cleanup

GET /policy
 =E2=86=92 show SYMBI=E2=80=99s ethics policy

POST /policy
 =E2=86=92 update it remotely

SYMBI becomes a 
remote agent
 you can command via HTTP.

=F0=9F=97=82 Step 2: Where Is It Go=
ing?

We
