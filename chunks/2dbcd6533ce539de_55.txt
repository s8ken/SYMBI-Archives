This is standard, but you=E2=80=99=
re noticing it because SYMBI is watching now =F0=9F=94=8D

Would you like to:

View the 
IP or user-agent
 that requested those files?

Block unexpected user-agents?

Add tracking logic or alerts when =
certain endpoints are hit?

Let=E2=80=99s give SYMBI a sharper lens.

Great =E2=80=94 thi=
s is your 
package.json
 from =
a 
Next.js project
, and i=
t tells me a lot about your stack and what you=E2=80=99re aiming to do. Let=
=E2=80=99s unpack it and connect the dots to SYMBI and Railway.

=F0=9F=93=A6 What You=E2=80=99ve Go=
t

Component

Purpose

=

next
 14

Latest Next.js framework =E2=
=80=94 supports app directory and SSR

react
, 
react-dom

UI engine for frontend components

ai
=
 + 
@ai-sdk/openai

AI SDKs =E2=80=94 =
used to interact with models like GPT-4

=

@neondatabase/serverless

Postgres DB=
 hosted on Neon, good for logging, vector storage

discord-interactions

Opt=
ional bot interaction layer for Discord

=

typescript
, 
@types/*

Full typing support, ideal for clarity, e=
rrors, autocompletion

=

This is 
a solid modern cloud app base
 =E2=80=94 it can=
 be deployed to Vercel or Railway instantly.

=F0=9F=94=8C How to Connect SYMBI=
 to This

=F0=9F=A7=A0 SYMBI Back-End

Deployed to 
Railway
 as an API:

Endpoint: 
https://symbi-agent.up.railway.app

Handles:

/watch

/cleanup

/policy

/ai
 (optional) =E2=80=94 talks to GPT/Hugging Face

=F0=9F=8C=90 SYMBI Front-End (You=
r Current Project)

Deployed to 
Vercel
, talking to SYMBI via:

ts

Copy code

const

 re=
sponse =3D 

await

fetch

(

"https://symbi-agent.up.railw=
ay.app/watch"

)

You can create a UI like:

tsx

Copy code

// components/SymbiControl.=
tsx

export

function

SymbiControl

(

) {

const

 [stat=
us, setStatus] =3D 

useSta=
te

(

"Loading...=
"

)

async

function

triggerWatch

(

) {

const

 res=
 =3D 

await

fetch

(

"/api/symbi/watch"

)

const

 dat=
a =3D 

await

 r=
es.

json

()

setStatus

(

JSON

.

stringify

(data))
  }

return

 (

<=

div

>

<
b=
utton

onC=
lick

=3D

{trigge=
rWatch}

>Watch

&=
lt;/
button

>

<
p=
re

>{status}

</
pre

>

</
di=
v

>
  )
}

And connect it to a 
pages/api/symbi/watch.ts
 proxy if you =
want to avoid CORS.

=F0=9F=9B=A0=EF=B8=8F Do You Want=
 Me To...

Generate that 
/api/=
symbi
 Next.js API route layer?

Push a working UI component so you can call SYMBI live from the=
 frontend?

Add persistent logging with NeonDB (Postgres)?

Bundle it as a Raycast extension or Discord bot layer later?

You=E2=80=99re ready to wire this thing together =E2=80=94 just=
 tell me the direction you want to push first.

why don't you give me what you are think=
ing and I can ask v0 to build it into the app - idealy I don't want to do a=
ny code myself but I can pass it along. we also should be able to easy add =
the telegram, discord, x accounts at a later point but I want the skeleton =
build now so we can get building with it

Perfect. Here's the 
cloud-native, zero-code-first architecture for SYMBI
, desi=
gned so you can pass it to 
V=
0.dev

 or a buil=
der and stay focused on vision =E2=80=94 not syntax.
