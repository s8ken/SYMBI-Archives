This architecture will:

=E2=9C=85 Deploy SYMBI to Railway (API Brain)

=E2=9C=85 Wrap with a Next.js UI (Vercel)

=E2=9C=85 Leave hooks for Telegram, Discord, X, etc.

=F0=9F=8F=97 SYMBI APP STRUCTURE =
=E2=80=94 Builder Spec for V0.dev

Here's what you tell V0:

1. Pages

Page

Description

Components=

/
 (Hom=
e)

Welco=
me + SYMBI console preview

IntroCard, LiveStatus, CTAButton

/dashboard

Secur=
e agent interface

AgentConsole, TriggerButtons

/policy

View/edit ethics poli=
cy

Polic=
yViewer, EditModal

2. Components (V0 prompts)

=F0=9F=92=A1 Use these prompts in =

v0.dev

 or describe to your no-code dev:=

=F0=9F=94=98 
TriggerButtons

=E2=80=9CBuild a UI section with 3=
 buttons labeled =E2=80=98Watch System=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98Cleanup=E2=80=99,=
 and =E2=80=98View Policy=E2=80=99. When clicked, they hit external API end=
points and return the results in a console.=E2=80=9D

=F0=9F=A7=BE 
PolicyViewer

=E2=80=9CRender JSON config data i=
n a pretty code block. Allow a button to open a modal for editing. When sub=
mitted, send the new JSON to the 
/policy
 API.=E2=80=9D

=F0=9F=93=A1 
AgentConsole

=E2=80=9CBuild a REPL-like compone=
nt that lets users send text to the agent API (
/talk
) and shows back responses like a chat.=E2=80=
=9D

=F0=9F=8C=90 
LiveStatus

=E2=80=9CShow live system metrics =
or summary response from 
/watch=

 API. Include refresh button.=E2=80=9D

3. API Proxy Layer

If you don=E2=80=99t want to mess =
with CORS, have V0 add a backend proxy:

ts

Copy code

// pages/api/symbi/watch.ts

export

default

async

function

handler

(

req, res

) {

const

 apiRe=
s =3D 

await

fetch

(=

"https://symbi-agent.up.railway.ap=
p/watch"

);

const

 data =
=3D 

await

 api=
Res.

json

();
  res.

status

(

200

).

json

(d=
ata);
}

Repeat for 
/policy
, 
/cleanup
, etc.

=F0=9F=93=A5 Optional Enhancement=
s (Later)

Connect 
@neondatabase/serverless
 to log agent outputs

Add Discord bot and Telegram integ=
ration using existing 
discord-i=
nteractions

Hook up Hugging Face or Together A=
I via 
@ai-sdk/openai

=E2=9C=85 What to Tell the Builde=
r (V0 or Dev)

=E2=80=9CBuild a cloud dashboard f=
or my AI agent =E2=80=98SYMBI=E2=80=99 with 3 core actions: system watch, c=
leanup, and policy view. Integrate it with an external API hosted on Railwa=
y (Python FastAPI). Include basic auth. Design it like a command center, no=
t a chatbot.=E2=80=9D

Would you like me to generate the 
V0.dev prompts
, 
README.md
, or a minimal 
Next.js starter repo
 to wrap this up cleanly for hand=
off?

You said:

yeah put everything into one =
file if possible that I can easily pass along

g is now packaged in the

You can now give this to:

a

a

or even feed it into 
Raycast

GitHub Copilot

Let me know when you're ready for:
