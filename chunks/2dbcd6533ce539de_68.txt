mbi-in-the-cloud.

=E2=9C=85 3. Integrate Supabase (=
Database + Auth)

Create a 
Supabase project

Use Postgres tables like:

agent_logs
 (for console logs or policies)

users
 (Supabase Auth)

bots
 (store bot config)

=E2=9E=A1=EF=B8=8F In your fronten=
d:

Install 
@supabase/supabase-js

Add Supabase URL and key to 
.env

Add Supabase hooks to log REPL act=
ivity

=E2=9C=85 4. Add JFrog / SambaNov=
a (Next Phase)

These will live inside the Python =
agent:

API wrapper functions to:

Call SambaNova=E2=80=99s LLM endpo=
ints (instead of OpenAI)

Push Docker images or artifacts to=
 JFrog Artifactory

Trigger JFrog pipelines before dep=
loyments

Step 1: Deploy Symbi Agent to Railway via Docker (from GitHub)

Let=E2=80=99s do it together. Want me to generate the full GitHub repo stru=
cture and files for you?

Here=E2=80=99s the play, step by step=
=E2=80=94pulled from everything we've mapped, built, and envisioned so far.=
 This breaks into 
four coordina=
ted fronts
: the 
core A=
I infrastructure
, the 
=
frontend interaction
, the 
security/privacy layer
, and the 
symbolic mission
 that drives it all.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 1. 
Core AI Infrastructure (Backend Intelligence)

This is where 
SYMBI lives
: the orchestrator, agent, and AI=
 brain.

=E2=9C=85 
What you have now
:

symbi-core-agent.zip
 =E2=86=92 contains the FastAPI SYMBI agen=
t.

Docker-ready structure.

Python modules for monitoring, polic=
y, container management.

=F0=9F=94=A7 
Next actions
:

Deploy to Railway
:

Upload and unzip 
symbi-core-agent.zip
.

Connect Railway project to GitHub (o=
r upload repo manually).

Add 
Dockerfile
 if not included. I=E2=80=99ll generate one for =
you if needed.

Set environment variables for 
ETHICS
, API keys, etc.

Extend Agent Capabilities
:

Add support for:

SambaNova API (LLM)

Supabase (auth, database)

JFrog (artifact scan/upload)

Optional: Secure networking (tunne=
ls or scoped access)

=F0=9F=9B=A0 
Optional
: You can give me access to inject logic =
for any of the above if you use something like V0.dev or ask in Raycast via=
 function triggers.

=F0=9F=A7=AC 2. 
Frontend Intelligence Console (Vercel)

This is the 
Zero-Code Dashboard
: where you steer, spea=
k to, and review SYMBI=E2=80=99s activity.

=E2=9C=85 
What you have now
:

Next.js frontend on Vercel.

Pages like 
/manifesto
, 
/sovereignty
, 
=
/concepts
.

/symbi
 and 
/ag=
ent-console.tsx
 + 
/syste=
m-status.tsx
 working together.

Trigger buttons and initial worksp=
ace UI.

=F0=9F=94=A7 
Next actions
:

Link to Backend Agent
:

Add API routes in Next.js to call =
SYMBI on Railway (REST/WS).

Use 
.env.local
 to connect securely.

Add Auth (via Supabase)
:

Install 
@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs

Protect routes and log actions per=
 user.

Display Real Data
:

Use 
agent_logs
, 
deployments
, 
threads
 from Supabase.

Visual dashboards of health, polic=
y, scans, and active tasks.

=F0=9F=9B=A1 3. 
Security, Ethics & Privacy Layer

This is what separates SYMBI from =
basic agents=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s consent-aware, ethics-bound, and user-tra=
nsparent.

=E2=9C=85 
What you have
:

ethics.json
 locally managed (allow_network, consent_requir=
ed, etc.)

CLI 
talk
, 
watc=
h
, 
cleanup
, 
policy
 modes.

=F0=9F=94=A7 
Next actions
:

Sync ethics.json to Supabase
:

Let SYMBI pull and persist user-sc=
oped policies.

Add runtime confirmations
:

Before triggering network actions =
or scans, confirm via console.
