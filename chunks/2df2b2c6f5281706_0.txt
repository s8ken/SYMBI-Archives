Let me know how you'd like to procee=
d:

Do you want a summary or analysis of=
 this report?

Are you looking for a specific secti=
on (e.g., experiment results, methodology, or figures)?

Would you like technical data (e.g.,=
 vortex structure characteristics or visualizations)?

Just tell me your goal with this document, and I=E2=80=99ll take =
it from there.

Great =E2=80=94 sin=
ce you're looking for a 
visual ex=
planation
 of the NASA report 
"Flow Visualization of a Lifting-Surface Vortex"
 (1965), here's what=
 I can do for you:

=F0=9F=94=8D First, here's what the=
 report is about:

This paper describes 
visual experiments
 using 
colored smoke and tufts
 to observe=

vortex formation
 over=

delta wings
 and other=
 lifting surfaces at different angles of attack. These are early and insigh=
tful visualizations of aerodynamic vortices generated by wings =E2=80=94 es=
pecially during high lift conditions (like takeoff or maneuvering).

=F0=9F=8E=AF To create a 
visual summary
, I will:

Extract the key figures and illustra=
tions from the PDF.

Highlight the main experimental setu=
ps and vortex patterns.

Reconstruct some schematic diagrams =
for clarity, if needed.

Provide a captioned gallery or visua=
l flowchart showing:

Wing types used

Flow visualization techniques

Vortex core formation and behavior

Give me a moment to extract and prepare those visuals.
