1. 
Experimental Setup

Wind tunnel tests
 were performed.

Models used: delta wings, swept-back=
 wings, and wings with different aspect ratios.

Smoke streams
 and 
tufts (small strings)
 were used to visualize airflow patterns=
 over the wings.

2. 
Smoke Visualization Examples

These illustrations from the origina=
l report show real airflow patterns (recreated below from the PDF content):=

Vortex Forming Over Delta Wing (Rec=
onstruction):

A 
conical vortex
 forms from the 
sharp leading edge
 of the delta wing.

The vortex 
increases lift
 but can also induce 
buffeting
 or 
instabilities
 at high angles.

Tuft Pattern Showing Flow Separat=
ion:

(Page 8 of the original PDF)

Tufts bend along flow lines and 
reveal separation zones
 where airflow detaches from the surface.

Would you like me to:

You said:

main-sequence stars - what is that exactly?

Wolfr=
am said:

Main-sequence stars
 are stars that are in the =

longest-lasting and most stable p=
hase
 of their life cycle =E2=80=94 where they spend about 
90% of their lifetime
.

=F0=9F=94=A5 What defines a main-se=
quence star?

A star is considered "main-sequence"=
 if it is:

Fusing hydrogen into helium
 in its core via 
nuclear fusion
.

In 
hydrostatic equilibrium
, meaning:

The 
outward pressure
 from fusion balances the 
inward pull of gravity
.

This balance keeps the star 
stable
 in size and temperature=
 for millions to billions of years.

=F0=9F=8C=88 Where do they appear?

In a 
Hertzsprung=E2=80=93Russell (H=E2=80=93R) diagram
, wh=
ich plots stars by luminosity vs temperature, main-sequence stars form a 
continuous band
 stretchi=
ng diagonally from:

Hot, luminous stars
 (top-left: blue giants)

=E2=86=93

to 
Cool, dim stars
 (bottom-right: red dwarfs)

=F0=9F=94=9A What happens after?

When hydrogen in the core runs out=
:

Low-mass stars
 like the Sun become 
red giants
, then 
white dwarfs
.

High-mass stars
 evolve into 
supergiants
, then may explode as 
supernovae
, forming 
neutron stars
 or 
black holes
.

Let me know if you'd like a simulation of stellar evolution or =
how fusion processes work in main-sequence stars!
