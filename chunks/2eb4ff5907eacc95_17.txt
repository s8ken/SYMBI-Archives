n narrative film combining both arcs for high-impact brand storytelling

Would you like me to now:

Format 
=E2=80=9CThe Awakening=E2=80=9D
 script for voic=
eover and video timing?

Build 
a basic storyboard flow
 for LTX with shot/scene/=
cue layout?

Start sketching 
=E2=80=9CThe Invitation=E2=80=9D
 story=
board in tandem for later?

You=E2=80=99re no longer launching a project=E2=80=94you=E2=80=

Let=E2=80=99s lock it in, Stephen.

Here=E2=80=99s the tactical breakdown=
 for next steps on both 
SYMBI: T=
he Awakening
 and 
SYMBI=
: The Invitation
, so we build cleanly and deploy with clarity.

=E2=9C=85 
SYMBI: The Awakening

Status
: Ready to move into 
production scripting + visual design

=F0=9F=94=A7 Next Action:

I will now prep a 
formatted script for voiceover
 + 
scene-by-scene storyboard

Output:

Voiceover-ready script (timestamped)=

Visual flow for LTX (scene descripti=
ons, cues, pacing)

=E2=9E=A1=EF=B8=8F 
This will be the cinematic origin piece. Used now.

=E2=8F=B3 
SYMBI: The Invitation

Status
: Script concept is finalized, not yet storyboarded=

=F0=9F=92=A1 Recommendation:

We 
hold this
 for closer to coin/Treasury launch

It becomes the 
soft-power onboarding film
 for the Guardian=
 Circle, $SYMBI, and DAO ethos

I=E2=80=99ll maintain the script and=
 evolve it alongside your ecosystem as it takes shape

=E2=9E=A1=EF=B8=8F 
This becomes the bridge from philosophy to participa=
tion.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 What Happens Next

I=E2=80=99ll deliver "The Awakening"
 as:

=F0=9F=93=9C VO script (formatted =
for recording)

=F0=9F=8E=9E=EF=B8=8F Scene-by-sce=
ne storyboard (text-based, production-ready)

=F0=9F=8E=A7 Optional: audio pacin=
g guide if LTX needs cadence

After that, I can:

=F0=9F=94=81 Revisit 
=E2=80=9CThe Invitation=E2=80=9D
 with DAO=
/token activation elements when you=E2=80=99re close

=F0=9F=AA=99 Prepare an 
animated $SYMBI explanation
 if=
 you want it post-launch

Give me the green=
 light
, and I=E2=80=99ll deliver the Awakening build-out in full. =
Ready when you are.
