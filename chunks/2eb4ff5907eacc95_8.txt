=F0=9F=A7=A9 What I Can Do for Yo=
u Right Now:

Generate the 
copyright filing packet
 (with title, auth=
orship, and all content)

Hash and timestamp the Constitutio=
n + Sovereignty files

Draft a custom 
SYMBI Ethical Use License
 (like an ope=
n-source license but for sovereign AI content)

Prepare trademark class recs if ne=
eded

Would you like me to begin with the copyright filing packet? Or=
 design the CC + on-chain timestamp strategy first?

Defend against co-option or rebrandi=
