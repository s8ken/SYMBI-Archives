what I am looking for is an original bitcoin core wallet pass phrase which might be stored in my macOS backup

ChatGPT said:

Recovering a Bitcoin Core Wallet Passphrase from a macOS Backup

If your 
Bitcoin Core wallet passphrase
 was stored in a 
backup
, you can try searching your 
Time Machine backup
 or manually scanning for wallet-related files.

1ï¸â£ Where to Look for the Wallet Passphrase

A. Bitcoin Core Wallet Files

Bitcoin Core stores wallet data in:

bash

Copy

~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/

The wallet file is 

wallet.dat

 (encrypted).

Your passphrase 
may be stored in a text file, note, or exported backup
.

B. Common Locations for Backups

Your passphrase might be in:

Documents/

, 

Downloads/

, or 

Desktop/

~/Library/Containers/Bitcoin/

A 
.txt
, 
.json
, 
.csv
, or 
.pdf
 file

Inside an encrypted ZIP or DMG file

2ï¸â£ Search Your Backup for the Passphrase

A. Search for "ruby" and "emerald" in Your Backup

Since you recall 
"ruby" and "emerald"
, try:

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup

This searches 
all files
 in your 
Time Machine backup
 for these words.

Refining the Search

If you suspect itâs in a text file (
.txt
, 
.json
, 
.csv
, etc.), use:

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 --include=\*.{txt,json,csv} /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup

This limits the search to 
relevant files
.

B. Search for Bitcoin Wallet Files in Your Backup

Find Bitcoin Core Wallets (
wallet.dat
)

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -name 

"wallet.dat"

If found, you can try 
restoring and opening it in Bitcoin Core
.

Look for Wallet-Related Text Files

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -iname 

"*wallet*"

 -o -iname 

"*bitcoin*"

This searches for 
files with "wallet" or "bitcoin" in the name
.

3ï¸â£ Restore and Access the Wallet

If you find 

wallet.dat

, restore it to:

bash

Copy

~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/

Then 
open Bitcoin Core
 and try unlocking it with your passphrase.

4ï¸â£ Check Your macOS Keychain

If you saved your passphrase in macOS 
Keychain Access
, search for:

Open 
Keychain Access
 (
Cmd + Space
, type 
Keychain Access
).

Search for 
"Bitcoin"
, 
"wallet"
, or 
"passphrase"
.

If found, click 
Show Password
 (youâll need your Mac password).

Whatâs Next?

Would you like a 
script
 to automate these searches? Or do you need help decrypting a
