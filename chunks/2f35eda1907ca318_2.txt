The computed SHA-256 hash of the file is:

b29af10c62218f948eb299e0c68b176ab1c5ecdfe9813bd957bf2c434e90813e

This does 
not
 match the expected hash 

45LehOF92Hsuyqz_guy0LJ5X7pM-NiAiWBm6bUxz1HQ

 from your JSON data.

What This Means:

The file 
has been modified
 or is 
not the same version
 as the one referenced in the JSON.

If you expected the file to match, it may have been altered or corrupted.

If the expected hash is encoded differently (e.g., Base64 instead of Hex), I can convert and re-check.

Would you like me to investigate further? ð

It looks like the expected hash (
45LehOF92Hsuyqz_guy0LJ5X7pM-NiAiWBm6bUxz1HQ
) might be 
Base64-encoded
 instead of a direct hex representation. I'll decode it and compare it properly. Let me do that now.

('e392de84e17dd87b2ecaacff82ecb42c9e57ee933e3620225819ba6d4c73d474', False)

The 
Base64-decoded expected hash
 is:

e392de84e17dd87b2ecaacff82ecb42c9e57ee933e3620225819ba6d4c73d474

The 
computed SHA-256 hash
 of your file is:

b29af10c62218f948eb299e0c68b176ab1c5ecdfe9813bd957bf2c434e90813e

These do 
not
 match, meaning the file is 
not identical
 to the expected version.

Possible Reasons:

File modification
 â The contents of 
english_wikipedia.txt
 might have changed.

Encoding differences
 â If the expected file used different line endings (
\n
 vs. 
\r\n
) or character encodings, this could cause hash mismatches.

Truncation or corruption
 â The uploaded file might be incomplete.

Next Steps:

If you have another source of the file, try comparing it.

I can check for 
differences
 in structure (e.g., line endings, encoding).

Do you want me to analyze the file further to see what might have changed? ð 

You said:

yes

ChatGPT said:

I'll analyze the file further by checking:

File size
 â To see if truncation occurred.

Encoding
 â To ensure it's not affecting the hash.

Line endings
 â To check if 
\r\n
 vs. 
\n
 is causing the mismatch.

Differences
 â Comparing against the expected hash to detect possible modifications.

Let me start with these checks.

Analysis Results:

File Size
: 
277,015 bytes
 â No immediate signs of truncation.

Encoding Check
: The file is readable in raw bytes and appears to contain plain text.

Line Endings
: 
No 
\r\n
 detected
 â The file uses Unix-style (
\n
) newlines, not Windows-style (
\r\n
).

Since no major formatting issues were found, the difference likely comes from 
modifications in the content itself
.
