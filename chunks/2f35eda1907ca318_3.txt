Now, I'll compute the SHA-256 hash for 
female_names.txt
 and compare it with the expected hash from your JSON data. Let me process that now.

Would you like me to analyze the file further to identify potential modifications (e.g., differences in encoding, extra/missing content, line endings)? ð 

You said:

compare it to the first file provided and see if the differences are the same

ChatGPT said:

I'll compare the differences between the two uploaded files (
english_wikipedia.txt
 and 
female_names.txt
) to see if they show 
similar patterns of modification
 (e.g., encoding issues, line ending differences, content truncation, or other structural changes).

Let me analyze the differences now.
