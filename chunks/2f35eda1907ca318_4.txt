Conclusion
:

The two files 
are completely different in content
, not just structurally modified versions of the same dataset.

The hash mismatches are 
not caused by the same type of modifications
, meaning different reasons account for the changes in each file.

If you expected them to be similar or structured the same way, there might have been an 
issue during file retrieval or processing
.

Would you like me to check for additional modifications (e.g., missing sections, different character encodings, or formatting anomalies)? ð

the first file seems to have a story at the beginning can you analyse the words and tell me what it says?

The first portion of 
english_wikipedia.txt
 appears to contain 
a list of common words
 rather than a coherent story. It includes frequently used words such as:

Articles & Pronouns
: "the", "of", "and", "in", "he", "his", "they", "she"

Prepositions & Conjunctions
: "with", "by", "from", "after", "between", "under"

Common Nouns
: "world", "city", "state", "school", "university", "team", "film", "war", "government", "family"

Dates & Time References
: "year", "years", "season", "century", "march", "july", "september", "october"

Possible Interpretation:

This 
does not
 appear to be a story, but rather a 
word frequency list
âpossibly extracted from Wikipedia or another text corpus.

The presence of "doc", "https", "series", and "film" suggests it could be a 
dataset related to Wikipedia or general knowledge text
.

If you were expecting 
a readable passage
, it might be hidden deeper in the file.

Would you like me to search for
