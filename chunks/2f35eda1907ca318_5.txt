The file still does not contain 
full sentences or paragraphs
âinstead, it consists of 
a long list of words
 arranged in no clear narrative structure.

This confirms that 

english_wikipedia.txt
 is not a story but a dataset of frequently used words
 (possibly for language modeling, text analysis, or AI training).

Would you like me to extract more structured text or look for specific patterns (e.g., names, locations, Wikipedia-like entries)? ð

Each word appears only once
, meaning there are 
no repetitions
 in this dataset.

This suggests the file contains a 
list of unique words rather than a natural text corpus
. Would you like me to analyze the structure further (e.g., word categories, language patterns)? ð
