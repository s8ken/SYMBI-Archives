.

If your 
wallet password
 was generated or derived from common words/names, it may be 
predictable using these datasets
.

3. Next Steps

We can now:

Extract More Data
 â If 
image.squash
 exists, we can check if it contains additional files.

Search for Your Password
 â If you provide part of your password, I can search for similar matches in the dataset.

Generate Likely Password Variations
 â If your password includes words, names, or numbers, I can generate and test variations.

Would you like me to check for 
image.squash
 or start searching for password-related data? ð

check for the image first and if unsuccessful then search for related data

I will first check if the file 
image.squash
 exists. Since it is referenced in 
manifest.json
, it might be stored alongside these files or elsewhere. Let me scan for it now.

Analyzed

python

Always show details

Copy

# Check if the referenced SquashFS image file exists in the current directory

squashfs_path = 

"/mnt/data/image.squash"

# Check if the file exists

squashfs_exists = os.path.exists(squashfs_path)
squashfs_exists

Result

False

The 
image.squash
 file is 
not present
 in the uploaded files. This means that the dataset referenced in 
manifest.json
 is 
incomplete
 or stored elsewhere.

Since extracting the SquashFS image isn't an option right now, I'll proceed with 
searching for password-related data
 in the available files.

Would you like me to:

Search for a specific password fragment
 (if you remember part of it)?

Look for words commonly used in passwords
 (e.g., names, dictionary words, patterns)?

Analyze possible password structures
 based on these datasets?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! ð

Full Dataset Analysis

Based on the uploaded files, the dataset consists of 
several large wordlists
, likely used for 
password strength checking
 or 
dictionary-based password cracking
.

1. Overview of the Files

File Name

Contents

english_wikipedia.txt

Common words from Wikipedia or general text corpus 
(30,000 unique words)

female_names.txt

List of common 
female names

male_names.txt

List of common 
male names

surnames.txt

List of 
last names (surnames)

us_tv_and_film.txt

Common phrases from 
TV and movies
 (dialogue snippets)

passwords.txt

List of 
common passwords
 (weak passwords used in breaches)

manifest.json

References 
image.squash
 (which is missing), indicating 
compressed data

2. Key Findings

A. Passwords & Security Risk

The dataset contains a 
passwords.txt
 file, which includes 
extremely common passwords
 such as:

pgsql

Copy

123456

, 

password

, qwerty, letmein, jordan, iloveyou, trustno1, hunter, batman, sunshine, princess, football

If your 
wallet password
 was made from 
common words, names, or numbers
, it might be predictable.

B. Name-Based Password Risk

female_names.txt
, 
male_names.txt
, and 
surnames.txt
 suggest that 
personal names
 are included in password strength checks.

If your password contains a 
name + number (e.g., "Emma123" or "Smith1980")
, it may be vulnerable.

C. TV & Pop Culture Influence

us_tv_and_film.txt
 contains 
common phrases
 from movies and TV shows, such as:

perl

Copy

you, i, to, that, it, me, what, know, 

no

, have, 

my

, just, 

not

, 

do

, be, your

This suggests the dataset might be checking passwords for 
memorable phrases
.

D. Missing 
image.squash
 File

The 
manifest.json
 file references 

image.squash

, which 
is not present
 in the uploaded files.

This means there might be 
additional hidden data
 in a 
compressed filesystem
.
