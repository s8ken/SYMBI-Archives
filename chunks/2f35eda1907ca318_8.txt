find possible variations based on the word lists

ChatGPT said:

I will generate 
possible password variations
 using combinations of:

Names
 (
female_names.txt
, 
male_names.txt
, 
surnames.txt
)

Common words
 (
english_wikipedia.txt
)

Numbers
 (common patterns like years, sequences, and repeated digits)

I'll create variations such as:

Name + Number
 â 
Emma123
, 
Smith1980

Word + Symbol
 â 
Football!
, 
Sunshine#

Popular Phrases
 â 
ILoveYou1
, 
TrustNo1

Leetspeak Replacements
 (
a
 â 
@
, 
e
 â 
3
, etc.) â 
P@ssw0rd

Let me generate the list now.
