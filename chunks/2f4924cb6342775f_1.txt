 password + channel name.

Channel access control
:

Create/join password-protected and unprotected channels

Validate message decryption using the derived key

Tentative joining logic
: Accepts users before decryption confirmation if the channel is empty.

Key commitment validation
: Detects password mismatches without decrypting.

Command support
: Tests 
/join
 and 
/j
 commands.

Edge handling
: Like receiving encrypted messages without keys, and channel ownership transfer

📦 5. 
MessagePaddingTests.swift

Purpose
: Tests padding logic for binary message payloads, ensuring data aligns with expected block sizes for secure transport (e.g. encryption).

Key Test Cases:

Basic padding/unpadding
: Using PKCS#7-like padding.

Multiple block sizes
: Auto-determines optimal block sizes.

Large data
: Ensures no padding applied when overhead would exceed limits.

Randomized padding
: Confirms padding bytes aren't deterministic.

Invalid data
: Handles incorrectly padded data gracefully

🧾 6. 
Info.plist

While this file was uploaded, it wasn't viewable directly here due to format constraints. However, typically in iOS/macOS apps:

It contains metadata like app name, version, bundle ID.

Could include capabilities (e.g. networking, background modes).

Summary

These tests indicate a 
robust, privacy-focused messaging system
 with:

Binary-level transport efficiency

Optional encryption and message signature support

Channel-based chat model with relay and room message types

Bloom filter deduplication

Secure message padding and cryptographic key derivation

If you'd like, I can help generate or extend any of these tests, visualize data flow, or write documentation or architecture summaries based on this suite.
