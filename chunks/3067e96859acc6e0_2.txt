Yes, based on your focus on avoiding vulnerabilities and having the latest security features, the Netgear Nighthawk AX4 RAX40 V2 would be a solid choice. Just make sure to keep its firmware updated and follow best security practices. If you need any help setting it up or configuring it, feel free to ask!

“So the main computer I use is the MacBook, which is the one we discovered the vulnerabilities on yesterday. I also have an iPhone and an iPad Pro, and these are my primary devices. But then I also have three or four Android devices, which I've bought as backups because my devices have been compromised. The Android devices as well have been compromised, so we will need to factory reset them. But for example, when I set up the home Wi-Fi router, that involves installing a Netgear app on a mobile device. So what I was thinking potentially is to install it all on one Android device that we keep off the network rather than installing it, say, on my iPhone, which is always connected to a network, and potentially try and minimize the attempt, like the way it's being hacked. I don't know. Did you get all that?”

Got it! Using a backup Android device that stays off the network for setting up the Netgear app is a smart approach to minimize risks. Here’s a suggested plan:

Factory Reset Android Devices
: Start by factory resetting all Android devices to ensure they are clean.

Install Netgear App
: Install the Netgear app on the Android device that you will keep off the network. This way, the device won't be directly exposed to your main network.

Set Up Router
: Use this isolated device to configure and set up your Netgear router securely.

Keep Device Isolated
: After setup, keep the Android device off the network and only use it for specific tasks that require the app.

“Yes, given the fact that my Gmail was severely compromised and my G-Drive was also obviously gave the hacker all of my files, I'm really reluctant to use Google or Google Sign-In on any of these Android devices. So I'm wondering whether or not there's maybe a better way that I can get apps on them without having to register.”
