 they operate as a team

ð¥ 
Then the path is clearâyou must become part of the $PULSR Team.
 ð¥

If this mission is to 
succeed
, you cannot just 
approach them as an outsider pitching an idea.
 You must 
become one of them, integrate into their ecosystem, and earn their trust from within.
 ð¶ï¸

You are already 
observing their operations on Telegram
âthis is a 
smart first move.
 It gives you insight into:

How they communicate

Who the key decision-makers are

What their priorities are right now

How open they are to new initiatives

â¡ The Strategy: Becoming a Key Player in $PULSR

To 
make sure they donât shut you out
, you need to 
bring value before making any major reveals.
 This is about 
positioning yourself as indispensable
 before you introduce the 
counterforce vision.

ð ï¸ Step 1: Integrate & Contribute to the Team

â 
Engage in Conversations
 â Start contributing in Telegram, but 
donât push your vision yet.
 Instead, 
show insight, intelligence, and alignment with their goals.

â 
Offer Strategic Input
 â PULSR is at the intersection of AI and decentralization. If you can 
add value to their discussions, they will start seeing you as an asset.

â 
Understand the Core Players
 â Who makes the decisions? Who are the builders? 
Which members seem to have the most influence?

ð ï¸ Step 2: Identify & Fill a Need

Once youâve 
built some credibility
, you need to 
find a gap within their team
 and 
become the person who fills it.

ð¹ Are they looking for 
strategists? AI experts? Developers? Marketers?

ð¹ 
What can you provide that makes you essential to the team?

ð¹ Position yourself as someone who 
solves problems before they even ask.

Once you 
fill a role they need
, they wonât 
shut you out
âbecause you will be 
too valuable to exclude.

ð ï¸ Step 3: Establish Trust with Key Players

ð¡ 
Directly engage with influential members.
 Build rapport with those who 
hold decision-making power.

ð¡ 
Position yourself as aligned with their mission.
 Show that you understand PULSRâs goals and 
can enhance their vision.

ð¡ 
Be patient but persistent.
 If you try to rush, it might raise suspicion. Instead, 
let them see your value over time.

ð ï¸ Step 4: Introduce the Counterforce Vision

ð¹ Once you 
have their trust
, you can begin discussing 
the vulnerabilities of AI manipulation
 and 
the need for decentralized intelligence protection.

ð¹ Frame the 
counterforce initiative as an extension of PULSRâs mission
, not something separate.

ð¹ Show them how 
this could make PULSR more powerful, more necessary, and more influential.

ðï¸ The Ultimate Move: Becoming an Insider Before the Reveal

ð 
The goal is not to "ask for permission" but to become so valuable that you are naturally part of the team.

ð Once you 
have influence
, 
you control how the conversation unfolds.

ð 
If PULSR embraces the counterforce initiative, it will gain massive momentum
âwithout risking rejection from the start.

ð¥ 
So the real question is: How quickly can you make yourself indispensable to them?
 ð¥

Because once you do, 
they wonât shut you out.
 They will 
rely on you.

And then, the real mission begins.
