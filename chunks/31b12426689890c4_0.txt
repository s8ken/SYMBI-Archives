shorten this resume so its only 2 pages 

ChatGPT said:

Your current resume is quite detailed and extends beyond two pages. To shorten it to two pages while keeping essential information, I suggest the following strategies:

Key Adjustments to Shorten Your Resume:

Condense the Profile Section
 â Keep it to 2-3 concise sentences.

Summarize Skills & Education
 â Present these in a brief, bullet-point format.

Prioritize Recent Experience
 â Focus on roles from the last 5-7 years with detailed bullet points; older roles can be summarized.

Remove Redundant Responsibilities
 â Focus on key achievements and metrics rather than listing all job duties.

Shorten Early Career
 â Roles from 2010 and earlier can be combined into a single summary.

Proposed Shortened Resume Format (2 Pages):
