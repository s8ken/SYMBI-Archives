 qualify and escalate an example of client fraud which led to the apprehension of key suspects who had committed serious financial crimes against the business. This resulted in us overhauling our client onboarding experience and adjusting our operations to ensure the business was protected against such fraud while also using the patterns recognised to go back over our existing client database to locate other high risk partners and ensure they were either compliant of eliminated from doing business with us.

I have extensive experience in managing key client relationships particularly at my roles at Wex, Payright and most recently Banxa. In all these roles I was not only responsible for managing the customer experience for end users but also managing the relationship with the clients/merchants who those customers had the direct relationship with. Most of my roles have involved me monitoring the overall customer service operation to identify key drivers of customer contact and use this information to inform our customer contact strategy and product development while also reporting back to the business on key performance indicators such as customer satisfaction and staff attrition.

All of my roles have involved me working as part of a large team as well as being responsible for making key decisions. In my last role I was required to downsize the department by over 30% while also maintaining staff morale and customer expectations. I had a similar experience managing the customers service and collections operations during covid where I had to place 50% of the workforce on leave without pay whilst continuing to run the operations with the remaining staff (including myself) on part time wages.

Given this experience and exposure I have a demonstrated ability to deal with complex and confidential information. I have operated at a very senior level managing not only customer operations but also the risk associated with fraud prevention and collections activities. During my time at Payright I managed a team during our IPO which involved dealing with confidential information and similarly at Banxa I dealt with instances of fraud and risk which required me to handle sensitive information with the diligence deserved.

I am flexible and adaptable and am looking for the next challenge in my career. I've just turned 40 and have had some time to reflect on my working careers and am prepared to make the move to either Canberra or Sydney if successful
