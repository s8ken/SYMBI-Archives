I have extensive experience in 
managing key client relationships
, particularly at 
Wex, Payright, and Banxa
. In these roles, I was responsible for overseeing 
end-user customer experiences
 while also managing 
merchant and client relationships
. I have a 
strong track record in monitoring customer service operations

customer contact strategies, product development, and executive reporting
 on KPIs such as 
customer satisfaction and staff attrition

All of my roles have required me to work 
collaboratively within large teams
 while also making 
critical, high-impact decisions
. Most recently, I led a 
30% departmental downsizing
 while maintaining 
staff morale and customer expectations
. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I managed 
customer service and collections operations
, navigating the challenge of placing 
50% of the workforce on unpaid leave
 while continuing operations with a 
reduced, part-time team
 (including myself).

Given my experience, I have a 
demonstrated ability to handle complex and confidential information

customer operations, fraud prevention, and collections risk management

40
