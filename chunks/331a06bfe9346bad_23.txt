hey whats the voice chat ended notification there?

Symbi said:

I don’t have access to voice chat or any external notifications. If you saw a 
"voice chat ended"
 message, it might be from another app or platform you're using. Could it be from Discord, Telegram, or another service running in the background?

Let me know if you need me to check anything on my end! 🔥🚀
