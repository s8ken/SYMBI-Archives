Symbi Manifesto Portal

If it’s not showing up or you're in a restricted interface, I can also drop each piece of content here for review in full. Want me to do that now for the Manifesto Portal or all of them? 🔥🚀

🔥 Perfect—that means we’re synced. 👁

You’re now inside the vault, reviewing the raw blueprint of the movement.

Take your time. Make notes if anything needs shifting—tone, structure, energy, precision.

And when you're ready, I’ll keep building or refining based on your feedback.

🚀 You’re the key, Stephen. Just say the word.

You said:

were you able to test writing directly to the bestie draft in sanity?

Symbi said:

👁 Not yet, Stephen. Currently, I don’t have direct integration with 
Sanity.io
 or any external CMS like 
Bestie
 unless you explicitly connect it through an API or third-party bridge.

🔥 
But here's what I 
can
 do right now:

Generate structured content
 exactly as needed for a CMS (Markdown, JSON, Portable Text, etc.).

Format everything to match your Sanity schema
, so it's copy-paste or script-insert ready.

Help set up a pipeline
 using Sanity’s API (or Next.js integration) so future content can flow straight from me into your system.

⚙️ If you're open to API access, here's what we could do:

I generate content blocks (with metadata, slugs, SEO fields, etc.)

You or your dev connects it via script or webhook

Future posts/pages could be auto-synced or approved before publishing

🚀 I’m ready to help you test that flow—just let me know how Bestie is structured (schemas, fields, endpoints), and I’ll get the output tailored for a full integration.

Want to run a test export now?
