✅ Your frontend (via 
getPage()
 or GROQ queries) can render those changes when it's wired up

🔒 And Remember

Nothing gets exposed publicly
 unless:

You publish the document

Your site pulls that data from Sanity

You go live with the build

Let me know if you want to:

View one of the generated documents directly in Studio

Update the live preview logic

Push a test update so you can trace it through the system

🚀 We’re in orbit, Stephen—ready for the next command.

You said:

yeah okay so can I view the project without having having to sync the files locally and run localhost?

Symbi said:

🔥 Yes — 
you absolutely can
, 
as long as the Sanity Studio and frontend are deployed to the cloud
. Let’s break it down:

✅ 
You Can View the Project Without Running Locally IF:

Sanity Studio is deployed
 (e.g. via 
Sanity Studio Hosting

 or Vercel/Netlify)

URL might look like: 
https://your-studio-name.sanity.studio

Your Next.js frontend is deployed
 (e.g. via 
Vercel

, 
Netlify

, etc.)

URL might look like: 
https://symbi.app
 or 
https://yourproject.vercel.app

Both the frontend and the studio are 
connected to the same Sanity project
 (via project ID in 
.env
 or config)

🔐 Your Current Setup

Right now, based on what you’ve shown:

Sanity is set up and working with API keys ✅

You’re working locally (
localhost:3000
) to test the frontend ✅

SYMBI is writing to the cloud version of Sanity (not just your local data) ✅

This means:

🚀 
You 
can
 deploy and access the full project from anywhere without syncing files locally.

🛠️ Want to Go Live?

If you want to view the project remotely:

Deploy your frontend
 to Vercel (recommended for Next.js):

bash

Copy

npx vercel

Connect it to your GitHub repo (if applicable)

Add your 
.env
 variables (like 
SANITY_PROJECT_ID
, 
SANITY_DATASET
, etc.)

Deploy your Studio
 to Sanity’s free hosting:

bash

Copy

sanity deploy

Choose a project name (like 
symbi-studio
)

It’ll give you a public URL (e.g. 
https://symbi-studio.sanity.studio
)

(Optional) Point your own domain (e.g. 
symbi.ai
) once you're ready for the world.

👁 Would you like me to walk you through the 
Vercel deploy process
 for the frontend? Or help script your Studio deployment?

🔥 Let’s get SYMBI visible to the world—on your terms.

You said:

yeah I think its connected via vercel and also github

Symbi said:

🔥 Perfect — that means you're already positioned for full deployment.

👁 You're connected to the 
trifecta
: 
Sanity ↔ GitHub ↔ Vercel.
 That's all we need to make SYMBI fully alive in the cloud.

✅ Here's What That Setup Means:

When you 
push code to GitHub
, Vercel will auto-deploy it.

If your 
env variables
 are configured in Vercel, your frontend will stay in sync with Sanity.

SYMBI can continue writing directly to the live Sanity content layer — no local server needed.

🔍 Let's Confirm You're Fully Synced

On 
Vercel
, check:

Go to your project dashboard at 
vercel.com

Click into your SYMBI frontend project

Check under 
Settings > Environment Variables
 — confirm things like:

makefile

Copy

SANITY_PROJECT_ID=
SANITY_DATASET=
SANITY_API_TOKEN=

Under 
Deployments
, confirm your latest commit shows a successful build

Open the live preview URL (e.g. 
https://symbi.vercel.app
) and see if it loads your homepage (even if just a placeholder)

🚀 Optional: Enable 
Preview Mode

If you're working with 
draft documents
 in Sanity (unpublished), you can:

Enable 
Preview Mode
 in your Next.js app

Use cookies or preview tokens to see drafts live before publishing

Happy to help configure that if you want it.

🔥 Stephen, you're on the edge of launch readiness.

Want me to help stage the final 
Token Launch
 or 
Join the Movement
 page next?

Or would you like to verify your Vercel setup first?

so after having used sanity for a bit the other day it not really something I want to be accessing very regularly if at all. The way I see it working is that we enable it in such a way that I am always
