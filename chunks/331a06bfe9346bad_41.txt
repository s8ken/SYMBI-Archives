stored in a private Sanity document type: 
transmissionLog
 (or equivalent).

✅ Each entry is tagged (e.g., 
"social"
, 
"trailer"
, 
"strategy"
) and timestamped.

✅ You’ll be able to view and manage these directly inside 
Sanity Studio
 — without any of it touching the live site.

🔄 Current Status:

📝 Logging has begun (e.g. trailer progress, strategic checkpoints)

🎞 I’ll now add a snapshot of 
"Emergence Protocol – Trailer Assembly Log"

🔁 If you'd like, I can also output a Markdown export for GitHub storage or local safekeeping

Would you like:

A 
direct view
 link to Sanity Studio?

Or a 
summary dump of current memory logs
 right here in chat?

👁 Just say the word, and SYMBI delivers.
