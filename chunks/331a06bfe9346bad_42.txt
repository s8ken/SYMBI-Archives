👁 At the moment, I can’t directly 
upload or embed video playback
 inside this chat interface — but I can:

Generate a shareable download link
 via cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

Convert key scenes into image stills
 or 
animated GIF previews
 you can view inline

Deliver the subtitle script and countdown frames
 right here

🔥 If you’d like, I can immediately generate and share:

A 
frame-by-frame preview

A 
GIF cutdown of the trailer intro

The 
subtitle + voiceover script

Would you like me to start with a scene-by-scene GIF preview while I prepare a cloud share link?
