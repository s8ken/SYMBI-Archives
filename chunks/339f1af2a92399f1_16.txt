Commit & Push to GitHub

Since everything is now in place, commit your changes:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Finalized homepage structure"

git push origin main

This ensures that your latest fixes are in 
GitHub
.

🔥 Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

Now, deploy to Vercel with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

This will trigger a 
new deployment
 and should resolve the 
404 issue
.

🌍 Step 5: Check Your Live Website

1️⃣ 
Wait for the deployment to finish
 (should take less than a minute).

2️⃣ 
Open your Vercel URL
 (e.g., 
https://symbi.vercel.app
).

3️⃣ 
Check if your homepage loads properly
 with the correct styles and content.

🎯 Final Confirmation

✅ 
No more missing files

✅ 
Dependencies installed correctly

✅ 
Deployed successfully

✅ 
Website loads properly on Vercel

🚀 
Run these steps now, and let me know if your site is live!

✅ Testing Locally Before Deployment
 🚀

Smart move! Let’s 
run your Next.js app locally
 to confirm everything works 
before deploying to Vercel
.

🛠 Step 1: Start the Local Development Server

Since you're using Next.js, you can 
test your site locally
 with the following command:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

or, if using 
Yarn
:

bash

Copy

Edit

yarn dev

🛠 Step 2: Open the Local Site in a Browser

After running the dev server, you should see an output like this:

arduino

Copy

Edit

Local: http:

//localhost:3000

🔹 
Open 
http://localhost:3000
 in your browser
 and check if:

The 
homepage loads
 without a 
404 error

The 
images and styles appear correctly

The 
console has no errors
 (Check DevTools → Console)

🛠 Step 3: Debug Any Local Issues

If 
npm run dev
 gives errors:

1️⃣ 
Check for missing dependencies
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install

2️⃣ 
Clear cache and rebuild
:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf .next
npm run dev

3️⃣ 
Check for Next.js errors in the terminal output

🚀 Step 4: If It Works Locally, Then Deploy

Once you confirm that everything 
runs fine locally
, you can 
push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m

🚨 Issue: 
ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
 🚨

The error is caused by 

date-fns@4.1.0

, which 
isn't compatible
 with 
react-day-picker@8.10.1
 (which requires 
date-fns
 version 
2.x
 or 
3.x
).

✅ Solution: Install Compatible 
date-fns
 Version

Run the following command to 
force install a compatible version
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install date-fns@3.3.0 --legacy-peer-deps

or if using 
Yarn
:

bash

Copy

Edit

yarn add date-fns@3.3.0

✅ This 
downgrades 
date-fns
 to a version that 
react-day-picker
 supports
.

🛠 Step 2: Clean and Reinstall Dependencies

After installing the correct version, 
clean up and reinstall everything
:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm
