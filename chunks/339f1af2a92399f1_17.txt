🚨 Issue: "fatal: not a git repository"

Your project 
is not currently a Git repository
 because 
.git
 is missing. No worries! Let's 
reinitialize Git, commit your changes, and deploy to Vercel
.

🛠 Step 1: Reinitialize Git in Your Project

Run the following commands:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website  

# Ensure you're in the project folder

git init                          

# Initialize a new Git repository

git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git  

# Link to GitHub repo

git branch -M main                

# Ensure you're on the main branch

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories  

# Sync with existing repo

🛠 Step 2: Commit Your Changes

Once Git is initialized, add and commit your changes:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Reinitialized Git and added project files"

git push origin main --force

🚀 This ensures your changes are safely pushed to 
GitHub
.

🛠 Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

Now that your Git repository is set up again, deploy your project:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

If Vercel asks: "Set up and deploy 
~/Documents/symbi-ai-website
?"

Just 
press 
Y
 and hit ENTER
 to confirm deployment.
