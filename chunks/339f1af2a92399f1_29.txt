🚀 Key Findings from Your Deployment Logs

✅ 
Your project deployed successfully

✅ 
Build was completed without fatal errors

✅ 
Deployment was finalized and pushed to Vercel

However, I noticed a 
major difference between this deployment and previous ones
:

🔍 What's Different in This Deployment?

1️⃣ 
Your project used 
bun
 instead of 
npm/yarn

bun install
 and 
bun run build
 were used instead of 
npm install
 or 
yarn install
.

v0.dev likely used 
bun
 by default
, while your manual deployments were using 
npm
.

Bun is faster
, but can introduce 
package resolution differences
.

2️⃣ 
React 19 Dependency Issues (Warnings, Not Fatal)

perl

Copy

Edit

warn

: incorrect peer dependency 

"react@19.0.0"

warn

: incorrect peer dependency 

"react-dom@19.0.0"

warn

: incorrect peer dependency 

"date-fns@4.1.0"

These are 
warnings, not errors
, meaning they didn’t break the build.

However, 
previous deployments may have failed because of stricter npm package resolution rules
.

3️⃣ 
Next.js Version is Different

v0.dev used 
Next.js 15.1.0
, while your manual deployments may have been on 
Next.js 15.2.3
.

This slight version difference 
could affect the build process
.
