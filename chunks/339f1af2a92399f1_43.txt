Step 1: Remove Any Unnecessary Files

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -R

Look for any unnecessary files that were auto-generated and remove them:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf unused-folder-or-files

(Replace 
unused-folder-or-files
 with any extra files you don’t need.)

🛠 Step 2: Ensure Only the Necessary Files Remain

Your project should have:

lua

Copy

Edit

app/
components/
styles/
public/

next

.

config

.mjs
tailwind.

config

.ts

package

.json

✅ 
If any required files are missing, copy them back before proceeding.

🛠 Step 3: Verify 
package.json

1️⃣ 
Open 
package.json

:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano package.json

2️⃣ 
Check dependencies
 and 
remove anything unnecessary

For example, if extra UI libraries were added but not used, remove them.

3️⃣ 
After editing, save & reinstall dependencies

🚀 1️⃣ Restore Files Manually (Ensuring the Correct Version)

Since 
shadcn
 skipped some files, we need to manually 
restore them from the last working version
 to ensure the site looks as expected.

If you 
still have the last working ZIP backup of your project
, you can 
extract and manually copy back
 the files that weren’t overwritten.

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/app/layout.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/components/theme-provider.tsx ./components/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/app/globals.css ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/app/page.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/tailwind.config.ts ./

(Make sure to adjust the path based on where your backup is stored.)

✅ 
This guarantees that all key files are restored and match the correct styling.

2️⃣ Verify the Files Are Restored

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

You should see:

app/layout.tsx

app/globals.css

app/page.tsx

tailwind.config.ts

If any files 
are still missing
, double-check your backup and copy them again.

🛠 Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

Once the files are restored:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Manually restored missing UI and styling files"

git push origin main

✅ 
This ensures GitHub is fully updated with the correct version.

🛠 Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

🚀 
Now, the fully restored version should be live with the correct styling.

✅ Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Does the site look as expected?
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Are all UI elements and styling correct?
 ✅

3️⃣ 
Is the Vercel deployment successful?
 ✅

🔥 
Try this now and let me know if everything is working!
