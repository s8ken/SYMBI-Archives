 or Framer for No-Code Management

If this website is mostly static, tools like 

Webflow

 or 

Framer

 let you 
skip all dev work
.

They handle 
hosting, deployment, and UI
 without GitHub/Vercel complexity.

✅ 
No more debugging broken environments.

💡 What’s the Best Move?

If you 
want full control
 → Go with 
Option 1 (Vercel auto-deploy from GitHub).

If you 
want the easiest workflow
 → Use 
Option 2 (v0.dev for UI, GitHub for deployment).

If you 
don’t want to deal with code at all
 → Consider 
Option 3 (Webflow/Framer).

Great! Let’s Set Up Automatic GitHub Deployments with Vercel (Option 1)

This will make 
Vercel handle deployments automatically
, so 
you only need to push code to GitHub
—no more manual deployments.

🛠 Step 1: Connect Vercel to GitHub

1️⃣ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2️⃣ Click 
"Add New" → "Project"

3️⃣ Select 
"Import Git Repository"

4️⃣ Find your repo (
s8ken/Symbi
) and 
click Import

5️⃣ 
Accept default settings
, then click 
"Deploy"

✅ 
Now, every push to GitHub will automatically trigger a Vercel deployment.
 🎉

🛠 Step 2: Confirm That Vercel Auto-Deploys

1️⃣ 
Go to your GitHub Repo

2️⃣ Edit a small file (e.g., 
README.md
)

3️⃣ Commit & push:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add README.md
git commit -m 

"Test Vercel auto-deploy"

git push origin main

4️⃣ 
Go to your Vercel Dashboard → Your Project

5️⃣ Check if Vercel automatically starts deploying.

✅ 
If you see Vercel building the project, auto-deploy is working!

🛠 Step 3: Remove Local Deployment Commands

Since Vercel 
now handles deployments automatically
, you 
NO LONGER need
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

From now on, you 
ONLY push to GitHub
, and Vercel does the rest. 🚀

✅ Final Confirmation

1️⃣ 
Does Vercel deploy automatically when you push to GitHub?
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Does the live site match your GitHub version?
 ✅

3️⃣ 
No more manual 
vercel --prod
 needed?
 ✅

🔥 
Try these steps, and let me know if auto-deploy is working!
 💥🚀

You said:

okay before I do that how do I test what we have in the GitHub repo directly?

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

🚀 
Great question! Let’s first test the current GitHub repo version locally before setting up auto-deployments.

This will ensure that 
the version in GitHub is correct and works before we link it to Vercel.

🛠 Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repo to a Fresh Local Folder

To make sure your local version 
matches GitHub exactly
, start fresh by cloning the repo.

1️⃣ Navigate to your desired workspace directory:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents  

# Or wherever you want to store the project

2️⃣ 
Clone the repo from GitHub
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

clone

 https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git symbi-ai-website

3️⃣ 
Go into the project folder
:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi-ai-website

4️⃣ 
Check that you're on the correct branch (
main
)
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

✅ 
If it says "On branch main" and no uncommitted changes, you're good.

🛠 Step 2: Install Dependencies

Now, install all required dependencies from 
package.json
:

bash

Copy

Edit

bun install  

# (If using Bun)

# OR

npm install  

# (If using npm)

✅ 
This ensures your local environment has everything GitHub has.

🛠 Step 3: Run the Project Locally

Now, start the development server:

bash

Copy

Edit

bun run dev  

# (If using Bun)

# OR

npm run dev  

# (If using npm)

➡️ Open 

http://localhost:3000

 in your browser.

🔍 
Check for:

✅ 
Correct styles, logo, and layout

✅ 
No missing files or errors in console (
F12 → Console
 in browser)

🛠 Step 4: Debug Any Issues

If things 
don’t look correct
, check:

Are all files there?
 (
ls -R
)

Are global styles being loaded?
 (Check 
globals.css
 in 
layout.tsx
)

Are Tailwind classes working?
 (
