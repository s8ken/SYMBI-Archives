🚨 
Fixing the 
ERESOLVE
 Dependency Conflict on Vercel

The error is caused by 

react-day-picker@8.10.1
 requiring an older version of 
date-fns

, but your project is using 
date-fns@4.1.0
.

🛠 Step 1: Fix Dependencies Locally

Run the following 
on your local machine
 to fix the dependency issue:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

OR force install with:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --force

✅ This allows npm to 
ignore the version conflict
 and proceed.

🛠 Step 2: Verify Dependencies Locally

Once installed, 
check the exact versions installed
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm list date-fns react-day-picker

✅ You should see:

sql

Copy

Edit

date

-

fns

@3

.6

.0

or

2.

x (compatible version)
react

-

day

-

picker

@8

.10

.1

If 
date-fns@4.1.0
 still appears, downgrade it to a compatible version:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install date-fns@3.6.0

🛠 Step 3: Push the Fixed Version to GitHub

Once the dependencies are correct:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed dependency conflict for Vercel deployment"

git push origin main

✅ 
Vercel will now automatically deploy the updated version!

🛠 Step 4: Trigger a Fresh Deployment on Vercel

If Vercel still fails, 
clear the cache and redeploy
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

Or manually delete the 
build cache
 from 
Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Redeploy
.

🔥 Final Steps

1️⃣ 
Fix dependencies locally (
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
)
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Confirm correct versions (
npm list date-fns react-day-picker
)
 ✅

3️⃣ 
Commit & push fixes to GitHub (
git push origin main
)
 ✅

4️⃣ 
Trigger a fresh Vercel deployment (
vercel --prod --force
)
 ✅

🚀 
Try this and let me know if Vercel deploys correctly!
 💥

why am I doing things locally - is this model avoiding that?

🚀 Why Are We Still Doing Things Locally? Should We Avoid It?

You're 
right to question this!
 The whole 
point
 of using 
Vercel with GitHub auto-deploys
 is to 
avoid needing local installations
 as much as possible.

However, the 
only reason we're troubleshooting locally
 is because 
Vercel is failing due to a dependency conflict
. If we 
fix it locally first
, we can 
push the correct setup to GitHub
, and 
never have to touch local development again
.

🔥 What’s the Ideal Model?

✅ 
You make changes in GitHub (or v0.dev) → Push to 
main
 → Vercel automatically deploys.

❌ 
You should NOT have to manually fix things locally every time.

But since the current dependency issue is 
blocking deployment
, we need 
a one-time fix
