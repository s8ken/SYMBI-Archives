o future updates are smooth.

🛠 Alternative: Fix It Inside Vercel Instead of Locally

Instead of fixing it locally, we can 
force Vercel to use legacy peer dependencies automatically
.

1️⃣ 
Go to Your Vercel Dashboard

2️⃣ Select your 
Project

3️⃣ Click on 
"Settings" → "Build & Development"

4️⃣ Scroll down to 
"Install Command"

5️⃣ Change it to:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

6️⃣ Click 
"Save"
, then 
redeploy the project

✅ 
Now, Vercel will automatically handle this issue during deployment—no local fixes needed!

🔥 Final Steps

If you want to completely avoid local work
, set 
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
 in Vercel.

If you prefer full control
, fix it locally once, push to GitHub, and let Vercel handle future updates.

Understood! Let’s Wipe Everything and Start Fresh with v0.dev

We’ll 
delete everything in GitHub and Vercel
, then 
set up a clean deployment
 using 
only what’s in v0.dev
. This ensures 
no leftover conflicts or issues
—just a fresh, streamlined setup.

🛠 Step 1: Delete the GitHub Repository

Since we’re starting fresh, we need to delete the 
existing repo
.

1️⃣ 
Go to your GitHub repo:

🔗 
https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi

2️⃣ Click 
"Settings"
 (⚙️ tab on the right)

3️⃣ Scroll down to 
"Danger Zone"

4️⃣ Click 
"Delete this repository"

5️⃣ 
Confirm the deletion
 by typing the repo name.

✅ 
Now, GitHub is completely wiped.

🛠 Step 2: Delete the Project from Vercel

1️⃣ 
Go to your Vercel Dashboard:

🔗 
https://vercel.com/dashboard

2️⃣ Click on your 
Symbi project

3️⃣ Click 
"Settings"
 → Scroll down

4️⃣ Click 
"Delete Project"

5️⃣ Confirm the deletion.

✅ 
Now, Vercel is completely wiped.

🛠 Step 3: Export the Code from v0.dev

1️⃣ 
Go to 
v0.dev

 and load your project.

2️⃣ Click 
"Export Code"

3️⃣ Download the ZIP file to your computer.

4️⃣ Extract it into a 
new clean folder
.

✅ 
Now, we have only the v0.dev version—nothing else.

🛠 Step 4: Create a New GitHub Repo

1️⃣ 
Go to GitHub → "New Repository"

2️⃣ Name it 
"Symbi"
 (or any name you want)

3️⃣ Click 
"Create Repository"

4️⃣ Open your terminal and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 path/to/extracted-v0-dev-folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m 

"Fresh start from v0.dev"

git push origin main

✅ 
Now, your v0.dev project is fully in GitHub.

🛠 Step 5: Set Up Auto-Deployment on Vercel

1️⃣ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2️⃣ Click 
"Add New" → "Project"

3️⃣ Select your new 
Symbi
 repo and click 
"Import"

4️⃣ Accept 
default settings
 and click 
"Deploy"

✅ 
Now, every GitHub update will automatically deploy to Vercel!

🔥 Final Confirmation

Only the v0.dev version exists
 ✅

3️⃣ 
Auto-deployment is working with GitHub & Vercel
 ✅

No more local setup needed.
