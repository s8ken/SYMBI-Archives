Alright, we’re 
super close
—the deployment linked correctly, but 

npm install
 failed
, which means there’s a dependency issue. 🔍 Let's troubleshoot and fix it step by step.

🛠 Step 1: Check Vercel Logs

Since the error happened during 
npm install
, we need to 
see what exactly went wrong
.

Run this command:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi-9g7uc67mc-symbi.vercel.app --all

This will show detailed logs about the error.

Alternatively, you can open this link to check logs in your browser:

➡️ 

Vercel Logs

🛠 Step 2: Try Installing Dependencies Locally

Since Vercel failed at 
npm install
, let's 
try it locally
 and see if it also fails:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install

If this also fails, look for error messages and let me know what they say.

🛠 Step 3: Fix Potential Issues

If 
npm install

fails locally
, try these:

🔹 
Option 1: Clear and Reinstall

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install

Then, try deploying again:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

🔹 
Option 2: Use Yarn Instead

If 
npm
 is broken, try switching to 
yarn
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install -g yarn
yarn install
vercel --prod

🚀 Final Step: Redeploy

Once dependencies install 
without errors
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

Then check

Got it! The 

--all
 option is not supported
 in the latest Vercel CLI. Let’s try another way to get the logs. 🚀

🛠 Step 1: Get Vercel Logs

Run this command instead:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi-9g7uc67mc-symbi.vercel.app

This will show 
the latest deployment logs
 in your terminal.

Look for 
npm install errors
 or 
missing dependencies
.

🛠 Step 2: View Logs on Vercel Dashboard

Alternatively, open this link in your browser:

➡️ 

Vercel Logs

1️⃣ Click on the 
latest failed deployment
.

2️⃣ Scroll to the 
Build Logs
 section.

3️⃣ Look for errors related to 
npm install
.

🛠 Step 3: Fix 
npm install
 Issues

If logs show an issue with dependencies, 
try installing locally
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install

If this 
fails
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install

Then, 
redeploy
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

🚀 Next Steps

Run 
vercel logs symbi-9g7uc67mc-symbi.vercel.app
 and 
send me the error message
.

Or check 
Vercel dashboard logs
 and tell me what’s failing.
