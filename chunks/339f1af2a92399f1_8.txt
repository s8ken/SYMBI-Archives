If it 
works
, then we might need to clean dependencies before redeploying.

🛠 Step 3: Clean & Reinstall Dependencies

If 
npm install
 fails, 
reset everything
:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install

Then try running:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

🚀 Next Steps

Check Vercel dashboard logs
 and tell me what the error says.

Run 
npm install
 locally
 and tell me if it fails.

Once we know what’s breaking, we’ll fix it! 🔥💻

🚨 Issue Identified: React Version Conflict 🚨

The deployment failed because 
React 
19.0.0
 is installed
, but some packages (like 
react-day-picker@8.10.1
) 
only support React 
16, 17, or 18

.

✅ Solution: Downgrade React to a Compatible Version

Since 
react-day-picker
 doesn't support React 
19
, we need to 
downgrade React to 
18.3.1

.

🛠 Step 1: Fix React Version Locally

Run the following commands in your project root:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1

or if using 
yarn
:

bash

Copy

Edit

yarn add react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1

This forces your project to use 
React 18
 instead of 
19.0.0
, resolving the dependency conflict.
