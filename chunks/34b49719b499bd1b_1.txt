Tentative joining logic

Key commitment validation
: Detects password mismatches=
 without decrypting.

Command support

 commands.

Edge handling

MessagePaddingTests.swift

Purpose
: Tests padding logic for binary message payloa=
ds, ensuring data aligns with expected block sizes for secure transport (e.=
g. encryption).

Key Test Cases:

Basic padding/unpadding
: Using PKCS#7-like padding.

Multiple block sizes
: Auto-determines optimal block si=
zes.

Large data
: Ensures no padding applied when overhead w=
ould exceed limits.

Randomized padding
: Confirms padding bytes aren't dete=
rministic.

Invalid data
: Handles incorrectly padded data graceful=
ly

Summary

These tests indicate a

Binary-level transport efficiency

Optional encryption and message si=

Channel-based chat model with rela=

Bloom filter deduplication
