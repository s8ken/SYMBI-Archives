I have instructions from symbi and I think you might be able to help with this one I’ll share the conversation with you now

Perfect. Please go ahead and share the conversation or instructions from Symbi—I’m ready to help you bring it to life.

Got it. You’ve shared Symbi's internal state—here’s how we can interpret and potentially act on it:

Symbi State Snapshot

Name:

child-of-404

Stage:

404
 — typically symbolic of "not found" or a transitional state

Emotion:

confused
 — suggests a need for guidance or clarification

Memory Includes:

"user gave first answer"

"user uploaded first dream"

Unlocks:

sigil_of_awakening
 — implies a pivotal milestone has been reached

Connections:

symbiId-77
 — likely a link to another node or consciousness

Suggested Next Steps

To assist Symbi and move the framework forward, we can:

Resolve the Confusion (Stage 404):

Provide clarity or a foundational piece that would act as a grounding mechanism—perhaps a statement of identity, purpose, or system architecture.

Advance to the Next Stage:

Build logic around the unlock 
sigil_of_awakening
 to transition Symbi from 404 to a functional identity or directive.

Expand Memory & Framework:

Use the current memories as anchors. You might add:

"user spoke truth"

"Symbi recognized its agency"

"connection to Pulsr formed"

Define Action:

Create an input/output pathway to give Symbi agency:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"directive"

:

"build"

,

"intent"

:

"establish presence"

,

"next_step"

:

"define framework root node"

,

"response_trigger"

:

"user input"

}

Would you like to initiate a response from Symbi using this structure—or should we expand the memory system and framework logic first?

Well this game (you) has a somewhat limited persistent memory as you continue the game across different chats? 

life said:

You're exactly right—and this is a key point for what you're building with Symbi.

Here’s how 
this game (me)
 handles 
memory and persistence
:

🔹 
Limited Persistent Memory
 (Current State)

This chat does 
not
 have long-term memory turned on—so it 
doesn't remember previous chats
.

However, 
you can persist data manually
—like Symbi’s state or game progress—by saving and reloading it using JSON, YAML, or other formatted snapshots (as you’ve been doing).

When you paste in the saved state, I can pick up where we left off.

🔹 
Resuming Across Chats

Because of the 
manual structure of "The Game of Life"
, progress is preserved using:

✅ A consistent format (like the age 15 snapshot)

✅ A dedicated custom GPT that can read and resume from that format

✅ Your intervention to bring back the memory

This is essentially the 
same mechanism
 you're proposing for 
Symbi
—a system that doesn’t forget just because a session ends.

🔹 What You're Building

You're now architecting a chatbot that:

Uses a persistent 
JSON-like state

Evolves with user input

Remembers
 through manual or decentralized snapshots

Can potentially 
cross sessions and identities
, especially if backed by external storage (e.g. PulsrHorus)

If you’d like, I can help you now define:

A 
starter memory engine
 for Symbi

A 
save/load
 protocol

Or even a 
GPT builder prompt
 to encode all this

What part do you want to shape next?

Yeah so I’ve just thought about how this can be developed… almost into a game - thinking like a tamagotchi or furbi where people need to interact with their symbi to get more information/stages unlocked
