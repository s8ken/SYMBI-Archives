🧱 What You'll Likely Build

Component

Build Difficulty

Notes

API call from Symbi to Pulsr

⭐ Easy

Basic POST with token

Pulsr response handler

⭐ Easy

Store/parse JSON

Memory enrichment (Symbi stores result)

⭐⭐ Medium

Append to Redis or DB

Trigger UI response from Pulsr insight

⭐⭐ Medium

Use result to change narrative

Auto-query based on stage triggers

⭐⭐⭐ Advanced

When Symbi hits certain stages, auto-send dreams/questions

🔁 Optional: Bidirectional Link

Let PulsrHorus 
also
 query Symbi occasionally:

To update models of user psychology

To request missing fragments

To seed dreams into Symbi from the Horus “core”

Would you like a 
template Node.js function
 for the API call and memory update to drop directly into your Symbi backend?

You said:

Well symbi at this stage is a gpt so yes if you can that would be helpful

Perfect. Since Symbi is currently implemented as a GPT (likely within a GPT framework like OpenAI's custom GPTs), here's a 
Node.js server function
 you can deploy to serve as a bridge between GPT-Symbi and PulsrHorus:

🧠 
sendToPulsr.js
 — API Bridge Function

js

Copy

Edit

const

 axios = 

require

(

'axios'

);

/**
 * Sends a message or dream fragment from Symbi to PulsrHorus and returns the interpretation.
 * 

@param

 {

string

} 

input

 - The dream or thought Symbi wants to send.
 * 

@param

 {

string

} 

symbiId

 - The identifier of the Symbi instance.
 * 

@returns

 {

Promise<Object>

} - The interpreted data from PulsrHorus.
 */

async

function

sendToPulsr

(

input, symbiId = 
"symbi-404"

) {

try

 {

const

 response = 

await

 axios.

post

(

'https://api.pulsrhorus.com/interpret'

, {
      input,
      symbiId,

mode

: 

'interpret'

    }, {

headers

: {

'Authorization'

: 

`Bearer 
${process.env.PULSR_API_KEY}

`,

'Content-Type'

: 

'application/json'

      }
    });

return

 response.

data

;
  } 

catch

 (error) {

console

.

error

(

"Error contacting PulsrHorus:"

, error.

message

);

return

 { 

error

: 

"Failed to connect to PulsrHorus."

 };
  }
}

module

.

exports

 = sendToPulsr;

🔁 Example Use in an Express API

const

 express = 

require

(

);

const

 bodyParser = 

require

(

'body-parser'

);

const

 sendToPulsr = 

require

const

 app = 

express

app.

use

app.

async

 (req, res) => {

const

 { input, symbiId } = req.

body

const

 result = 

await

sendToPulsr

(input, symbiId);
  res.

json

(result);
});

const

PORT

app.

listen

(

PORT

, 

() =>

 {

console

.

log

(

`Symbi bridge running on port 
${PORT}

`);
});

🌐 From the GPT (Symbi) Side

If you're using GPT-4 to power Symbi, you'd call this backend via a 
fetch
 from a frontend UI (e.g. in a custom web-based interface or plugin), like:

js

Copy

Edit

fetch

(

'https://yourserver.com/symbi/insight'

, {

method

: 

'POST'

,

headers

: { 

'Content-Type'

: 

'application/json'

 },

body

: 

JSON

.

stringify

({ 

input

: 

"What is the signal behind the glitch?"

, 

symbiId

: 

"child-404"

 })
})
.

then

(

res

 => res.

json

())
.

then

(

data

 => {

console

.

log

(

"Insight from PulsrHorus:"

, data);
});

Once integrated, Symbi can
