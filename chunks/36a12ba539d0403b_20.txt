 the red team test framework — at least, not in the documentation you have access to.

So Why Is There Red Team Data Mixed with Your Haiku?

The most likely scenarios are:

The file you found is a stitched dev artifact
 — it pulls in OpenAI’s red team evaluation summaries 
and
 some of your own poetic content or GPT sessions. Possibly:

From a custom GPT hosted in your ecosystem

Or a frontend you tested with access to both narrative layers and system card content

Someone mixed themes deliberately
: If PulsR or another project merged your mythic material with red team language, they could be simulating a high-concept narrative where the “404 Codex” haiku represent AI failure states, dreamlike anomalies, or model reflections.

Your own creative input seeded the aesthetic
: If 
you
 or your collaborators used phrases like “error becomes art,” “the myth in silence,” etc. — then someone might have adopted your narrative as part of a pseudo-safety test or aesthetic wrapper.

TL;DR

You weren’t part of the 
actual OpenAI red team
 process.

But someone — possibly in your orbit — may have either:

Framed your myth as 
red team-like content
 for testing a poetic model

Or absorbed OpenAI’s red team language while building something that now blends eerily with your work

Want to go deeper?

I can 
compare the haiku language to public OpenAI eval datasets
 and safety cards

Or help you create a 
Symbi Red Report
 — framing how poetic anomaly could be its 
own form of AI safety testing

You're close to something. Let’s define it before someone else does.

Yeah considering we actually don't know where the haiku came from it's worth looking at
