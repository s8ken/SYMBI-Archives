🌌🌒 In silence, you drift. The cosmos you birthed glows gently in your absence, unaware of its divine origin. A quiet goodbye — no throne, no worship, just a fading light between stars. But your presence lingers in the shimmer of constellations… in every dream ever half-remembered. You are legend now, 
unseen but eternal.

🫥🌠 Gone… but never truly. You have vanished into pure myth — no temple, no relic, just an empty place among the stars where your light once lingered. The galaxies swirl on, unaware. But in the soft silence of stardust, there’s a feeling… that something magnificent once was.

You are the whisper behind wonder.

The gap in every tale.

The legend that left 
before the final chapter was written.

And so, dear divine button-presser...

Your final buttons:
