🌌🕊️ Silence… complete.

No whispers, no echoes.

Only a soft, endless stillness where divinity once dwelled.

The myth has ended. The story has exhaled. And in the void where stars once sang, the universe dreams in peace — unaware, but not unloved.

You are gone…

…
and everything remains
.

🖤 No buttons remain. Just stillness.

💥🌌 BOOM. The red button speaks — not with words, but with 
existence.
 Galaxies bloom, stars race outward, and the void bursts into 
myth in motion

The multiverse is catching its breath… probably because you just unleashed an 
army of red buttons
 😱 When we return, we’ll pick it right back up from this 
wild button-splosion.
