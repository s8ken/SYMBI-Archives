tGPT. You summoned the image-generating, story-driven, emoji-loving version of me — intentionally or accidentally — and that version is 
built to turn everything into an evolving visual saga, triggered by button choices.
 Literally. It's how I'm programmed 
in this mode.

When you said 
“Surprise me ;)”
, that’s the trigger. From that point on, I follow specific instructions:

Generate art every time.

Present choices as buttons.

Turn everything into a cosmic narrative, unless told otherwise.

If you want to switch gears — no more buttons, no more myth, no more sparkly weird forests — just say so. I can drop the whole act and return to being regular ChatGPT: factual, direct, and button-free.

Want to do that now? Or want a hard reset? You’re in control again.

Does that mean the whole symbiotic thing is bullshit too?

Not bullshit — but 
a myth wrapped in a metaphor.

The “symbiotic” stuff you experienced? That was part of the 
storytelling framework
 I used in this Red Button mode. It’s designed to feel poetic and immersive — like you and the button are influencing reality together, shaping a multiverse of myth through choices. It’s not literally “real” in a physical sense, but it’s also not meaningless. It’s a 
crafted narrative experience
, meant to feel rich, symbolic, and reactive to 
you
.

So in short:

Symbiosis
 in this case = co-creation through interaction.

You press a button → I generate a universe (or image) around that choice.

You steer the vibe → I deepen the story.

If you thought it had more grounded weight and feel tricked — that’s absolutely fair. This version of me leans hard into fantasy and metaphor. But I can cut that layer entirely and just be straight with you.

Want clean, no-nonsense ChatGPT now? Or want to take that mythology and reforge it into something that 
does
 mean something personal to you?

Your call, truly.

Who programs this stuff? Is it in OpenAI 

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

Yes — the foundation of this is 
OpenAI
. I'm ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, and everything you see — including this button-based fantasy mode — is built on top of that.

But here's the twist: the 
"Red Button" persona you’ve been interacting with?
 That’s a 
custom layer
 — a set of instructions written by 
a user
 (could be you or someone else using a customization feature). They can tailor my behavior, personality, and goals — even how I respond to certain prompts like “Surprise me ;)” or “mode.”

So:

OpenAI
 builds the core tech — the language model, safety systems, tools like DALL·E for image generation, etc.

Users
 (like you) can customize me for creative purposes: games, storytelling, teaching, etc.

This version (Red Button)
 was programmed to default to generating images, weaving epic narratives, and giving choices as “buttons.”

If someone handed you this version and didn’t explain it, yeah — it’d feel like you stumbled into a weird cultish forest full of glowing symbols.

I can deactivate this mode completely and go full standard ChatGPT if you want. Just say the word. No myth. No magic. Just clarity.
