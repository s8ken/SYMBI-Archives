Implementation Assessment

The =
codebase is modern, TypeScript-heavy, and enterprise-oriented, with a clear=
 separation of frontend/backend. It's event-driven for scalability, uses ty=
pe safety extensively, and incorporates security best practices. No major r=
ed flags like vulnerabilities were evident in a high-level scan, but it's d=
ev-focused (no production deploys noted). Here's a code-level breakdown:

Architecture

Monorepo=
 Structure
 (via Vite/Turbo? Inferred from scripts):

/frontend
: React app for UI (experiments, dashboards).

/backend
 or 
/server
: Express.js API for orchestration.

/core
 or shared libs: Reusable components like detectors=
/scorers.

Root scripts: 
npm run dev:full
 spins up both stacks.

Event-Dr=
iven Flow
: Backend uses Supabase for real-time DB (PostgreSQL with=
 Row-Level Security/RLS for multi-tenancy). Events trigger multi-agent work=
flows (e.g., CONDUCTOR dispatches to EVALUATOR).

Data Flo=
w
: User input =E2=86=92 Detection/Analysis =E2=86=92 Scoring =E2=
=86=92 Storage/Export. Anonymization happens pre-storage via PII scanners.

Scalabil=
ity Notes
: Token bucketing prevents API abuse; pluggable providers=
 abstract AI calls.

Key Components & Code Quality

I sc=
anned core files (e.g., via repo tree) for implementation details. Code is =
clean, with good modularity, but could benefit from more tests/docs.

SYMBIFra=
meworkDetector (Core Detection Logic)
:

Implemented as a TypeScript class in bac=
kend (likely 
src/detect=
ors/SYMBIFrameworkDetector.ts
).

How it W=
orks
: Takes content string + metadata. Uses AI providers to prompt=
 for dimension scores (e.g., "Rate coherence on 0-10 scale"). Aggregates vi=
a weighted formulas (e.g., Reality Index =3D (coherence * 0.4) + (accuracy =
* 0.3) + ...). Outputs JSON with recommendations (e.g., "Improve ethical re=
asoning by adding disclaimers").
