How to U=
se
: In Resonate's detector, import and call it. In Symphony, use f=
or agent verification. Run: 
npx ts-node scorer.ts
 (install ts-node if needed).

Why This=
?
 It's modular=E2=80=94drop it in Vault as a doc example. Builds y=
our dev muscle without overwhelm.

Next Steps: Let's Make This Yours

Today
: Update one README with ecosystem links. Push to GitHub=E2=80=94feel=
s like progress!

This Wee=
k
: Populate Vault with that scorer doc + a 1-page "SYMBI Explainer=
." Clone locally and run Resonate's dev server.

Ongoing
: Join free communities=E2=80=94r/learnprogramming on Reddit, or AI=
 Ethics Discord. Share a "beta tester" call on X: "First-time dev building =
SYMBI=E2=80=94feedback welcome!"

My Help
: What hurts most right now? "Fix my .env setup"? "Explain Supabase=
 without tears"? "Brainstorm a demo video script"? Or drop a specific file/=

oh with symbi-vault you need to go one =

Ah, Got It=E2=

Than=
ks for the heads-up! I appreciate the nudge=E2=80=94GitHub repos can someti=
mes hide gems in subfolders, especially if the root is kept lean for organi=
zation. I dug in with a fresh, targeted scan (focusing on that "symbi-vault=
" folder you mentioned), but here's the honest update: As of right now (Nov=
 23, 2025), the public view of the repo doesn't surface that subfolder or i=
ts contents in detail. It looks like the root is still pretty sparse=E2=80=
=94just the repo title/description without visible files, trees, or branche=
s exposing deeper layers. This could be due to:

Private/=
Branch Setup
: The "symbi-vault" folder might live in a protected b=

 vs. 
dev
), or a=

No w=

r even paste a sample doc excerpt=E2=80=94I can analyze it on the spot for =
summaries, improvements, or links to Resonate/Symphony. In the meantime, I'=
ll revise the Vault assessment based on your tip (treating the subfolder as=
 the "real" content layer), and tweak the overall plan to prioritize popula=
ting/exposing it.

Revised Overview of SYMBI-Vault (With Su=

Updated Take
: SYMBI-Vault remains the =

folder=E2=80=94likely where the whitepapers, kits, and artifacts live. This=
