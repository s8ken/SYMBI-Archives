Revised Implementation Assessment (Doc-F=

No c=

## SYMBI Dimensions

- **Resonance Quality**: Measures innovation (ST=
RONG if >7). See Resonate Lab for impl.

=

Strength=
s
: Versioned evolution of ideas; easy PRs for collab.

Issues
: No searchability (add a 
SEARCHABLE-INDEX.md
); formats mixed? Standardize to MD for=
 GitHub rendering.

Security=
/Compliance
: N/A, but docs could include "Ethical Guidelines" sect=
ion (e.g., PII best practices shared with Resonate).

Overall "Health"

Pros
: Subfolder keeps it tidy=E2=80=94logical for a doc-first repo.

Cons
: Hidden from casual browsers; needs a root README like: "All content =
in 
/symbi-vault/
=
=E2=80=94start here: [link to folder]."

Scan Ver=
dict
: As a doc layer, 5.5/10=E2=80=94structure's smart, but exposu=
re is key. No vulns, just "findability" fixes.

How It Links (Updated with Deeper Layer)=

Stil=
l thematic ties, but the subfolder could hold explicit bridges:

To Reson=
ate
: Kits with "Eval Templates" directly referencing detector prom=
pts.

To Symph=

: Partner docs on "Vault Integration" (secrets flow for orchest=
ration).
