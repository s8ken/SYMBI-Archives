academic-kit-template.md

Overall Code Health

How It Links: SYMBI-Vault with SYMBI-Res=
onate and SYMBI-Symphony

No e=
xplicit technical linkages (e.g., imports, APIs, or cross-references) exist=
, as Vault is doc-only while the others are code-heavy. Searches across Git=
Hub, web, and X found zero co-mentions or integrations=E2=80=94 the ecosyst=
em remains siloed in visibility.

Inferred Connections
 (thematic and eco=
system-level):

SYMBI Um=
brella
: Vault acts as the "brain" repository, housing whitepapers =
that define the SYMBI framework (e.g., resonance metrics used in Resonate's=
 detectors, trust protocols echoed in Symphony's Oracle). It likely referen=
ces or is referenced by READMEs in the other repos for theoretical backing.=

Compleme=
ntary Stack
: Resonate/Symphony implement Vault's artifacts=E2=80=
=94e.g., academic kits could include experiment templates runnable in Reson=
ate Lab, or partner materials detailing Symphony's Vault integration for se=
crets (note: Symphony mentions "SYMBI Vault" explicitly in its trust layer,=
 suggesting a shared concept or future tie-in).

Developm=
ent Overlap
: Shared contributors imply Vault seeds ideas for the t=
ools (e.g., ethical guidelines informing both projects' compliance features=
). Roadmap-wise, Vault could evolve to host shared schemas (e.g., JSON for =
assessments/orchestrations).

Holistic=
 Pipeline
: Docs in Vault =E2=86=92 Evaluation in Resonate =E2=86=

Fair Assessment Summary

Pros
: Fills a critical gap as the SYMB=
I "library of Alexandria," centralizing knowledge for sustainable ecosystem=
 growth. Ideal for academics/partners needing context.

Cons
: Currently a ghost repo=E2=80=94m=
inimal content and zero traction make it feel placeholder-like. Without qui=
ck wins (e.g., a rendered site), it risks irrelevance.

Recommendation
: Valuable as ecosystem =
glue, but prioritize populating with searchable docs. Pair with Resonate/Sy=
mphony for context; clone to verify contents. Score: 5/10=E2=80=94promising=
 hub, urgently needs substance. Share files/screenshots for a deeper doc re=
