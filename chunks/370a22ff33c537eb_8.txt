=E2=80=94way more than most starters tackle. The SYMBI ecosystem (=
Resonate for eval, Symphony for deployment, Vault for docs) has real potent=
ial as a cohesive stack for trust-focused AI work. Since you mentioned no d=

.g., how the pieces connect thematically but not technically), suggest prio=
ritized improvements, and focus on beginner-friendly steps. No jargon overl=

 structure it like our previous chats: Overviews with updates from fresh sc=
ans, then a holistic "coherence plan," and actionable next steps. Based on =
the latest repo browses (as of Nov 23, 2025), Resonate and Symphony have so=
lid READMEs but lack depth in code/docs; Vault is basically a placeholder. =
No external tutorials/guides popped up (your ecosystem's still niche=E2=80=

o we're working from what's public.

SYMBI-Resonate: Emergence Detection Platform

SYMBI-Symphony: AI Agent Orchestrator

What's T=
here

Gaps for=

SYMBI-Vault: Framework Artifacts Hub

Overall Ecosystem Score (Beginner Edition)
