Docs/Onboarding

Sparse READMEs, no trees/examples

Add file trees (run

/docs
 folder with "Getting Started for Non-Devs.md".

Code Structure

Opaque layouts, no shared utils

Standardize: 
/src/core

/src/frontend

/src/backend

.gitignore

README.md

 A Shared SYMBI Scorer (Your First Tweak)

To k=

scorer. Put this in a new file 
symbi-core/src/scorer.ts
 (create in Resonate first, then cop=
y to others). It computes a basic "Resonance Score" from inputs=E2=80=94exp=
