MBI toggle, cryptographic Trust Receipts, and a board-re=
ady CIQ Audit.

Why now
Renewals demand measured ROI and auditability. Ninja=E2=80=99s multi-agent =
runtime + SYMBI=E2=80=99s governance turns =E2=80=9Ccool demo=E2=80=9D into=
 provable value.

How it works

Instrument baseline 2) Enable SYMBI (Context Bridge, Memory Hooks, Safety V=
alves)
A/B Directive vs SYMBI 4) Export receipts + CIQ Audit + exec report
Deliverables (4 weeks)

5-Slide Deck =E2=80=94 Content & Speaker Notes
1 =E2=80=94 Problem =E2=86=92 Promise
Agents wow; renewals require measured uplift + governable safety.
Promise: prove uplift in minutes; package into a 4-week pilot.

Measures: CIQ deltas (clarity, breadth, safety, completion), time-to-task, =
retention
Artifacts: Trust Receipts (per interaction), CIQ Audit (board-ready)

5 =E2=80=94 Why Together
Ninja: multi-agent runtime, distribution, cloud.
SYMBI: governance-first protocol, receipts, proof method.
Together: relationship-aware agents enterprises can audit & renew.
