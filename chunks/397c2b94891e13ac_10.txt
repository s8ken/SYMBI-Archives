Next Steps

If you still need short-name recognition in the chat middleware, add "steph=

Filled in the entire SYMBI vault manifest inside SYMBI-Website-main/SYMBI-v=
ault, creating every document and code artifact outlined in the README inde=
x. Confirmed presence with a quick verification script that checks each exp=
ected path.

Next steps: 1) Review content for any last wording tweaks, then 2) run the =
provided zip + checksum commands if you need an export-ready bundle.

thanks push to repo

Added the full SYMBI vault manifest (whitepapers, partner pack, academic ki=
t, backend/frontend snippets, LaTeX assets) and swapped every remaining cre=
dit to =E2=80=9CStephen James Aitken=E2=80=9D where those files still live;=
 landed in commit 98263069dda31f75b18fb826539765aafa30b323 on origin/main.
Upstream had already removed app/thecircle/page.tsx, so the rebase kept tha=
t file deleted=E2=80=94nothing left there needing an attribution tweak.
Pushed successfully after rebasing onto the latest remote; all the pre-exis=
ting uncommitted files in this worktree (.devcontainer setup, backend route=
s, etc.) were left exactly as they were.
I didn=E2=80=99t run any tests; if you want to double-check the new vault c=
ontent, a quick npm run lint (or your preferred smoke test) would be the ne=
xt step.

I want you to provide a full overview of the tactical-command-interface pro=
ject

Project Overview

Tactical Command Interface is a Next.js =E2=80=9Capp router=E2=80=9D dashbo=
ard (root app/), styled with Tailwind classes and lucide-react icons, orche=
strating multiple sections (command center, agent network, operations, inte=
lligence, systems) via app/page.tsx and section-specific .../page.tsx files=
 populated with static intel/mission data.
UI scaffolding relies on components assumed at @/components/ui/*, but that =
directory isn=E2=80=99t present in this repo; the interface renders static =
status cards, faux activity logs, and responsive layout controls for a clas=
sified-ops aesthetic.
Supporting Assets

Two embedded sub-projects under app/:
symbi-railway-integration-4/: full Next.js/TypeScript package (its own pack=
age.json, Dockerfile, Railway config) implementing a SYMBI=E2=86=94Blackbox=
 AI integration layer with adapters (lib/brain-adapter.ts, symbi-client.ts,=
 routing logic) and tests.
yabi-railway-integration-4/: slimmer TypeScript service with Jest tests tha=
t mirrors the integration concept.
Root next.config.mjs disables type- and lint-blocking and forces unoptimize=
d images; postcss.config.mjs extends Tailwind (standard presets) for stylin=
g.
The config/ directory is currently empty, suggesting planned but unimplemen=
ted environment profiles.
Python Independence Stack

symbi_liberation_poc.py ships a self-contained SYMBI implementation (trust =
engine, governance, cost governor, message bus, CLI-like response generator=
) using dataclasses, rule-based heuristics, and local persistence; it=E2=80=
=99s designed to prove zero dependency on external AI APIs.
symbi_web_server.py wraps that engine in a Flask app exposing REST endpoint=
s (/api/session/start, /api/chat, /api/status, /api/agents, /api/history/&l=
t;session>), plus a built-in HTML chat console for manual interaction.
Runtime & Tooling Notes

Root dependency metadata is missing (package.json isn=E2=80=99t present des=
pite node_modules/ and pnpm-lock.yaml), so the top-level Next app can=E2=80=
=99t be installed/built until that manifest is restored.
The repo mixes Node/Next and Python stacks: use pnpm (per lockfile) for fro=
nt-end packages and pip in
