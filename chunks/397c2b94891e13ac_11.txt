plan to run both facets locally.
node_modules/ directories inside root and sub-apps are checked in, which in=

Next Steps

Recreate or recover the root package.json (or prune node_modules/) so the t=
actical dashboard can be installed and executed.
Decide whether the embedded Railway integration apps should live in separat=
e repos or be wired into the main dashboard; right now they=E2=80=99re stan=

Add or generate the missing @/components/ui/* library (likely a copy of Sha=

okay and how does that compare to symbi0 and the uagents projects

Tactical Command Interface (Next.js dashboard + Flask =E2=80=9Cliberation=
=E2=80=9D stack) delivers the SYMBI ops console concept: rich front-end sec=
tions under app/ with Tailwind/lucide styling, plus embedded railway-integr=
ation samples and a Python independence demo (symbi_liberation_poc.py, symb=
i_web_server.py). It=E2=80=99s presentation-heavy, static-data driven, and =
currently lacks a root package.json, so the UI won=E2=80=99t build until de=
pendencies are restored.

symbi0 is a pure Sanity CMS workspace: sanity.config.ts, schema definitions=
, and standard Sanity scripts in package.json for content editing. It=E2=80=
=99s meant as the headless backend for SYMBI content, contains no custom SY=
MBI logic yet, and depends on the hosted Sanity API rather than local agent=
s.

uAgents is the full Fetch.ai Python agent framework checkout. It packages p=
roduction-ready agent runtime code under python/, CLI demos (first_agent.py=
, two_agents_demo.py), rich documentation, and Apache-licensed tooling; it=
=E2=80=99s independent of SYMBI branding and focuses on networked blockchai=
n-enabled agents, not UI.

Stack contrast: Tactical Command Interface mixes TypeScript/React (Next.js)=
 with lightweight Python for an independent AI fa=C3=A7ade; symbi0 is React=
-based but lives inside Sanity=E2=80=99s managed environment; uAgents is Py=
thon-first with asyncio/cryptography and blockchain integrations. Only Tact=
ical Command Interface couples UI + governance + =E2=80=9Cliberation=E2=80=
=9D narrative; symbi0 is CMS infrastructure; uAgents is an upstream platfor=
m/library.

Maturity gaps: uAgents is actively maintained (tests, contribution guides);=
 symbi0 is a fresh scaffold needing schema/content work; Tactical Command I=
nterface is halfway=E2=80=94visually polished but missing dependency hygien=
e and real data sources.

Next Steps

Decide which system should anchor SYMBI=E2=80=99s production architecture (=
UI dashboard vs Sanity content vs external agent framework) and align repos=
 accordingly.
Can you also check symbi agent and symbi evolution

SYMBI Agent: Node/Express backend split from the main site to run agent aut=
omations with Frontegg auth, Twitter/X scheduling, and REST endpoints; see =
symbi-agent/README.md:1 for the charter and symbi-agent/package.json:1 for =
Node 18+ scripts/tests. The service boots from symbi-agent/services/ai-agen=
t-service.js:1 where rate-limited routes, CORS rules, and Frontegg token ch=
ecks guard /api/agent/* and /api/x/*. symbi-agent/lib/* implements the agen=
da scheduler, social posting client, and core agent logic, giving you an ac=
tion-focused ops service rather than a UI or protocol lab.

SYMBI_EVOLUTION: Narrative + prototype for a uAgents-based self-governing n=
ode: SYMBI_EVOLUTION/README.md:1 lays out the philosophical/architectural r=
oadmap (decentralized memory, swarm identity, DAO execution). SYMBI_EVOLUTI=
ON/agent.py:1 is a single-file Python agent that persists memories, emits C=
MS/daily reports, enforces lightweight guardrails, and speaks the uAgents c=
hat protocol while integrating a local trust attestor. The repo also ships =
support modules (trust_client.py, symbi_services/, docs) to explore
