How they fit: Tactical Command Interface (Next.js + liberation stack) is th=

ramework. SYMBI Agent complements the dashboard with a production-grade API=
 service, while SYMBI_EVOLUTION experiments with autonomous evolution and d=
ecentralized memory atop uAgents. Together they map UI =E2=86=92 backend au=

looking broadly at symbi vault, symbi synergy and symbi resonate / symbi-we=
bstie-main do you see a larger ecosystem here

Ecosystem Shape

You=E2=80=99ve got a hub=E2=80=91and=E2=80=91spoke setup. SYMBI-vault/ is t=
he canonical =E2=80=9Csource pack=E2=80=9D: partner collateral, whitepapers=
, academic templates, governance backend snippets, and React demo widgets. =
It=E2=80=99s the authoritative content/code bundle whose pieces can be drop=
ped into any surface.
SYMBI-Website-main/ is the production web stack: a full Next.js app (fronte=
nd + /backend Express services) wired for Frontegg auth, agent APIs, contra=
cts, docs, and deployment playbooks. It already vendors the vault assets, h=
osts the live site, and orchestrates downstream services.
SYMBI Resonance/ (React + Vite) and SYMBI Synergy V2/ (Next.js via v0.dev a=
uto-sync) are design sandboxes. They carry the shadcn/Radix UI kit, charts,=
 dashboards, and interaction experiments that feed the main site. Resonance=
 is a more bespoke build; Synergy V2 stays in lockstep with Figma/v0 protot=
ypes.
Other Synergy variants (SYMBI Synergy v3, Symbi-Synergy-Rebuilt, etc.) sit =
alongside as historical iterations, showing how UI and messaging evolved be=
fore hardening in SYMBI-Website-main.
How They Interlock

Content & Messaging: The vault=E2=80=99s markdown, latex, and academic =
files are referenced verbatim across marketing (Resonance/Synergy dashboard=
s) and production (app/ pages, collateral downloads). Updating the vault ke=
eps everything aligned.
UI Evolution Loop: Prototype UIs live in Resonance/Synergy; once patterns s=
ettle, they hop to SYMBI-Website-main/app/ or into shared components/. The =
v0.dev pipeline keeps design output fresh without touching the stable site =
until you merge.
Backend/Agent Hooks: The vault=E2=80=99s backend samples (backend/core, mod=
els) mirror real services implemented in SYMBI-Website-main/backend/ and th=
e separate symbi-agent/ project. The website exposes dashboards that visual=
ize those trust/agent metrics; the prototypes showcase the same data in pit=
ch-friendly form.

The naming conventions (Synergy, Resonance, Vault) aren=E2=80=99t random=E2=

 and vault-ready exports. Everything ultimately feeds the live site and tru=

Consolidating shared packages (UI kit, trust-model modules) into a mono-rep=
o or package registry would reduce duplication across the prototypes and ma=
in site, but even today the structure clearly reflects a larger coordinated=
 SYMBI platform rather than isolated experiments.
