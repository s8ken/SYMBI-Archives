Feeder Repositories in the Ecosystem

SYMBI-vault/ (now checked into SYMBI-Website-main/SYMBI-vault/) is the cano=
nical content/code bundle: partner packs, governance whitepapers, academic =
kits, LATEX sources, and reference implementations of the trust oracle, bon=
ds, React widgets, etc. Keeping these files authoritative means every downs=
tream surface stays on-message and on-model.
SYMBI-Website-main/ is the customer-facing Next.js monolith. It consumes va=
ult assets for marketing/whitepaper pages, hosts the backed-out Express ser=
vices, and aligns with the same trust APIs you see in SYMBI-SYNERGY. It=E2=
=80=99s the public gateway to the protocol.
Prototype labs (SYMBI Resonance/ Vite dashboard, SYMBI Synergy V2/ v0.dev a=
uto-sync, other Synergy iterations) are UX sandboxes that experiment with t=
he same data model before production hardening. They cycle concepts=E2=80=
=94metrics cards, CIQ dashboards, trust visualizations=E2=80=94into the mai=
n site and ultimately the enterprise UI.
Supporting backends (symbi-agent/, symbi-trust-protocol/, symbi_EVOLUTION/a=
gent.py) offer layered capabilities: a standalone agent/X scheduler service=
, the TypeScript/Python trust oracle primitives, and a uAgents-based self-g=
overning node with selective memory. Those projects supplied the schema, sc=
oring logic, and agent lifecycle concepts that the trust-oracle branch now =
embeds in SYMBI-SYNERGY.
Content/control infrastructure (symbi0 Sanity studio) keeps long-form copy,=
 blog posts, and static assets synchronized and ready to feed all propertie=
s.

) =E2=86=92 Enterprise platform (SYMBI-SYNERGY). The feat/trust-oracle-inte=

pliance-grade product with end-to-end receipts, bonding, scoring, and dashb=
oards.

ial Separation Strategy - September 2025

Executive Summary
Clear separation of SYMBI into academic (potentially not-for-profit) and co=
mmercial entities to maximize funding opportunities, protect IP, and enable=
 both research impact and commercial success. Immediate focus on available =
funding in Australia and Nordic countries, parallel Ansarada engagement for=
 seed funding, and DAO exploration for decentralized governance.
