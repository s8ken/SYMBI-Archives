 Resonance builds, Ent=
erprise platform, and upcoming DAO tooling.
Maintain academic/commercial separation visually (color coding, copy tone) =
while reinforcing they=E2=80=99re synchronized parts of the framework.
Implementation Notes

Use existing Vault markdown/whitepaper content via CMS bridge (Sanity or st=
atic MDX pipeline).
Lean on React components already in SYMBI-Website-main for trust receipts, =
dashboards; theme differently to emphasise neutrality/ethics focus.
Introduce a =E2=80=9CFunding Barometer=E2=80=9D component pulling from gran=
t trackers.
Ensure licensing & IP notices (CC BY-NC-SA vs proprietary) appear conte=
xtually.
That layout gives Gammatria a distinctive, research-first identity while ac=
ting as the navigation hub between the foundation, SYMBI-SYNERGY, and forth=
coming DAO=E2=80=94aligning perfectly with the separation plan.

Understood. Gammatria.com will be the 
ethics + academia pillar
 that governs, proves, and publis=
hes the SYMBI Framework=E2=80=94while cleanly routing visitors to the Vault=
 (canonical artifacts), Resonance (experiments), and the commercial surface=
 (SYMBI=E2=80=91SYNERGY). Below is a complete, execution=E2=80=91ready plan=
: information architecture, page-by-page scope, content model, governance, =
and a phased build.

1) Positioning & objectives

Role of Gammatria.com

Canon & governance
: Host ethics, governance, academic=
 posture, and standards.

Proof & replication
: Publish methods, preregistration=
, datasets, receipts, and CIQ metrics.

Separation guardrail
: Visually and legally separate 
Foundation (not=E2=80=91for=E2=80=91=
profit)
 from 
SYMBI=E2=
=80=91SYNERGY (commercial)
 and the 
future DAO
=E2=80=94with explicit hand=E2=80=91offs.

Gateway to Vault & Resonance
: Curate and deep=E2=80=
=91link to the canonical repo (Vault) and live experiments (Resonance) with=
out duplicating them.

Design cues

Theme: high-trust, research=E2=80=
=91grade.

Palette/Type (from Vault): 
Midnight / Ink / Slate / Cloud
 with=
 an Accent pulse; Inter Tight / Inter / JetBrains Mono for code.

Voice: precise, sovereign, protoco=
l=E2=80=91first; minimal flourish.
