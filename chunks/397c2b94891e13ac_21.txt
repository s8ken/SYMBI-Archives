Where to align (by purpose)

Linux Foundation (LF) =E2=80=93 project hosting (and LF AI & D=
ata).

LF offers a neutral home, legal/ops support, and ecosystem development; the=

an focus on code. LF Europe notes neutral IP/asset ownership and =E2=80=9Cn=
o-cost to your community=E2=80=9D core benefits (member sponsorship usually=
 underwrites ops). For AI/ML specifically, 
LF AI & Data
 provides charters, codes of conduct, =
neutrality statements, and mature governance templates you can adopt verbat=
