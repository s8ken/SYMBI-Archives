Got it. Here=E2=80=99s a clean, workable=
 path that preserves a 
sovereignt=
y coin with zero tradability
, keeps the 
commercial engine viable
, and gives you a 
mentor
 so you=E2=80=99re not=
 carrying the software side alone.

1) Sovereignty without speculation =
(the coin)

Design goal:
 governance + integrity only; no financial ri=
ghts, no trading, no sale.

Instrument:

N=
on-transferable governance units
 (NTGs). Earned via 
Trust Receipts
, peer review, and verified co=
ntributions. Can=E2=80=99t be sold, airdropped, or used as fees.

What NTGs can do

Parameter votes (policy thresholds, =
CIQ weights, reviewer rotations).

Delegate 
review authority
 (who audits, who can sign CIQ panels).

Gate 
maintainer powers
 (merge, release, constitution changes).

What NTGs cannot do

No dividends/buybacks/redemption; no=
 treasury claim; no access paywall.

Operator =E2=80=9CIntegrity Bonds=E2=80=9D (non-tradable)
=

Commercial operators post a 
slashable integrity bond
 (on-=
 or off-chain escrow) tied to compliance. If they breach Articles, a slice =
is slashed and reported. This creates skin-in-the-game 
without
 creating a tradable asset.

Compliance posture

Keep =E2=80=9Cparticipation only=
=E2=80=9D language everywhere.

Never bundle the coin with revenue=
 shares or =E2=80=9Cutility for discounts.=E2=80=9D

Use 
signed attestations
 for NTGs (soulbound semantics)=
 and publish revocation rules.

2) How the commercial side makes =
money (while core stays OSS)

Open-core + services
 that customers actually pay for=
=E2=80=94no token needed:

Managed SYMBI (SaaS/SLA):
 hosted /proof dashboards, SI=
EM export, DPA, regional hosting, incident SLAs.

CIQ Audits & Exec Readouts:
 fixed-fee assessments =
(pilot =E2=86=92 renewal plan).

Enterprise adapters:
 paid integrations (SIEM, CRM, doc=
 repos, auth).

Private Managed instances:
 hard security requirements,=
 bespoke controls.

Training & certification:
 rater training, operator=
 accreditation, =E2=80=9Ctrust-lead=E2=80=9D certificates.

Support contracts:
 LTS, security patches, architecture=
 reviews.

Dual-license where helpful:
 AGPL (community) + commerc=
ial license (for customers who can=E2=80=99t adopt AGPL).

Licensing guardrails

Code:
 AGPL or Apache-2.0 for core libraries; commercia=
l add-ons under EULA.

Trademarks:
 protect =E2=80=9CSYMBI=E2=80=9D/=E2=80=9CC=
IQ=E2=80=9D to prevent confusing forks in enterprise.

CLA or DCO:
 to keep IP clean for commercial licensing =
later.

3) =E2=80=9CCoin + license=E2=80=
=9D harmony (no trading, still licensable)

The 
coin (NTGs)
 is a 
governance artifact
=E2=80=94not licensed.

What you 
license
 are the 
commercial add-ons
