Run-down: NTG-first model vs the ea=
rlier DAO model

Dimension

Earlier DAO (trada=
ble / treasury-centric)

Proposed NTG-first (non-transferable governance units + integ=
rity bonds)

Token

Tr=
ansferable governance/utility token; liquid markets likely

Non-transferable
 Governance Units (NTGs) earned =
via Trust Receipts & peer review; 
no trading/sale

Sovereignty

Community control via tok=
en voting; risk of plutocracy/capture

H=
ouse of Work
 reputation + 
House of Stewardship
 veto on constitution/budget; NTGs + 
slashable integrity bonds
 f=
or operators; sovereignty anchored in verifiable work, not capital

Regulatory risk

Higher (financial instrument optics; exchange listings)

Lower (pa=
rticipation-only, no profit rights/redemption; =E2=80=9Csoulbound=E2=80=9D =
attestations)

Funding

Token sales/treasury, grants, sponsorships=

Grants + sponsorships + commercial r=
evenue
 (managed service, audits, adapters); optional restricted gr=
ants to Foundation

Enterprise fit

Some enterprises blocked by to=
ken exposure/legal

Enterprise-friendl=
y
 (no token on balance sheet; clear SLAs, DPA, SOC2 roadmaps)
=

Incentives

Speculation can crowd out research

Quality-only
 incentives (NTG issuance rules, peer-=
review; operator bonds tie revenue to integrity)

Decentralization=
 path

Faster symbolic decentralization, harder safety control

Measured decentralization
: off-chain a=
ttestations now; on-chain proofs/registries later, after PMF & governan=
ce hardening

Trademarks/IP

Ambiguous if treasury funds forks

Clear: 
core OSS
 (Apache/AGPL as=
 chosen), 
marks held
=
 by Foundation; commercial marks by SYMBI-SYNERGY

Time-to-opera=
te

Longer (tokenomics, legal, exchange risk)

Shorter: ship now; add DAO 
Phase 2
 once stable

Bottom line:
 ship 
NTG-first
 now (true sovereignty via earned reputation + =
operator bonds). Keep the 
DAO=
 as Phase 2
 (Q1=E2=80=93Q2=E2=80=9926) when the rules and threat m=
odels are proven.
