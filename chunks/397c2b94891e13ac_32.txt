## What =E2=80=9Csovereignty=E2=80=9D means to us

- **Non-transferable Governance Units (NTGs):** reputation you **earn** thr=
ough verifiable contributions.
- **Operator Integrity Bonds:** organizations that operate SYMBI at scale c=
ommit to enforceable standards.
- **Bicameral Safeguards:** proposals move through the House of Work and a =
Stewardship review with timelocks.
