cipation is the only path to voice.

## Non-transferable Governance Units (NTGs)

NTGs reflect your standing. They cannot be bought or sold.

### How you earn NTGs

| Contribution (evidence required) | Typical NTGs | Cooldown |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Validated Trust Receipts from a replication | 1=E2=80=935 | 7 days |
| Peer-review of a CIQ evaluation (accepted) | 2=E2=80=936 | 7 days |
| Accepted improvement to schemas/adapters | 3=E2=80=938 | 14 days |
| Ethics review participation (quorum met) | 2=E2=80=934 | 14 days |

**Evidence:** link a receipt hash, PR/commit, or review record.

### Decay & fairness

- NTGs **decay** over time without activity (gentle slope).
- Conflicts of interest =E2=86=92 **recusal required**.
- Bad-faith conduct =E2=86=92 **revocation** after due process.

## Operator Integrity Bonds

Operators who host or sell managed SYMBI services post a **bond** (escrow o=
r equivalent).

**Slashable events (examples):**
- scope/consent violation confirmed by receipts
- repeated failure to retain audit logs
- deceptive capability claims

**Due process:** notification =E2=86=92 7-day representation =E2=86=92 deci=
sion & appeal window =E2=86=92 public register update.

## Bicameral governance in brief

- **House of Work (HoW):** reputation-weighted signaling; open to contribut=
ors.
- **House of Stewardship (HoS):** narrow veto on constitution, budget, and =
security.

**Flow:** proposal =E2=86=92 HoW soft-vote =E2=86=92 HoS review =E2=86=92 t=
imelock =E2=86=92 execute.

## Why no token sale?

- Avoids speculation and capture =20
- Simplifies compliance and enterprise adoption =20
- Keeps voice tied to work, not capital

# Economic Constitution

This document defines the economic rules of the SYMBI Framework. It is **pu=
blic, versioned, and amendable** through governance.

## Scope

- NTG issuance & decay =20
- Operator Integrity Bonds & slashing =20
- Public-goods budget targets =20
- Amendment thresholds

## Issuance (NTGs)

NTGs follow contributions evidenced by **Trust Receipts**, peer-review reco=
rds, or accepted protocol improvements.

### Receipt-based issuance

Let `=CE=94CIQ` be the improvement over a directive baseline on a public ta=
sk set:

- **Threshold:** award if `=CE=94CIQ =E2=89=A5 =CF=84` (published per task =
family)
- **Scale:** `NTG =3D round(k * =CE=94CIQ)` within a published band
- **Quality gates:** no critical safety flags; reproducible by at least one=
 peer

### Peer-review & standards work

Accepted reviews and standards contributions award fixed bands with cooldow=
ns to limit gaming. Multipliers apply for difficult or high-impact work.

## Decay & penalties

- **Time decay:** NTGs decay by a small percentage per quarter without acti=
vity.
- **Incident penalties:** confirmed violations reduce NTGs; severe cases tr=
igger revocation per due process.

## Operator Integrity Bonds

**Bands:** Small / Standard / Large (published annually). =20
**Slashing:** percentage range by violation class with a default restitutio=
n path. =20
**Appeals:** single appeal within 14 days; outcomes logged to a public regi=
ster.

## Public-goods allocation

Target ratios (guidance, not entitlement):

- 40% core maintenance & security
- 25% replication & audits
- 20% accessibility & education
- 10% research collaborations
- 5% emergency reserve

Quarterly reports include spend categories, receipts, and learnings.

## Amendments

- Constitutional sections: **2/3 HoW** + **HoS confirmation**, 30-day timel=
ock
- Parameter updates (e.g., `=CF=84`, `k`): **simple HoW majority**, 7-day t=
imelock
- All amendments publish a diff and rationale
