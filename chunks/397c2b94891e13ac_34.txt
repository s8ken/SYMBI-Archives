# Replication Kit

Reproduce our results on your machine. Export **Trust Receipts**. Share wha=
t you learn.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the starter and install dependencies =20
2. Run `/proof` mode (Directive =E2=86=94 SYMBI) on the sample tasks =20
3. Export receipts (JSON + PDF) and submit your summary

> We provide small, well-documented datasets and baseline expectations t=
o keep this accessible for all skill levels.

## The `/proof` demo

- Toggle **Directive =E2=86=94 SYMBI** on identical tasks =20
- See **CIQ** subscales (clarity, breadth, safety, completion) =20
- Download **Receipts** (hash-chained; signed)

## Challenge datasets

- **Dataset A (Support triage):** expected `=CE=94CIQ` band: 0.12=E2=80=930=
.25 =20
- **Dataset B (RFP snippets):** expected `=CE=94CIQ` band: 0.08=E2=80=930.1=
8

We=E2=80=99ll list replicators (opt-in) and badges for independent confirma=
tions.

## Receipt schema (short)

- session id, mode, inputs, constraints =20
- outcome metrics and flags =20
- `ciq` object with subscale scores =20
- hash chain + signature

Full JSON: link to spec and examples.

## Ethics notes

- Data minimization; no PII exfiltration =20
- Clear rater instructions; bias checks; disallowed content policy

## Submit results

Use the form to upload your summary (or PR a report). We=E2=80=99ll review =
within two weeks.

# Governance

We use a bicameral model designed for openness, safety, and long-term stewa=
rdship.

## Houses

- **House of Work (HoW):** reputation-weighted signaling based on NTGs =20
- **House of Stewardship (HoS):** narrow veto on constitution, budget, and =
security

## Proposal lifecycle

1. Draft a proposal (template provided) =20
2. HoW soft-vote window opens (e.g., 7=E2=80=9314 days) =20
3. HoS review for constitutional, budget, and security issues =20
4. Timelock (7=E2=80=9330 days depending on impact) =20
5. Execute and publish receipts

## Safeguards

- Quorums and supermajorities for constitutional changes =20
- Emergency sunset procedures =20
- Public change logs and receipts for decisions

## Reputation mechanics

- NTGs are earned, decay with inactivity, and subject to revocation for mis=
conduct =20
- Conflicts of interest =E2=86=92 recusal =20
- Reviewer rotation to avoid bottlenecks

## Public registers

- Decisions & diffs =20
- Violations & appeals (redacted when required) =20
- Treasury summaries

# Funding & Partnerships

We welcome grants and sponsorships that support the **public good**=E2=80=
=94not control.

## How to support

- **Grants:** research, replication, accessibility =20
- **Sponsorships:** feature bounties, education, security hardening =20
- **In-kind:** datasets, evaluation time, accessibility reviews

> Sponsors are acknowledged publicly. Sponsorship does **not** confer go=
vernance power.

## Grants dashboard

We track programs (AU/Nordics/EU) with =E2=80=9Cas-of=E2=80=9D dates and st=
