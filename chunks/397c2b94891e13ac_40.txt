6) Commit + push

bash

Copy code

git add .
git commit -m 

"Add sovereignty, ec=
onomic-constitution, replication, governance, funding, RFC pages + proof de=
mo"

git push

7) If the VS Code =E2=80=9Clink=
=E2=80=9D feels ambiguous

In VS Code, make sure you=E2=80=99=
ve 
opened the correct folder
 (File =E2=86=92 Open Folder=E2=80=A6) and you see the 
app/
 directory in the Explorer.

Trust the workspace when prompted.=

Install recommended extensions (MD=
X/TypeScript).

If a dev server is already running=
, stop and restart after adding MDX.

8) Launch the =E2=80=9Caccessible=
 for everyone=E2=80=9D touchpoints

Record three 
90-second tours
 (Sovereignty, Replication=
, Financial Framework) using QuickTime =E2=86=92 screen + mic; drop videos =
in 
public/
 and embed at =
the top of each page.

Add a 
SYMBI 101
 micro-course as 
app/learn/lesson-1..6/page.mdx
 (use the 6-less=
on outline we gave).

Post two 
challenge datasets
 in 
public/datasets/
 and link from 
/replication
.

Add a simple 
Open Call
 banner with date/time to 
/rfc
.

If you want, paste me your project=
 root (folder names + files) and I=E2=80=99ll tell you exactly where each s=
nippet should go line-by-line.

Yep=E2=80=94I can see you=E2=80=99re in 
symbi-trust-protocol/src/core/trustOracle.js
. That=E2=80=99s the backend library. To =E2=80=9Cnavigate to a specif=
ic page,=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99ll want to jump into the 
Next.js website repo
 (the one that serve=
s /sovereignty, /replication, etc.), not the trust-protocol package.

Here=E2=80=99s the quickest way forw=
ard:

If you want to view a SITE PAGE (e.=
g., /sovereignty)

/** you need the Next.js repo open &=
amp; running **/

Open the website folder in VS Code

VS Code =E2=86=92 
File =E2=86=92 Add Folder to Workspace=E2=80=A6
 =E2=86=92 select your Next.js site (e.g., 
gammatria
 or 
SYMBI-Website-main
).

Keep 
symbi-trust-protocol
 in the workspace too; that=E2=80=
=99s fine.

Run the dev server

VS Code Terminal in the website fold=
er:

b=
ash

Copy code

pnpm dev

Open your browser:

http://localhost:3000/sovereignty

http://localhost:3000/economic-constitution

http://localhost:3000/replication

http://localhost:3000/governance

http://localhost:3000/funding

http://localhost:3000/rfc

(symbi.world repo) 
http://localhost:3000/financial-framework

Open the page file fast (in VS Code)

Press 
=E2=8C=98P
 and type: 
app/sovereignty/page.mdx
 (or any of the routes abov=
e).

If the file doesn=E2=80=99t exist =
yet, create it at that path and paste the MDX we prepared.

If you want to jump around INSIDE=
 the trust oracle code (what you=E2=80=99re viewing now)

Go to function
: 
=E2=87=A7=E2=8C=98O
 =E2=86=92 type 
checkBoundaries
 / 
createTrustMiddleware
 to jump.

Go to line
: 
=E2=8C=83G
 =E2=86=92 enter line number.

Find across repo
: 
=E2=8C=98=E2=87=A7F
 =E2=86=92 search for 
createTrustMiddleware
 or 
TRUST_ARTICLES
.

Peek definition
: right-click symbol =E2=86=92 
Peek Definition
.

Handy multi-repo setup (so you ca=
n flip between code & pages)

In VS Code Explorer, you should se=
e 
both folders
:

symbi-trust-protocol/
 (backend lib you=E2=80=99re in now)

gammatria/
 or 
=
SYMBI-Website-main/
 (Next.js site)

Use terminals per folder (split te=
rminal) so one runs 
pnpm dev
 (site) while you edit the oracle or MDX.

If you tell me which site folder n=
ame you see in your Explorer, I=E2=80=99ll point you to the exact 
app/.../page.mdx
 path for the pag=
e you want.
