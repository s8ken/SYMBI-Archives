I only see the file that=E2=80=99s 
focused in your active VS Code window
 under the =E2=80=9CWork with code=E2=80=9D integration. To change wh=
at I can see, just focus a different file in that same window.

Quick ways to do that on Mac:

Open from Explorer:

=E2=8C=98=E2=87=A7E
 to focus Explorer =E2=86=92 click the file =
you want me to view.

Quick Open:

=E2=
=8C=98P
 =E2=86=92 type the path/name (e.g. 
src/app/sovereignty/page.mdx
) =E2=86=92 Enter.

Switch tabs:
 click the tab of the file you want me to see=
 (the focused tab is what I receive).

Add a different project:
 File =E2=86=92 
Add Folder to Workspace=E2=80=A6
 (e.g.,=

/Users/admin/gammatria/gammatria=
-site
) =E2=86=92 open a file there and focus it.

From Terminal:

=
code src/app/sovereignty/page.mdx
 (opens & focuses it).

Tips:

If you have 
multiple VS Code windows
, the integration foll=
ows the one where you opened the =E2=80=9CWork with code=E2=80=9D tab=E2=80=
=94make sure you focus files in that window.

Very large files (like 
package-lock.json
) may be heavy; if yo=
u want me to review something specific, open a 
smaller source file
 or the exact page (e.g., 
src/app/replication/page.tsx
) and I=E2=80=99ll respond to that.

If you want me to look at 
multiple files
, open each on=
e and focus it when you want feedback on that file.

If you tell me which page you want=
 to work on next (e.g., 
src/app=
/sovereignty/page.mdx
), put that file in focus now and I=E2=80=99ll =
dive right in.

Thought for 25s

yep =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99m seeing =
your 
package-lock.json
 f=
or 
gammatria-site
. Key takea=
ways from what=E2=80=99s open:

Next 
15.5.4
, React 
19.1.0
, Tailwind 
=
4.x
 =E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F

No MDX deps yet
 (
@next/mdx
, 
@mdx-js/react=

 aren=E2=80=99t in the lock)

You=E2=80=99re on 
npm
 (lockfile v3). Earlier we used 
pnpm
 commands=E2=80=94let=E2=80=
=99s stick to 
npm
 here=
 to avoid conflicts.

here=E2=80=99s the fastest path to g=
et MDX pages live and the server running on a clean port:

1) stay on npm + run on 3001

b=
ash

Copy code

# from /Users/admin/gammat=
ria/gammatria-site

npm run dev -- --port 3001

# (or add a script)

=

npm pkg 

set

 =
scripts.dev:3001=3D

"next dev -p 30=
01"

npm run dev:3001

2) add MDX support

b=
ash

Copy code

npm i @next/mdx @mdx-js/react

Create or edit 
next.config.mjs
:

Copy code

// next.config.mjs

(Optional wrapper)

Wrap root layout:

tsx

Copy code

// src/app/layout.tsx

import

'./globals.css'

;

import

 { 

WithMDX

 } 

from

'./mdx-components'

;

export

return

"antialiased"

<

}

3) drop in the MDX
