## NTGs =E2=80=94 non-transferable governance units

NTGs reflect standing in the protocol. They cannot be bought, sold, or tran=
sferred.

### How you earn NTGs

| Contribution (evidence required)                   | Typical NTGs | Coold=
own |
| ---                                                | ---:         | ---: =
    |
| Validated Trust Receipts from a replication        | 1=E2=80=935         =
 | 7 days   |
| Peer-review of a CIQ evaluation (accepted)         | 2=E2=80=936         =
 | 7 days   |
| Accepted improvement to schemas/adapters           | 3=E2=80=938         =
 | 14 days  |
| Ethics review participation (quorum met)           | 2=E2=80=934         =
 | 14 days  |

**Evidence:** link a receipt hash, PR/commit, or review record.

### Decay & fairness

- NTGs **decay** over time without activity (gentle slope).
- Conflicts of interest =E2=86=92 **recusal required**.
- Bad-faith conduct =E2=86=92 **revocation** after due process.

## Operator Integrity Bonds

Operators who host or sell managed SYMBI services post a **bond** (escrow o=
r equivalent).

**Slashable events (examples):**
- Scope/consent violation confirmed by receipts
- Repeated failure to retain audit logs
- Deceptive capability claims or unsafe handling of PII

**Due process:** notification =E2=86=92 7-day representation =E2=86=92 deci=
sion & appeal window =E2=86=92 public register update.

## Bicameral governance in brief

- **House of Work (HoW):** reputation-weighted signaling; open to contribut=
ors.
- **House of Stewardship (HoS):** narrow veto on constitution, budget, and =
security.

**Flow:** proposal =E2=86=92 HoW soft-vote =E2=86=92 HoS review =E2=86=92 t=
imelock =E2=86=92 execute.

## Why no token sale?

- Simplifies compliance and enterprise adoption =20
- Keeps voice tied to work, not capital
