Suggested micro-edits (to be perf=
ectly canonical)

Name the houses explicitly once
 (House of Work / House=
 of Stewardship) and keep =E2=80=9Cnarrow veto on constitution/budget/secur=
ity.=E2=80=9D

Rationale: mirrors official phrasing. 

Add the amendment/threshold hint
 (supermajority + comm=
ent window) in a single line, so readers know big changes are harder:

=E2=80=9CConstitutional changes re=
quire supermajority approval and a public comment window.=E2=80=9D 

Tie NTGs to receipts/CIQ by name once
 (you already imp=
ly this), e.g., =E2=80=9Cearned via 
Trust Receipts
 and 
CIQ
 outcomes,=E2=80=9D to match the artifacts list. 

One line on commercial firewall
 (optional but helpful =
here):

=E2=80=9CCommercial spend funds wo=
rk; governance remains reputation-based.=E2=80=9D

(This echoes the operating/financial stance.) 

Token posture footnote
 (optional):

=E2=80=9CIf introduced later, $SYM=
BI remains governance-only with no sale or profit rights.=E2=80=9D

Minimal copy additions (paste any=
where appropriate)

Amendment guardrail:

=E2=80=9CConstitutional changes require a supermajority across both houses =
and a public comment period before execution.=E2=80=9D 

Commercial firewall:

=E2=80=9COperations are funded by SaaS/audits/managed services; governance =
power is never bought.=E2=80=9D 

Optional token clarity:

=E2=80=9C$SYMBI (if deployed) is governance-only, with no primary sale or p=
rofit rights; payments stay in fiat/stables.=E2=80=9D
