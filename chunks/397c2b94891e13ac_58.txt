with the sets above. No code changes required.

5) Quick QA

bash

Copy code

npm run dev -- --port 3001

/governance
 and 
/replication
: ToC shows links for each 
h2
/
h3
 and jumps correctly.

=E2=80=9CSee also=E2=80=9D blocks =
render with internal links (and the external financial-framework link where=
 applicable).

the NTG model seems g=

Great instinct. NTGs aren=E2=80=99t just =E2=80=

SYMBI cross the river from today=E2=80=99s trust-governed project to a sove=
reign protocol tomorrow, without introducing speculation or capture.

Here=E2=80=99s the clean path.

How NTGs lead to sovereignty (witho=
ut speculation)

1) Reputation is the substrate

NTGs =3D verifiable work
: earned from Trust Receipts, CIQ=
 reviews, accepted specs/adapters. They decay, can be revoked, and are non-=
transferable.

Because NTGs are 
evidence-backed and soulbound
, they=E2=80=99re ha=
rder to game than capital or social clout=E2=80=94and that=E2=80=99s exactl=
y what you want for sovereign control.

2) Bicameral control today

House of Work (HoW)
 uses NTGs for signaling, quorum, and =
supermajority thresholds.

House of Stewardship (HoS)
 has a narrow veto (constitutio=
n/budget/security) with timelocks and public receipts.

This already 
is
 a sovereign decision flow=E2=80=94just off-chain a=
nd low-friction.

3) Operator Integrity Bonds =3D sk=
in in the game

Operators post 
slashable bonds
 (escrow/off-chain init=
ially). Breaches proven via receipts trigger slashing.

That ties economic incentives to t=
he constitution

 selling a token.

Progressive Sovereignty: Phase pl=
an

Think in 
phases with explicit readiness gates
. NTGs st=
ay the authority; what changes is 
how
 we attest and execute.

Phase 0 =E2=80=94 Reputation OS (=
current)

NTGs, HoW/HoS, bonds, public RFCs,=
 replication.

Readiness gates
: 3+ releases governed by NTGs; 2+ inde=
pendent replications per release; one full bond-slash case exercised with d=
ue process.

Phase 1 =E2=80=94 Attested Govern=
ance (off-chain, signed)

NTGs & votes recorded as 
signed receipts
 (hash-cha=
ined, timestamped).

A minimal 
registry
 publishes: proposals, tallies, stew=
ard rulings, and change receipts.

Gates
: reproducible tallies; appeals process works; no=
 single actor >20% NTG influence within any 90 days (with decay).

Phase 2 =E2=80=94 On-chain Regist=
ry (no treasury, no token sale)

Mirror NTG tallies as 
soulbound attestations
 on-chain =
(e.g., SBT/attestation registry).

Executable specs
: parameter changes emitted as on-chai=
n =E2=80=9Cgovernance receipts,=E2=80=9D but execution still happens in cod=
e repos and managed services.

Operator bonds can move to 
on-chain escrows
 with progr=
ammatic slashing keyed to published violation receipts.

Gates
: 3 successful cycles recorded on-chain; cross-ch=
eck between off-chain votes and on-chain mirror <1% discrepancy.

Phase 3 =E2=80=94 Sovereign Execu=
