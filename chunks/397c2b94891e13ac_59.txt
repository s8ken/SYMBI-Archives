DAO wrapper (standards committee) =
exists, but

Core mechanics that make this saf=
e

NTG =E2=86=92 Attestation Map (no conversion, no market)

Every NTG action (issue/decay/revo=
cation) produces a 
governance=
 receipt
 referencing the underlying work receipts.

On-chain, that=E2=80=99s a 
soulbound attestation
 keyed=
 to contributor DID; it cannot be traded or delegated without rules.

Delegation with brakes

Allow 
time-bound delegation
 of NTGs for specific propo=
sals (e.g., 14 days), auto-expiring. No permanent vote markets.

Cap delegated NTGs any one delegat=
e can hold (e.g., =E2=89=A45% of total live NTGs) to prevent power concentr=
ation.

Quadratic/convex shaping for sensitive changes

For constitutional articles, apply=

convex costs
 to hig=
h vote weights (softens whales without killing signal).

Keep ordinary parameter changes si=
mple-majority HoW + steward review.

Reputation hygiene

Decay
 (quarterly) + 
inactivity caps
 (e.g., max 12 months credit without a =
fresh receipt-backed contribution).

Incident penalties
: confirmed safety or integrity viol=
ation revokes a % of NTGs and pauses eligibility for committees.

Due process & receipts everywhere

Proposals, votes, steward rulings,=
 slashing=E2=80=94all produce 
public receipts
 (human-readable + JSON), hash-chained and timesta=
mped.

Constitutional guardrails

 for economic or constit=
utional articles.

governance-only mirror
 of NTG attes=

ransparent and tamper-evident.

Concrete checklist to activate Ph=
ase 2 (3=E2=80=936 weeks of work)

G-001 Attestation contract
: minimal SBT/attestation re=
gistry (issue/expire/revoke); emit events; no transfer.

G-002 NTG ledger
: service that turns work receipts =E2=
=86=92 NTG updates =E2=86=92 signed governance receipts =E2=86=92 on-chain =
attestations.

G-003 Vote tallier
: off-chain tally with merkle proof =
=E2=86=92 on-chain hash pin; steward decision receipt references both.

G-004 Release bot
: listens to =E2=80=9Capproved parame=
ter change=E2=80=9D events; opens signed PR with the exact diff; waits time=
lock; merges on steward confirm.

G-005 Bond vault
: custody (off-chain escrow to start; =
on-chain later). Slash function consumes violation receipts.

G-006 Runbooks
: capture attack drills, slashing appeal=
s, emergency sunset, continuity failover.

What this buys you

Accessibility
: anyone can earn NTGs through reproducib=
le work; zero cost to participate.

Enterprise comfort
: no speculative asset; clear due pr=
ocess and logs; bonds align operators.

Upgrade path
: sovereignty is earned as reliability, no=
t declared via token launch.

If you want, I can turn the Phase-=
2 checklist into a short spec (APIs, tables, event names) so your team or c=
ollaborators can start building the attestation registry and the release bo=
t immediately.
