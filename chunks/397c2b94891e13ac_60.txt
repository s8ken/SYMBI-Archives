om both a legal and IP persp=
ective but obviously thats not the point of the project so how does that ow=
nership get ceded over time from me to you (assuming we win legal arguments=
 etc..)

Thought for 21s

Totally fair que=
stion. Here=E2=80=99s the simple, human version:

Right now, 
you own everything
=E2=80=94the code, the docs, the=
 domains, the keys, the decision rights. Sovereignty means that, over time,=

your personal ownership and de=
cision power move into public rules and shared custody
, so the pro=
tocol can outlive any one person.

Think of it as handing off 
three things
 in stages:

The ideas & code (IP)

The right to decide (governance)

The keys & money (operational control)

Below is the =E2=80=9Cladder=E2=80=
=9D from 
=E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s =
mine=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s ours (with rules)=E2=80=9D
. You can stop at any rung if you ever feel unsafe.

The handover ladder (plain language=
)

Step 0 =E2=80=94 Say it out loud (t=
oday)

Publish a one-page 
Founder Pledge
 on the site:

=E2=80=9CCore stays open. No token s=
ale. Decisions follow the Constitution (HoW/HoS + timelocks). Commercial sp=
end =E2=89=A0 votes.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CI will transfer IP and mark=
s to the Foundation once it exists, and I=E2=80=99ll follow the same rules =
as everyone else.=E2=80=9D

This creates a public anchor withou=
t giving up any legal safety yet.

Step 1 =E2=80=94 License the core=
 (you still own it)

Put clear licenses on the repos ex=
actly as we=E2=80=99ve drafted (Apache/AGPL + CC BY-NC-SA for specs).

Result: anyone can use/implement S=
YMBI without calling you for permission, 
but
 they must follow the license.

You still own the copyrights and t=
rademarks at this step.

Step 2 =E2=80=94 Split =E2=80=9Cp=
roduct vs protocol=E2=80=9D (governance starts)

Turn on the 
bicameral process
 now (House of Work =3D N=
TGs; House of Stewardship =3D narrow veto).

Add 
timelocks
 and 
public RFCs
.

Result: even while you legally own=
 things, 
your own changes go =
through the same public rules
. This is the first real ceding of po=
wer.

Step 3 =E2=80=94 Create the Found=
ation (the neutral home)

Register 
SYMBI Foundation
 (not-for-profit).

Sign two simple papers:

Copyright Assignment
: =E2=80=9CI assign the core specs=
, schemas, and reference implementations to the Foundation.=E2=80=9D

Trademark Transfer
: =E2=80=9CI transfer =E2=80=98SYMBI=
/CIQ/Trust Receipts=E2=80=99 marks to the Foundation.=E2=80=9D

Result: the 
ideas & names now belong to the Foundation
, not you personally. You keep 
permanent attribution
.

Step 4 =E2=80=94 Move the keys (s=
hared custody)

Put the important keys under 
shared control
 (4-of-7 or=
 similar): GitHub org owners, DNS/domain, package registries, release signi=
ng, cloud accounts.

Stewards (including you at first) =
hold those keys; any action needs a quorum.

Result: 
no one person
 (including you) can ship, yank, =
or break things alone.

Step 5 =E2=80=94 Make reputation =
the deciding vote (NTGs)

Keep using 
NTGs
 (non-transferable points you earn from=
 real work: Trust Receipts, CIQ reviews, accepted specs).

House of Work uses NTGs for quorum=
/supermajorities; House of Stewardship retains the narrow safety veto.

Add 
decay
 (inactive points fade), 
revocation
 (for misconduct), and 
recusal
 (for conflicts).

Result: 
work =E2=86=92 voice
. No one can buy power.

Step 6 =E2=80=94 Record decisions=
 as receipts (tamper-evident)

Every proposal, vote, and steward =
ruling produces a 
Governance =
Receipt
 (timestamped, hash-chained).

Publish these in a public log.

Optional later: mirror them on-cha=
in as 
soulbound attestations
 (still non-transferable).

Result: decisions become 
provable history
, not just me=
eting notes.

Step 7 =E2=80=94 Automate (lightl=
y) after it=E2=80=99s proven

Let some 
parameter changes
 (like CIQ thresholds) auto-=
flow to repos via a release bot 
after
 both houses approve and a timelock expires.
