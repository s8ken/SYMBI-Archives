Where you still fit in (and how y=

You stay a steward at first
 with a fixed term (e.g., 1=
2=E2=80=9318 months) and then rotate like everyone else.

Your name stays on the work
 (moral rights/attribution =
never go away).

You keep a paying role
 either in the commercial compan=
y (audits/managed service) or the Foundation (research lead). This way, 
your livelihood doesn=E2=80=99t =

The simplest way to start (next 3=

Post the Founder Pledge
 and the

Activate public RFCs + timelocks

Pick initial stewards
 (3=E2=80=935 people you trust) a=

Open the Foundation file
 (start entity setup; assignme=

Share keys
 on the least risky fronts first (e.g., webs=

Why this benefits 
you

Legitimacy & adoption:
 neutral governance removes =E2=
=80=9Cvendor risk,=E2=80=9D unlocking enterprises, universities, and public=
 funding that won=E2=80=99t follow a single founder.

Bigger pie, less liability:
 the Foundation carries standa=
rds & marks; your commercial arm focuses on revenue (audits, managed se=
rvice). Cleaner legal posture for you personally.

Funding surface area:
 grants + sponsorships flow to a neu=
tral home; customers pay the company; both can pay you (PI on grants; lead =
auditor; steward honoraria).

Time leverage:
 decisions come from published rules (NTGs =
+ bicameral), not from you being in every thread.

Career optionality:
 founder-credit stays; you keep a stew=
ard seat (term-limited), paid roles (research lead, chief auditor), speakin=
g/teaching.

Legacy & resilience:
 if you step back, the protoco=
l keeps moving=E2=80=94and your name stays on the masthead.

This isn=E2=80=99t new (who=E2=80=
=99s walked this path)
