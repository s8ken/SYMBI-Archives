=
You=E2=80=99re right to guard two things at once: (1) we must be investable=
 from day one, and (2) we have to bring non-AI folks along. Here=E2=80=99s =
the compact playbook that does both=E2=80=94no backpedal on sovereignty/NTG=

1) Investor-ready framing (without =

The story (short)

Category:

auditability, safety, ROI proof).

Product:
 Open-core 
/proof + Trust Receipts + CIQ audits
; paid

enterprise adapters
,

.

Why we win:
 Neutral standard (Foundation) + receipts netw=
ork + compliance-grade ops (SYMBI-SYNERGY).

Regulatory advantage:
 No token sale; governance via 
NTGs
; enterprise-safe.

Moat:
 Standards leadership, certification program, SIEM i=

warded trademarks (SYMBI, CIQ, Trust Receipts).

Design-partners / letters of intent:

ear use cases (support triage, RFP, incident post-mortems).

Time-to-value:
 PoC =E2=86=92 
Board-ready CIQ Audit in 4 weeks
.

Metrics:
 =E2=89=A515% uplift in =E2=89=A52 metrics (co=
mpletion, time-to-task, escalations, safety) shown via receipts.

Revenue lines live:
 Pilot $25k/4w; Managed $60k-$250k/=
yr; Pro $29=E2=80=93$49/u/mo or $0.50=E2=80=93$2/1k; CIQ audits $5k/$15k/$5=

Referenceable security posture:

 audit logs, regional hosting, DPA/SOC2/ISO roadmap.

 a doc)

Problem:
 Agents wow; renewals demand measured uplift +=
 governable safety.

Solution:

Why now:
 AI adoption collides with compliance; boards =
demand receipts, not decks.

Business model:
 Open-core + audits + managed service +=
 enterprise adapters + training.
