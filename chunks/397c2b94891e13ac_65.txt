Here=E2=80=99s a tight plan with cop=
y you can drop in today.

Make the rebellion unforkable

1) Add =E2=80=9CPublic-Purpose &=
; Red Lines=E2=80=9D to the Constitution

So it isn=E2=80=99t negotiable in ba=
ck rooms.

## Public-Purpose & Red Lines

Our purpose is public: make human=E2=80=93AI collaboration measurably safer=
 and more useful for everyone.

**We will not:**
- Sell governance power or introduce speculation into participation.
- Paywall the protocol, schemas, or verification tools.
- Hide safety incidents or governance decisions from the public record.
- Accept funding conditioned on content control, surveillance misuse, or ex=
clusionary access.
- Ship changes without receipts, review, and a public timelock.

These guardrails require **supermajority** approval across both houses to a=
mend and a **public 30-day comment** window.

2) Publish a Manifesto (short, pl=
ain, public)

Create

src=
/app/manifesto/page.mdx
:

mdx

Copy code

export const metadata =3D {
  title: 'SYMBI Manifesto =E2=80=94 Rebel with Receipts',
  description: 'Why we exist and what we refuse to compromise.',
};

# Rebel with Receipts

The system didn=E2=80=99t fail because people didn=E2=80=99t care; it faile=
d because outcomes weren=E2=80=99t measured and power wasn=E2=80=99t accoun=
table. =20
SYMBI=E2=80=99s bet: **relationships over raw computation** and **receipts =
over rhetoric**.

- **Everyone can verify.** Core protocol, schemas, and the /proof toggle ar=
e free.
- **Voice is earned.** Non-transferable governance units (NTGs) reflect rea=
l work=E2=80=94never money.
- **Power has brakes.** Bicameral review, timelocks, and public receipts fo=
r every decision.
- **Operators are accountable.** Integrity bonds and due process, in public=
.
- **No speculation.** No token sale; governance remains participation-only.

**If we ever drift, pull us back.** File an RFC, challenge a receipt, call =
us to the Open Call=E2=80=94then check the log to see what changed.

3) Ring-fence money for the commo=
ns (visible to all)
