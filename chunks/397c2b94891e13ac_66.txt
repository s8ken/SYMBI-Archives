 Turn on 
=E2=80=9CRebel =
mode=E2=80=9D
 (simple UI switch showing governance receipts + diff=
s).

 Add a 
Manifesto link
 to the site header.

Why this balances rebellion + via=
bility

It 
locks the principles into law
 (constitution), not j=
ust vibes.

It 
pays people
 who aren=E2=80=99t engineers to partici=
pate=E2=80=94so the conversation stays human.

It 
comforts enterprises & investors
 with proof (re=
ceipts) and guardrails (bonds, timelocks).

It keeps the 
north star visible
 while we use existing =
rails to get there.

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll also han=
d you a one-page 
Founder Pled=
ge
 you can post next to the manifesto (plain English, no-lawyer re=
quired) and a 60-minute 
Teach=
-in run sheet
 (slides + script) so anyone can host the first sessi=
on.
