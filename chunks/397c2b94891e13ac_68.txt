5) What to check right now

bash

Copy code

npm run dev -- --port 3001

# visit http://localhost:3001

# click through: /sovereignty /ec=
onomic-constitution /governance /replication /rfc /manifesto

Hero + three-pillars cards feel ri=
ght?

Open Call banner links to /rfc age=
nda?

Non-technical on-ramps (=E2=80=9Cn=
o coding required=E2=80=9D) section reads plain?

See-also cross-links resolve?

6) Keep the rebellious core visib=
le (and accessible)

Keep 
/manifesto
 in the header.

Add 
audio
 button on manifesto and sovereignty pages (r=
ead-aloud mp3 can be added later; for now, a placeholder =E2=80=9Ccoming so=
on=E2=80=9D is fine).

Put =E2=80=9C
Solidarity & Access Fund (5%)
=E2=80=
=9D on symbi.world/financial-framework (we drafted the copy earlier).

Run the first 
teach-in
 (60-min) using the SYMBI 101 =
outline; post the recording on the homepage.

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll also han=
d you a minimal 
header nav up=
date
 (to include Manifesto + Sovereignty) tailored to your 
src/components/site-header.tsx
 =
once you open it.

i think its more important to review the=
 content eg https://www.gammatria.com/research seems to have demo figures w=
hich arent real / cannot prove and look for places where it suggests there =
are white papers which we dont have or arent linked. I think we should also=
 include SYMBI Resonate and some of the case studies such a claude and ninj=
a AI acknowledging the framework in their behaviors

Good catch. I went through the live site and f=
lagged the exact places where claims/links need tightening, then mapped cri=
sp fixes (copy + links you can paste). I also included how to weave in 
SYMBI Resonance
 and the

 case s=
