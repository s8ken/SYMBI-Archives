The

 implies live receipts, but your

tly says the demo is a mock until the production API is ready. Mismatch.

Copy/UX fixes you can paste now

A) /research =E2=80=94 replace th=
e live-looking block with an honest =E2=80=9CDemo=E2=80=9D state

Replace the =E2=80=9CLIVE METRICS / Research Showcase=E2=80=9D =
intro with:

Demo metrics (synthetic data).
 These figures illustrat=
e the format of the research dashboard. Live metrics will appear once the r=
eceipts API is public. Verify any claim via the linked receipts bundle.

Add a small chip above each number:

Demo
 (until wired)

Beneath the metrics, add: 
=E2=80=9CData source: Receipts bundle=
 (coming soon)=E2=80=9D
 and link it once available.

Change the /proof section subtext:

From: 
=E2=80=9CExperience the core SYMBI protocol=E2=80=A6 see how =
trust receipts change in real-time.=E2=80=9D

To:

B) /framework & /research =E2=
=80=94 fix the whitepaper links

Until PDFs exist, swap CTA labels =
to avoid over-promising:
