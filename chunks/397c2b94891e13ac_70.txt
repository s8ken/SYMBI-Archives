Case study disclaimer:

This is an observational analysis=

 or affiliation is implied. Replicate our prompts and judge for yourself.

Why these changes matter

They 
remove any implied unverified claims
 while keepin=
g the story strong.

They 
reduce investor/regulator risk
 by aligning visibl=
e numbers with receipts or clearly labeling demos.

They 
bring SYMBI Resonance into the narrative
 as the l=
ab, and 
seed case studies
 without over-claiming.

If you want, I can draft the 
/case-studies

wo slug pages as MDX (with neutral copy, =E2=80=9Ccoming soon=E2=80=9D rece=
ipts slots) and a tiny 
=E2=80=

 component so you can tag any non-live metric=
