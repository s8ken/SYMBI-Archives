There are

Fixes to ship on the site

1) /research =E2=80=94 make claims=
 verifiable (or clearly demo)

Tag any numbers/graphs as 
Demo
 until they are backed b=
y a receipts bundle. Add a source note under the metric block:

=E2=80=9CSource: synthetic datase=
t. Live receipts + methods will be linked here when the Foundation receipts=
 API is public.=E2=80=9D

Replace =E2=80=9Clive metrics=E2=
=80=9D phrasing with:

=E2=80=9CThese figures illustrate=
 the research dashboard. Live metrics will appear once the receipts API is =
public.=E2=80=9D

Add 
Resonate
 as the lab link: =E2=80=9CExplore the det=
ection framework in the 
SYMBI=
-Resonate
 repo.=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 link to the repo README.

2) Whitepapers / downloads =E2=80=
=94 label correctly until PDFs exist

Change any 
=E2=80=9CDownload Whitepaper (PDF)=E2=80=9D
=
 to 
=E2=80=9CRead in Vault (M=
arkdown)=E2=80=9D
 and point to the 
Vault repo
 (or to the exact folder when you=E2=80=
=99re ready). Update back to =E2=80=9CDownload PDF (sha256: =E2=80=A6)=E2=
=80=9D once you publish the built PDFs.

3) Add 
SYMBI Resonate
 to the IA

New top-level or secondary nav ite=

4) Add 
Case Studies
 (safe, non-overclaiming)

Create a

A) Claude =E2=80=94

Sections: Scope & prompts, Art=

Receipts (coming soon)
.

Link out to 
SYMBI-Resonate

# Claude: Emergent Boundaries (Observational)

> Disclaimer: Not affiliated with Anthropic. This is an observational an=
alysis under our prompts/settings only.

## Setup
Prompts, models, temperature, safety settings.

## Articles tested (A1=E2=80=93A7)
Briefly define each Article and what a pass/fail looks like.

## Observations
Bullet observations with short quotes/redactions.

## Limitations
Where this might not generalize; risks of over-interpretation.

## Receipts
*Coming soon:* signed bundle (hash, timestamp) with prompts, outputs, rubri=
c decisions.
