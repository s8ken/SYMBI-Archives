=E2=80=9D link to the SYMBI-Resonate=

GitHub

Small repo upgrades that will hel=
p your story (low effort)

Add a short 
test/RE=
ADME.md

 explaining how to run the suites:

JS: 
npm test
 (or whatever your script is in 
package.json
)

Python: 
pytest
 (if that=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99re usin=
g)

Spell out 
expected outputs/thresh=
olds
 for each test variant (balanced/calibrated/enhanced).

Add a CI badge
 (GitHub Actions) that runs both JS + Py=
thon tests on every push. Then on 
/research
, you can show:

=E2=80=9CLatest commit 
abc123
 =E2=80=94 tests: =E2=9C=
=85 (date/time)=E2=80=9D
 linking to the CI run.

Name the dimensions in comments inside each test
 so re=
viewers see a 1:1 mapping from test to the five framework dimensions in the=
 README. 

GitHub

Copy you can paste (two places)

/research (under hero, small box):

Verification

Repo tests cover baseline, balanced, enhanced, and calibrated detectors in =
both Python and JavaScript. These are 
development checks
, not production metrics. See: 
SYMBI-Resonate/test
 (README explains=
 the five detection dimensions).

/resonance (footer line):

Lab source: 
SYMBI-Resonate
 (detector + tests). Start w=
ith the README, then explore 
/t=
est/
 for parity checks.

That keeps the site honest, gives =
reviewers a concrete place to click, and tees you up to add =E2=80=9Creceip=
ts=E2=80=9D links later without rewriting the narrative.
