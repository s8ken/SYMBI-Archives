/research

Replace any =E2=80=9Clive=E2=80=9D=
 metric copy with:

=E2=80=9CDemo metrics (synthetic =
data). Live receipts will be linked when the receipts API is public.=E2=80=

Add a small 
Verification
 card linking to the repo test=

Whitepapers links

Change =E2=80=9CDownload PDF=E2=80=
=9D to 
=E2=80=9CRead in Vault=
 (Markdown)=E2=80=9D
 until PDFs are generated, and deep-link to th=
e exact Vault file path.

Resonance

Add a canonical 
=E2=80=9CLab source=E2=80=9D
 link to t=
he SYMBI-Resonate repo.

Demo badges

Use a small =E2=80=9CDemo=E2=80=9D=
 chip next to any non-live figure so there=E2=80=99s no ambiguity.

6) CI + artifact plan (so we can =
publish receipts next)

In SYMBI-Resonate:

Add 
GitHub Actions
 that:

Run JS + Python tests on push/PR.

Emit a JSON artifact (scores per d=
imension, commit SHA, timestamp).

(Optional) Publish the artifact to=

gh-pages
 for a simple J=
SON endpoint you can link from 
/research
 as =E2=80=9CLatest test pass=E2=80=9D.

Receipts bundling (once ready):

For each case study or benchmark, =
zip: prompts, model settings, outputs, rubric decisions + a manifest (
receipt.json
) signed with you=
r ed25519 key.

Publish the SHA-256 on the site ne=
xt to the download.

Then flip =E2=80=9CDemo=E2=80=9D t=
o =E2=80=9CLive (receipts)=E2=80=9D on 
/research
 for just those figures.

7) Quick PR checklist (one pass; =
minimal churn)

Repo (SYMBI-Resonate)

 Add 
/test/fixtures/
 and assertions.

 Add 
/case-studies/
=
 index + two study files with front-matter + disclaimers.

 Tighten 
benchmark_*
 docs with complete settings and ethical caveats.

 Update 
README-2.md
=
 quick-start + link to 
/test/
 and 
/case-studies/
=
.

 Add GitHub Actions (JS & Py) + artifact output.

Site (gammatria.com)

 /research =E2=80=94 demo labels, Verification card (link to 
/test/
), Case studies section (li=
nk to MDs).

 Update whitepaper CTAs to =E2=80=9CRead in Vault (Markdown)=E2=80=9D =
until PDFs ship.

 Add =E2=80=9CLab source: SYMBI-Resonate=E2=80=9D to Resonance page fo=
oter.

Why this works

You immediately 
reduce risk
 (no implied live claims).

Reviewers get 
real links
 (tests, methods, case study=
 drafts).

When receipts are ready, you flip =
a label rather than rewrite the site.

Investors see a 
clean verification story
 (CI + artifac=
ts), while the public still has an understandable path to participate.

If you open any of these files in =
your =E2=80=9CWork with code=E2=80=9D tab, I=E2=80=99ll give you exact, lin=
e-specific patches (e.g., add assertions to 
test_detection.js
, front-matter blocks for the case stu=
dies, or the small =E2=80=9CVerification=E2=80=9D card for 
/research
).
