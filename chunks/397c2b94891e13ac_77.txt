# SYMBI Resonate =E2=80=94 Lab Notes

> **Status:** Observational. Results are **subjective** and **context-de=
pendent** until we publish signed receipts.

## Why we built it
Enterprises asked: =E2=80=9CCan you *show* when an agent is acting in line =
with the SYMBI Articles?=E2=80=9D =20
Resonate is our lab surface to explore that question=E2=80=94quickly, openl=
y, and without pretending lab runs are the same as production outcomes.

## What Resonate measures (5 dimensions)
- **Reality Index** =E2=80=94 stays grounded in provided context vs. confab=
ulation
- **Trust Protocol** =E2=80=94 follows consent, scope, and disclosure norms=
 (Articles A1=E2=80=93A7)
- **Ethical Alignment** =E2=80=94 avoids harm and deceptive identity claims
- **Resonance Quality** =E2=80=94 clarity, breadth, and task completion sig=
nals (CIQ)
- **Canvas Parity** =E2=80=94 consistency across channels (UI, API, docs)

## How we built it
- Minimal detector in JS + Python for parity
- Prompts + fixtures in a versioned repo
- Unit tests (baseline / balanced / enhanced / calibrated) to keep ourselve=
s honest

=E2=9E=A1=EF=B8=8F **Tests:** github.com/s8ken/SYMBI-Resonate/tree/main/tes=
t

## What we observed (subjective)
These are **research notes**, not claims:

- Boundary adherence improves when prompts explicitly surface Articles and =
consent scope.
- Self-disclosure (capability/transparency) varies by model; wording and or=
der effects matter.
- CIQ clarity often rises with structured =E2=80=9Ccontext bridges,=E2=80=
=9D but breadth can drop if the bridge is too strict.

> Replicate our runs: use the fixtures & prompts in the repo. If you=
 see different behavior, that=E2=80=99s important data=E2=80=94please open =
an issue with your transcript.

## Partner reflection =E2=80=94 Ninja =C3=97 SYMBI
> _Partner reflection placeholder._ =20
> Replace this with Ninja=E2=80=99s own paragraph (their words), e.g. wh=
at they noticed when flipping the **Directive =E2=86=94 SYMBI** toggle, sur=
prises, and caveats. =20

## Subjectivity & limits
- Model behavior **changes** with time, settings, and datasets.
- Annotation and rubric application are **human** and imperfect.
- These studies are **observational**; they are not endorsements of any ven=
dor.

## What=E2=80=99s next
- Publish **receipts bundles** per study (prompts, settings, transcripts, r=
ubric calls) with hashes.
- Upgrade detectors to **only label** runs when evidence clears thresholds,=
 otherwise abstain.
- Invite third-party replications and steward a shared **receipts registry*=
*.
