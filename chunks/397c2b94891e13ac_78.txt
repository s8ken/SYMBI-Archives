his page are observational. They depend on prompts, se=
ttings, time, and human judgment.
        Treat them as hypotheses to replicate, not facts to quote, until re=
ceipts are published.

  );
}

Use these at the top of 
/resonance
 and near any chart/=
metric on 
/research
 =
that isn=E2=80=99t wired to receipts yet.

3) /research: replace =E2=80=9Cli=
ve=E2=80=9D voice with honest lab status

Edit 
src/app/research/page.mdx
 (or TSX) in two places:

Top of the page:
 insert 
<SubjectivityNote />
 and swap any =E2=80=9Clive =
metrics=E2=80=9D line for:

Demo metrics (synthetic data).
 These figures illustrat=
e the format of the dashboard.

When we publish a signed receipts bundle, you=E2=80=99ll see a <Receipts=
Badge /> next to the figure with a hash and download.

Verification block:
 add a card:

Verification (repo tests).
 Baseline/Balanced/Enhanced/=
Calibrated detectors pass unit tests in JS & Python.

These are development checks, not production metrics.

Repo:
 github.com/s8k=
en/SYMBI-Resonate/tree/main/test

Next to each number or chart:
 add 
<DemoBadge />
 unless you have a receip=
ts link.

When ready, replace with 
<Re=
ceiptsBadge />
 and a link to the zip + SHA256.

4) Case studies (site pages + rep=
o alignment)

Create a simple landing page:

File:

src/=
app/case-studies/page.mdx

mdx

Copy code

export const metadata =3D { title: 'Case Studies =E2=80=94 SYM=
BI Resonate' };

# Case Studies

_Observational analyses and pilot designs. Subjective until receipts are pu=
blished._

- **Claude: Emergent Boundaries** =E2=80=94 observational notes on Articles=
 A1=E2=80=93A7 =20
  Status: Observational; receipts pending. =20
  Repo: SYMBI-Resonate/case-studies/claude-emergent-boundaries.md

- **Ninja =C3=97 SYMBI: Trust Toggle** =E2=80=94 pilot design (Directive =
=E2=86=94 SYMBI) =20
  Status: Design; receipts pending. =20
  Repo: SYMBI-Resonate/case-studies/ninja-sybi-trust-toggle.md

(If you want on-site full pages, I=
 can hand you the MDX bodies we drafted earlier; for now the landing is eno=
ugh and links to GitHub canon.)

5) language to replace anywhere T=
rae/Codex over-promised

Use these exact substitutions:

=E2=80=9CReal-time / live metrics=E2=80=9D
 =E2=86=92 =
=E2=80=9C
Demo metrics (synthe=
tic data)
; receipts coming soon.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CDownload whitepaper (PDF)=E2=80=9D
 =E2=86=92 =
=E2=80=9C
Read in Vault (Markd=
own)
=E2=80=9D (until PDFs are built).

=E2=80=9CProves X% improvement=E2=80=9D
 =E2=86=92 =E2=
=80=9C
Target:
 =E2=89=
=A515% in =E2=89=A52 CIQ metrics; 
Receipts:
 pending.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CValidated=E2=80=9D
 (without artifacts) =E2=86=
=92 =E2=80=9C
Observed
=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C
Noted =
in lab
=E2=80=9D.

6) include Ninja=E2=80=99s reflec=
tion safely

We should 
quote them verbatim
 once you have their word=
s. Until then, keep a placeholder on /resonance (as above). When ready, for=
mat like:

mdx

Copy code

> =E2=80=9CSwitching the toggle made [X] clearer and [Y] sa=
fer, but [Z] sometimes slowed first response.=E2=80=9D
> =E2=80=94 Name Surname, Role, Ninja (date)

and add a line: 
=E2=80=9CAnecdotal reflection; receipts to follow i=
f a pilot proceeds.=E2=80=9D

7) quick commit plan (no churn)

Commit 1 =E2=80=94 content

Add 
src/app/resonance/page.mdx

Add 
src/app/case-studies/page.mdx

Edit 
src/app/research/page.*
 to insert 
<SubjectivityNote />
 + badge text and=
 verification card

Change whitepaper CTAs to =E2=80=
=9CRead in Vault (Markdown)=E2=80=9D

Commit 2 =E2=80=94 components

Add 
src/components/Badges.tsx

Add 
src/components/SubjectivityNote.tsx

Commit 3 =E2=80=94 link hygiene

Add footer/See-also links to 
SYMBI-Resonate
 repo and 
/case-studies

Add =E2=80=9CResonate=E2=80=9D to =
the main nav (if not already)

why this works

Keeps the rebel spirit
 (we=E2=80=99re experimenting in=
 public) but 
doesn=E2=80=99t =
over-claim
.

Makes room for 
Ninja=E2=80=99s own words
.

Gives readers a clear mental model=
