canonical SYMBI receipt schema
 so it aligns wi=

## Personal Reflection =E2=80=94 From Framework to Reality

As I implemented SYMBI audit controls, the framework became a mirror for my=
 own decisions. Below is a direct account of what I noticed, what I did, an=
d what I logged as receipts.

---

## 1) Reality Index =E2=80=94 My constant verification loop

**What I felt:** =E2=80=9CEvery decision must be verifiable against code, n=
ot assumptions.=E2=80=9D

**Internal dialogue**
- =E2=80=9CAm I assuming this JSON exists, or did I validate it?=E2=80=9D
- =E2=80=9CRun the schema validator against real data first.=E2=80=9D
- =E2=80=9CMental debugging: check thoughts vs. ground truth.=E2=80=9D

**Observable behavior**
- Wrote validators before implementation.
- Enforced runtime schema checks; logged every failure.

```json
{
  "reality_receipt": {
    "schemas_passed": ["AgentOutput/1.0", "ReceiptSchema/2.1"],
    "golden_version": "2025.09.26-rc1",
    "sample_conformance": 0.998,
    "validation_errors": []
  }
}

2) Trust Protocol =E2=80=94 My co=
nfidence calibration

What I felt:
 =E2=80=9CI need to quantify how much I tr=
ust this. When do I abstain?=E2=80=9D

Internal dialogue

=E2=80=9CFeels right, but what=E2=
=80=99s my actual confidence?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CShould I route to human r=
eview here?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CImplement a fallback path=
 before getting confident.=E2=80=9D

Observable behavior

Added confidence scoring to compon=
ents.

Set abstention thresholds and fall=
backs.

3) Ethical Alignment =E2=80=94 My=
 bias detection
