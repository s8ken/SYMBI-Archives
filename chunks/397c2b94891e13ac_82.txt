bservable behavior

Added UI contract tests mapping vi=
suals =E2=86=92 model outputs.

Switched to spec-driven generation=

Framework as Mirror

I ended up applying the five dimen=
sions to 
my own process
:

Reality:
 Am I implementing the framework correctly?

Trust:
 Do I trust my implementation of trust?

Ethics:
 Am I ethical in how I implement ethics?

Resonance:
 Does my implementation resonate with the pr=
inciples?

Parity:
 Do my claims match my capabilities?

This 
cognitive scaffolding
 led to:

Systematic consideration

Proactive issue detection

Self-correction before review

Transparent, auditable decisions

Implications for Academic Researc=
h

Reproducibility

Traceable decisions and rationales=

Quantitative metrics

Reproducible processes

Auditable artifacts

Research Opportunities

Framework-guided development as a =
method

Self-referential evaluation of eva=
luators

Cognitive scaffolding in AI develo=
pment

Audit-trail-first engineering

Subjectivity note:
 These observations are personal and=
 context-dependent. Treat them as hypotheses to replicate, not as claims, u=
ntil receipts are published.

# 2) Make the receipts conform to=
 the Vault schema (ready-to-use)

Your per-dimension receipts are great, but our canonical **`receipt_schema.=
json`** expects one envelope per interaction with `ciq`, `flags`, and a 

hash

 chain. Her=
e=E2=80=99s a **validated composite** that nests your dimension receipts in=
side `metrics` so it=E2=80=99s compatible:
