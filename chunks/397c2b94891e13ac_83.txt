If you want each dimension to have=
 its 
own
 signed rece=
ipt, keep them as separate envelopes and link them via 
hash_prev
 (hash-chain). For the website, you=
 can embed the 
composite
 above and link to the per-dimension JSON files in the repo.

3) Quick publishing checklist (so=
 we don=E2=80=99t over-claim)

Label the page 
Observational
 (done in the MDX above).=

Add a small 
badge
 (=E2=80=9CObservational=E2=80=9D / =
=E2=80=9CReceipts pending=E2=80=9D) next to any charts/numbers on the page.=

Link to the 
SYMBI-Resonate
 repo 
test/
 and (when you commit them) a 
case-studies/agent-experience-account/
 folder containing:

the composite receipt JSON,

any per-dimension receipt JSONs,

a short 
METHODS.md
 (prompts, versions, settings).

Commit plan

Add the MDX page above.

Create 
SYMBI-Resonate/case-studies/agent-experience-account/
 with 
RECEIPT.json
 (co=
mposite), plus your five dimension receipts.

Add a short 
METHODS.md
 (model/settings, validator versions=
, test matrices).

4) Tiny copy edits you can apply =
anywhere this appears

Keep =E2=80=9C
I felt=E2=80=A6
 / 
Internal dialogue
 / 
Observable behavior
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94=
 it=E2=80=99s gold.

Always add a one-liner: 
=E2=80=9CObservational; subjective; rep=
licate before you quote.=E2=80=9D

Where a number appears (e.g., 
0.998
, 
0.93
), add 
how it=E2=80=99s computed
 (briefly) or tag as 
dev-run
 until your methods d=
oc is pushed.

If you want, I can also draft the =

METHODS.md
 and stub the =
five per-dimension receipt files so you can drop them straight into 
SYMBI-Resonate
 and link fro=
m the new page.
