Below are paste-ready fixes you can =
drop in now.

1) /research: replace the =E2=80=9C=
LIVE METRICS=E2=80=9D block

Swap the intro + showcase copy for this:

mdx

Copy code

import SubjectivityNote from '@/components/SubjectivityNote';

# Publications & case studies

Peer-review artifacts and preregistered experiments live here. Raw material=
s and datasets are mirrored in the Vault with checksums and licenses.

<SubjectivityNote />

## Research Showcase

> **Demo metrics (synthetic data).** These figures illustrate the resear=
ch dashboard.
> When a study publishes a signed receipts bundle, you=E2=80=99ll see a =
=E2=80=9CReceipts=E2=80=9D tag with a hash and download link.

Replace the numeric tiles with neutral shells (no hard numbers)=
:

x-2 py-0.5 text-xs">Demo</span>

Under the /proof section, add:

mdx

Copy code

> This toggle uses synthetic data in this demo. The product=
ion version exports a signed receipt.

Add a Verification card near the top:

mdx

Copy code

### Verification (repo tests)
Baseline / Balanced / Enhanced / Calibrated detector suites run in both Jav=
aScript and Python to guard against drift.
These are **development checks**, not production metrics.
Repo: https://github.com/s8ken/SYMBI-Resonate/tree/main/test

This aligns with what=E2=80=99s re=
ally in the repo right now. 

Gammatria

Case studies section (links to pages you add or to GitHub for n=
ow):

mdx

Copy code

## Case studies

2) Home page: soften =E2=80=9CSig=
nals from the Foundation=E2=80=9D

Change the heading + items:

mdx

Copy code

## Signals from the Foundation  <span class=3D"rounded bg-n=
eutral-100 px-2 py-0.5 text-xs">Demo</span>
Updated weekly. Demo placeholders until receipts are public.

- Grant =E2=80=94 ARC Discovery Projects 2026 =C2=B7 Submission: Nov 2025
- Publication =E2=80=94 Governance whitepaper v1 =C2=B7 September 2025
- Receipt =E2=80=94 *Receipts bundle: pending*

(Or temporarily remove the =E2=80=
=9C2,184 receipts=E2=80=9D line entirely.)
