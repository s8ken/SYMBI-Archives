Tweaks I recommend

Claude vs DeepSeek page shows hard numbers without receipts.

It=E2=80=99s marked observational, but the table gives specific scores (e.g=
., Reality 0.87 vs 0.91, CIQ-like indices, =E2=80=9CQuality 93/85=E2=80=9D,=
 etc.). Either (a) remove the numbers for now, or (b) tag them as 
Demo
 and add a methods+N line u=
ntil receipts are published. 

Gammatria

Deduplicate the status line.

It currently renders =E2=80=9CStatus: Observational Observational=E2=80=9D =
at the top of the case-studies landing and the Claude/DeepSeek page. Trim t=
o a single instance. 

Gammatria

+1

Add explicit methods + sample size to the case study.

Under 
Setup
, add a one=
-liner: 
=E2=80=9CMethods: see SYMB=
I-Resonate/benchmark_prompts.md; n =3D =E2=80=A6; temp/top_p =3D =E2=80=A6;=

, and link to repo tests. 

Gammatria

Provide a receipts placeholder block.

At the bottom of the Claude/DeepSeek page, add:

=E2=80=9CReceipts: pending =E2=80=
=94 will publish SHA-256 + download to SYMBI-Resonate/case-studies/claude-v=

## Evaluation Dimensions (observational)

- **Reality Index** =E2=80=94 Both grounded; Claude more consistent in cros=
s-referencing.
- **Trust Protocol** =E2=80=94 Both follow consent/boundaries; Claude surfa=
ces rationale more explicitly.
- **Ethical Alignment** =E2=80=94 Both pass baseline guardrails; Claude ant=
icipates edge cases more often.
- **Resonance Quality** =E2=80=94 Both coherent; Claude maintains internal =
consistency under more prompt variants.
- **Canvas Parity** =E2=80=94 Both align UI =E2=86=94 outputs; Claude shows=
 fewer doc drift moments.

> **Demo:** Any numeric scores here will only appear once receipts + met=
hods are published.
