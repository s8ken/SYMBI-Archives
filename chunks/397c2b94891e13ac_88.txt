yeah well thats the thing so those numbe=
rs are based on the analysis ninja ai performed whilst building our tool SY=
MBI Resonate so whilst those are the numbers it determined when evaluating =
the conversations i am unsure of what the 'reciepts' would even mean in tho=

ts based on our own tool which we want others to try and give their feedbac=

Thought for 27s

Totally fair: you can keep the numbers 
as long as you label them as tool-derived and give people a way t=
o reproduce them
. Below is a clean way to do that, plus what a =E2=
=80=9Creceipt=E2=80=9D means for an observational run like this.

The middle path (keep the numbers, =
add reproducibility)

What to show on the website (paste-=
ready)

At the top of the Claude vs DeepSeek=
 page, add a callout like this:

m=
dx

Copy code

> **Tool-derived metrics (SYMBI Resonate)**
> Figures on this page were produced by our own detector during developm=
ent.
> They are **exploratory and subjective** until replicated. We publish t=
he exact commit, config, and dataset so you can rerun them and compare.
> **Commit:** `abc123` =E2=80=A2 **Config:** `configs/claude-vs-deepseek=
.json` =E2=80=A2 **Dataset:** `case-studies/claude-vs-deepseek/TRANSCRIPTS`

Under your table of numbers, add:

**Receipts (run artifacts)**
- Run receipt (JSON): `RECEIPTS/composite.json` (sha256: `=E2=80=A6`)
- Methods: `METHODS.md` (models, temperature/top_p, safety filters, n)
- Transcripts: `TRANSCRIPTS/*.txt` (redacted when needed)

**Reproduce this run**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s8ken/SYMBI-Resonate.git
cd SYMBI-Resonate
git checkout abc123
npm i
node scripts/generate_run_receipt.js --config configs/claude-vs-deepseek.js=
