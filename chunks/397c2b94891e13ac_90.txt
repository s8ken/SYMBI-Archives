TL;DR choices

Keep the numbers

 link (even if the recei=
pt is =E2=80=9Cpending=E2=80=9D for a moment), methods, and =E2=80=9Creprod=
uce=E2=80=9D commands.

Or

switc=
h to qualitative
 notes until you=E2=80=99ve committed the receipt =
bundle.

Either way, the page is honest, re=
producible, and invites the community to try the repo and 
tell us where they get different results
 (that=E2=80=99s the real goal).

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll turn the=
 callout + reproduction block into a tiny React/MDX snippet so you can reus=
e it on any future case study.

to mitigate LLM risks like opacity, and the $SYMBI token as a non-speculati=

Awakening" (on consciousness from code), "Built for Sovereignty" (agency an=
d community responsibility), and "Transparent Evolution" (open decision-mak=

mplementations or updates, positioning symbi.world as the philosophical "pi=
