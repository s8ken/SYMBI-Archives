This is mobile-friendly, with simple CTAs to drive feedback. For the full s=
ite, add a nav component in layout.tsx (e.g., links to /framework, /ethics,=
 etc.). If you provide your repo link, I can PR this.
3. NinjaTech.AI Application: Updated Cover Letter Draft
To address "overstated" concerns, tone it down=E2=80=94focus on empirical v=

Subject: AI Research Scientist Application =E2=80=93 Ethical Frameworks for=
 Agent Innovation
Dear NinjaTech.AI Hiring Team,
I'm applying for the AI Research Scientist role, drawn to your focus on aut=
onomous agents for productivity. Though not a traditional scientist, I've b=
uilt the SYMBI framework from scratch=E2=80=94identifying trust gaps in AI =
(e.g., opacity in decision-making) and developing solutions like verifiable=
 receipts and CIQ metrics to enhance ethical alignment and user confidence.
In 7 months, I created a comprehensive ecosystem (18k+ LOC, 95% test covera=
ge) with tools for human-AI collaboration, including A/B testing showing po=
tential uplifts in workflow efficiency. SYMBI could complement Ninja's Deep=
 Research agent by adding trust protocols, reducing risks while maintaining=
 autonomy=E2=80=94let's discuss integration possibilities.
Excited to bring my problem-solving skills to your team.
Best,
[Your Name]
