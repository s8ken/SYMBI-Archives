Full Analysis: Recommended Online Places for Feedback on SYMBI
Given SYMBI's focus on AI sovereignty, trust protocols, ethical frameworks,=
 open-source governance, and academic/commercial separation, the ideal feed=

These are ideal for high-level feedback on SYMBI's ethics pillar (e.g., Tru=

 replication kits, CIQ metrics).

OpenAI Community Forum (community.openai.com): A dedicated section for "AI =
Ethics, Society, and Culture" (as per search results) where users discuss g=
