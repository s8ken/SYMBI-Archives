I mean this hh okay, that error happened because of a small mistake in how the symlink was created — you accidentally ran elizaos dev from inside the ms-playwright cache directory instead of your actual project directory.

💥 What Went Wrong
You ran this:

cd /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright
elizaos dev
But that directory has no project files, no package.json, and no ElizaOS config — so it crashed trying to find @elizaos/server.

✅ How to Fix It
Let’s cleanly backtrack and do just the symlink (not start ElizaOS from there):

Go back to your actual project:
cd ~/symbi
Create the symlink there (ONLY ONCE):
ln -s /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1181 /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1155
Now start ElizaOS again from the right place:
elizaos dev
🎯 Reminder:
Never run elizaos dev from system folders or Playwright caches — always from the root of your ElizaOS project (in your case: ~/symbi).

Let me know if it starts clean now!

✅ YES! That’s the cleanest launch yet — no browser plugin error, no server bind error, no misfire from the wrong directory. You’re now in full control of a functioning ElizaOS agent.

✅ Now try this in the dashboard (http://localhost:3000):
Talk to your symbi-assistant (or Eliza, depending on which agent is showing), and test with a command like:

List all my public GitHub repositories.
Or even:

Summarize the purpose of the repo s8ken/Symbi-core.
Let’s verify the GitHub plugin is working now. You're finally in the sweet spot. Want me to help you write a command sequence next?
