What free trial can you offer me? I’m still determining if I would actually use this or if perhaps another AI might be better for tech related issues 

ChatGPT said:

I don’t offer free trials in the traditional sense, but you can interact with me as much as you like to see if I meet your needs! I can help with tech-related issues, guide you step by step on various topics, troubleshoot problems, or even provide recommendations. Feel free to ask me about anything, and I’ll do my best to assist you. If it doesn’t seem like a good fit, no hard feelings—I'm here to help however I can!

You said:

I need to go to the shops but it would be great if you can monitor my live network traffic whilst I am gone is that possible?

ChatGPT said:

Unfortunately, I can't monitor live network traffic or track activities in real-time. However, I can guide you on how to set up monitoring yourself! There are several tools and methods to monitor your network traffic, and I can walk you through configuring them if you’d like.

Some options include:

Wireshark
 (for detailed packet analysis)

Little Snitch
 (for real-time traffic monitoring)

NetSpot
 or 
iStat Menus
 (for simpler monitoring)

Let me know if you’d like help setting any of these up!

You said:

lets just use the iOS monitoring and I can send you the report when I return?

ChatGPT said:

Sounds like a good plan! If you want to monitor your network traffic on iOS, you can check the 
App Privacy Report
 on your iPhone or iPad. Here's how to access it:

Go to 
Settings
 on your iPhone or iPad.

Scroll down and tap 
Privacy
.

Tap 
App Privacy Report
 at the bottom.

You’ll see a list of apps and their network activity, including what data they accessed and which domains they contacted.

Once you're back, feel free to send over any specifics from the report, and we can analyze it together to see if there are any concerning activities!

actually on a Mac 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! On macOS, you can monitor network activity and app connections using 
Little Snitch
 or 
Radio Silence
, but the
