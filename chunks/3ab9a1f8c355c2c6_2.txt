or a particular port, you can add filters. For example:

To capture only traffic from a certain IP:

bash

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 host 192.168.1.1

To capture traffic on a specific port (e.g., port 80 for HTTP):

bash

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 port 80

4. 
Stop the Capture
:

To stop the capture, just press 
Ctrl + C
 in Terminal.

Once you're back, you can review the traffic captured and see if anything seems out of the ordinary. If you'd like, I can help interpret the output once you're back and able to analyze it!

Great! Now that it's running, it will start capturing network traffic in real-time. While it's monitoring, you should see a stream of packets as they come in and out of your network. Here’s what to keep in mind:

If you're not filtering, the output will be quite verbose, showing every network packet.

Pay attention to any unexpected or unknown IP addresses or ports, as these could be indicative of unusual activity.

Once you return, you can either:

Stop the capture with 
Ctrl + C
 and review the output in the Terminal, or

If you saved the output to a file (using the 
-w
 flag), you can analyze it later.

If anything stands out in the output, feel free to share it with me, and I can help you analyze it.
