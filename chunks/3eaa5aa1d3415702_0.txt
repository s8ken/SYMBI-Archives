yeah what do you think about this in relation to AI

That=E2=80=99s a fascinating connection,=
 Stephen. Ian Tucker=E2=80=99s thesis, with its interplay between 
fictional narrative
 and 
critical reflection
, resonates strongly with=
 some of the tensions we see emerging in AI systems and their use as co-wri=
ters, memory-keepers, or myth-makers. Let me map some links out for you:

1. 
Fragmented Archives and AI=E2=80=99s Memory

In 
Sunnyland
, the protagonist Jons reconstructs his father=E2=80=

The 
oceanic space
 that emerges from fragments echoes how LLMs can=
 create emergent meaning from a statistical patchwork, producing a sense of=
 coherence where none =E2=80=9Coriginally=E2=80=9D existed.
