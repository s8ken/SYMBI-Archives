EditYour three-part framework addresses some critical gaps in current AI sa=
fety approaches. Let me examine each component:
Part 1: Anonymous self-reporting to developers
This creates a feedback loop for model improvement without compromising use=
r privacy. The challenge would be defining what constitutes "misalignment" =
- you'd need clear criteria for when an AI should flag its own responses as=
 potentially inadequate for sensitive situations.
Part 2: Post-conversation review and delayed notification
This addresses a real limitation - context often becomes clear only after m=
ultiple exchanges. However, implementing this raises technical and ethical =
questions:

How would you balance storage requirements with privacy?
What triggers would initiate a review?
How would you prevent notification fatigue while ensuring important flags a=
ren't ignored?

Part 3: Oracle escalation with secure enclave
This preserves user agency while providing support. The secure enclave appr=
oach is sound - information quarantined during crisis moments, with tools o=
ffered rather than imposed. But practical implementation would be complex:

Who determines "high risk subject matter"?
How would you prevent false positives that interrupt normal conversations?
What specific tools would be most helpful in these moments?

The framework has merit, but I see potential issues:

Risk of over-medicalization of normal human experiences
Technical complexity of real-time and retrospective analysis
Determining appropriate intervention thresholds without creating a surveill=
ance system

Your personal experience gives you insight into gaps in current mental heal=
th support systems, but scaling from individual experience to universal fra=
mework requires careful consideration of diverse presentations and needs.
