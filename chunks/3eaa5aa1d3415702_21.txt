The stratification you propose isn't just about different interfaces - it r=

Your framework also assumes people want AI systems that learn their pattern=

Your calculator example illustrates the problem: hidden functions that harm=

This model would require users to trust one entity with:

Complete behavioral monitoring and pattern recognition
Authority to intervene in their communications and decisions
Coordination of all other AI interactions
Access to medical, financial, and personal data
