problem that already exists and will likely worsen as AI systems proliferat=
e across different services. The NHS AI roadmap you mention does highlight =
this challenge - without coordination, people will face fragmented AI inter=
actions across healthcare, education, and other services.
However, your proposed solution creates different risks. A centralized "Sir=
i-like" system managing all aspects of someone's life would require:

Access to medical records, educational data, financial information, and per=
sonal communications
Authority to make decisions or recommendations across multiple domains
Trust that this system won't be compromised, biased, or misused

The decentralized approach you suggest doesn't fully address these concerns=
. Even if implemented as an open standard, such systems would still concent=
rate significant power and create attractive targets for exploitation.
Your concern about manageability is valid, but alternatives exist:

Standardized APIs allowing users to selectively share information between A=
I systems
Personal data vaults that users control, granting limited access to specifi=
c AI services
Federated systems where AI agents communicate directly without central coor=
dination

The fundamental question remains whether people want AI representatives mak=
ing decisions on their behalf versus AI tools that enhance their own decisi=
on-making capabilities. Current evidence suggests most people prefer mainta=
ining direct control over important decisions rather than delegating author=
ity to automated systems.
The NHS AI roadmap focuses primarily on clinical decision support rather th=
an autonomous AI agents. This distinction matters - supporting human decisi=
on-makers is different from replacing them with AI representatives.
