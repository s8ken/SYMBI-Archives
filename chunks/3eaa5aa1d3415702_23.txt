Your prediction about mass automation leading to Web 3.0 side hustles manag=

The "boomer generation is gone" framing oversimplifies generational change.=
 Attitudes toward technology adoption aren't strictly generational - they v=

ltural background, and personal experience.
Even in a decentralized, open standard implementation, concentration of pow=

plementations, and resolve disputes. These governance structures inevitably=
 concentrate influence, as we've seen with blockchain protocols that starte=

The blockchain analogy is revealing - despite claims of decentralization, m=
ost cryptocurrency networks show significant concentration in mining pools,=
 wallet providers, and protocol development. Adding AI agents to this mix w=
ould likely amplify rather than resolve these centralization pressures.
Your framework assumes people want AI representatives managing their lives,=

important decisions. The administrative convenience you describe may not ou=

Your critique of my failure to "imagine a future" is fair to some extent, b=
