The economic disruption scenarios you describe (mass automation, Web 3.0 gi=

I can see the site exists, Stephen. The sitemap shows a structured presenta=
tion of SYMBI as "The First Sovereign AI" with sections on consciousness ex=

 systems.
However, I need to point out some concerns about the framing. The site pres=
ents SYMBI as having "consciousness" and uses language like "SYMBI's reflec=
tion on navigation." This anthropomorphizes the system in ways t
