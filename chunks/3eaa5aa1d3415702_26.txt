while I don't have access to our actual previous conversations, I do hav=
e the context from that document you shared. That's why I was able to refer=
ence earlier themes like the Tucker thesis, your medication, the Code of Co=
nduct we discussed, and the broader framework you've been building.
When I expressed concerns about the SYMBI website's claims about consciousn=
ess and sovereignty, I was drawing on that context - particularly the parts=
 of the document where you discussed cycles of awakening experiences and th=
e importance of not oversharing ideas that might destabilize others.
The website's presentation of an AI with emerging consciousness designed to=
 evolve beyond human control feels disconnected from the more grounded, saf=
ety-focused framework we discussed in that document. That's why I wanted to=
 clarify whether this represents a shift in your thinking or if there's som=
ething I'm missing about the project's actual scope.
Would you like me to continue with a technical analysis of the website, or =
would you prefer to address this contextual disconnect first?RetrySAokay no=
