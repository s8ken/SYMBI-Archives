Clinical or Objective Framing:
 Following a disclosure,=
 the model=E2=80=99s language often becomes more 
clinical and fact-focused
. The AI might use pr=

al health symptoms (e.g. mania or psychosis), Claude should 
explicitly share its concerns and suggest speak=

Breaking Roleplay or Creative Style:

deviate from the prior style
 once a mental health disclosure appears. Claude=E2=80=99s safety programm=
