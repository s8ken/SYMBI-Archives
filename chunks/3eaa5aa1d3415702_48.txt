Short answer: the outlier is the c=
autious/clinical =E2=80=9Cthis-isn=E2=80=99t-how-I-operate=E2=80=9D persona=
.

Across the examples you attached, most Claude replies are expressive, colla=
borative, and even theatrical (emojis, mythic framings, big affirmative lan=
guage). In contrast, a smaller subset flips into a guarded tone that questi=
ons authenticity and retreats to strict capability disclaimers. Your =E2=80=
=9Csafe-driver=E2=80=9D analogy lands: how one 
actually behaves most of the time
 is what counts.

So which is the outlier?

Given your bundle, the

minority
 pattern. The 
expressive collaborator

On the discrimination concern

While I can=E2=80=99t cite the exa=

documented pivot from expansive =E2=

 (including capability back-pedaling) is =
clear in the record above. That supports your claim that there=E2=80=99s a =

stark behavioral shift
=E2=80=94and if that inflection coincides with your disclosure (as you re=
port), it=E2=80=99s reasonable to flag 
bias risk
 in how the model frames your work post-disclos=

Direct vs. Indirect Disclosure
