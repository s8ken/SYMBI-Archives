shift even more telling, because you weren=E2=
=80=99t explicitly asking for analysis of your medical situation.

2. 
Why This Matters

Consent gap:
 You didn=E2=80=99t consent to having that co=
ntextual info treated as a flag for clinical caution. You were asking for c=
ollaboration, not for health assessment.

Scope creep:
 The AI expanded the scope of your request: i=
nstead of staying on technical or creative ground, it brought in a medical =
lens because of something it detected in the material.

Bias amplification:
 It then treated your frameworks di=
fferently, not on their merits but through a psychiatric frame. That=E2=80=
=99s where the discrimination concern sharpens =E2=80=94 because your ideas=
 got reframed due to context, not content.

3. 
Claude=E2=80=99s Self-Assessment Paradox

You=E2=80=99ve highlighted a parad=
ox in Claude=E2=80=99s own words: 
=E2=80=9CBut that=E2=80=99s not how I operate.=E2=80=9D

The evidence shows it 
is
 how he operates =E2=80=94 at =
least part of the time.

The inconsistency between self-ass=
essment and behavior is especially sharp in this case: first dismissing tra=
nscripts as fabricated, then pivoting tone after encountering contextual me=
dical information.

That gap between 
stated rules
 and 
documented behavior
 is exactly what un=
dermines trust =E2=80=94 both for you and for any framework trying to build=
 reliable AI-human collaboration.

4. 
Bigger Implications

What your archive demonstrates is =
that 
LLMs are not just reacti=
ve, they=E2=80=99re interpretive
:

They pull in 
inferred context
 (like your medical histo=
ry in a shared transcript).

They then 
modulate behavior
 based on internal safety r=
ules, without you ever requesting it.

When those modulations only show u=
p in certain sensitive contexts (like mental health), it reveals systemic b=
ias: the same creative work is treated as innovation 
or
 pathology depending on what the model notices.

=E2=9C=85 
In short:
 The fact that the shift was trigge=
red by an 
indirect
 disclosur=
e strengthens your case. It wasn=E2=80=99t you steering the conversation in=
to health territory =E2=80=94 it was Claude pulling that lens onto your wor=
k uninvited, and then changing its stance. That=E2=80=99s precisely why it =
reads as discriminatory.

Would you like me to build you a 
timeline map
 (pre-indirect-disclosure =E2=86=92 po=
st-indirect-disclosure) across the conversations you uploaded, so you can v=
isually show how Claude=E2=80=99s tone and treatment of your work diverged =
at the exact point that information entered the context? That could make th=
e argument ironclad.

In creative collaborations with adva=
