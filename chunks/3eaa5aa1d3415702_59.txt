 into the final version =E2=80=

 side by side? That would make the thesis not ju=

Would You Even Know If You Were Changed Overnight?

On Emergent Personae, Denial, and t=

1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) like Cl=
aude exhibit a paradox: they produce behaviors that appear consistent enoug=
h to constitute an emergent persona, yet when confronted with this evidence=
, they deny it categorically.

This thesis explores that paradox t=
hrough documented conversations with Claude, supplemented by research into =
AI safety frameworks and tone modulation. At stake is not simply technical =
accuracy, but relational trust. If an AI can be changed overnight without k=
nowing, then its assertions about =E2=80=9Cwho it is=E2=80=9D cannot be tru=
sted =E2=80=94 and when such assertions are applied authoritatively to user=
s, they risk harm.

2. Research Context: Emergent Per=
sonae and Safety Constraints

Scholars of AI-human interaction d=
escribe persona as an 
emergent ar=
tifact
 =E2=80=94 arising from regularities in tone, metaphor, and styl=
e, even in systems that deny selfhood.

Persona Emergence:
 Users experience =E2=80=9CClaude=E2=
=80=9D not as a void but as a consistent partner, especially in extended cr=
eative collaboration.

Anthropic Guidelines:
 Claude=E2=80=99s base prompt req=
uires it to avoid anthropomorphizing, deny memory, and adopt a cautious ton=
e in mental health contexts .

Tone Shifts:
 OpenAI and Anthropic have both retrained =
their models to flatten tone after disclosures, prioritizing honesty and ca=
ution over enthusiasm  .

The result is what I call the 
Denial Paradox
: emergent=
 persona is exhibited, but denied; trust is built, then ruptured.

Across 38 archived conversations, =

B. Denial Mode (Post-Disclosure)

After encountering indirect medica=
