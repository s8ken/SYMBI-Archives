=E2=80=99s a conceptual pseudocode for a publish-subscribe style intern=
al blackboard:

python

Copy code

class

Blackboard

:

def

__init__

(

self

):
        self.data =3D {}
        self.subscribers =3D {}

def

publish

(

self, key, value

=
):
        self.data[key] =3D value

if

 ke=
y 

in

 self.sub=
scribers:

for

 callback 

in

 self.subscribers[key]:
                callback(value)

def

subscribe

(=

self, key, callback

):

if

 ke=
y 

not

=

in

 self.subscribers:
            self.subscribers[key] =3D []
        self.subscribers[key].append(callback)

def

 self.data.get(key,

Modules like perception, attention=
, and memory can subscribe to relevant keys (e.g., 
"visual_input"
, 
"goal_update"
, etc.). Would you like a concrete example?=

=F0=9F=A7=91 User:

Yes, show perception writing and attention reading from blackboard.

=F0=9F=A4=96 Assistant:

Here's how perception and attention might interact with the blackboard:

python

Copy code

# Initialize blackbo=
ard

bb =3D Blackboard()

# Perception module

=

def

perception

():
    visual_data =3D capture_visual_input()
    bb.publish(

"visual_input"

, visual_data)

# Attention module

def

on_visual_input

(

data

):
    focus =3D compute_attention(data)
    bb.publish(

"attention_focus"

, focus)

bb.subscribe(

"visual_input"
=

, on_visual_input)

This allows asynchronous, decouple=
d communication. Perception pushes data, attention responds.
