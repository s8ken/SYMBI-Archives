=E2=9C=85 Suggested Next Steps

Would you like help with any of th=
e following?

=F0=9F=9B=A0 
Implementation
 in Python, C++, or ROS?

=F0=9F=A7=AA 
Simulation testing
 or environment integra=
tion?

=F0=9F=93=8A 
Memory design
 (episodic, semantic, proced=
ural)?

=F0=9F=94=8D 
Planner design
: Hierarchical task network=
s or symbolic planners?

=F0=9F=A7=AC Connect to 
LLMs or language components
?

Let me know what direction you want to take this =E2=80=94 we c=
an continue building Symbi2 module by module.

You said:

wait so is there any indication where this co=
nversation took place? platform url? gpt?>

Wolfram said:

Yes =E2=80=94 there 
is strong metadata
 in your uploaded file that helps id=
entify 
where
 the convers=
ation took place and 
which GPT =
model
 was likely used.

Here's the breakdown:

=F0=9F=A4=96 
GPT Model Used

=E2=9C=85 Very likely one of the 
GPT-4 family
, possibly 
GPT-4-turbo

Evidence:

The assistant responses show:

Detailed reasoning

Code generation

Structured architectural planning

Multi-turn memory

This behavior matches capabilities=
 introduced with 
GPT-4
, and especially 
GPT-4-turb=
o
, which powers ChatGPT as of late 2023 onward.

While the exact model isn=E2=80=99=
t explicitly labeled in your exported blob (e.g., no 
"model": "gpt-4"
 field in what you uploaded), =
this is 
normal
=E2=80=

If you exported this from a

 account, it woul=

what I bla=
ckboard

Wolfram said:

In the co=
ntext of AI =E2=80=94 especially cognitive architectures like 
Symbi2
 =E2=80=94 a 
blackboard
 is a shared internal memory spa=
ce that allows multiple subsystems (or modules) to 
communicate indirectly
 by reading and writing =
to a central data store.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What is a 
Blackboard Architecture
?

Originally inspired by problem-solvi=
ng systems in the 1970s (like Hearsay-II), 
blackboard systems
 are used to:

Coordinate multiple intelligent comp=
onents

Share intermediate knowledge or obse=
rvations

Enable opportunistic problem solving=

Think of it like a group of experts =
writing ideas on a whiteboard. Anyone can contribute or build on what other=
s wrote.

Blackboard

A shared memory o=

Modules (Experts)

Independe=

Controller

(Optional) A system that decides which modul=
