Memory module
 subscribes to

 and stores it

Planning module
 reads from memory and writes an

Actuator module
 reads and executes the plan

 in Cognitive Architectures?

=E2=9C=85 
Loose coupling
 =E2=80=94 modules don=E2=80=

=E2=9C=85 
Asynchronous communication

Reusability

Would you like:

A

 of how a blackboard works in Symbi2?

Help 
implementing
 it in a specific language?

Or a comparison to other architect=

Let me know how deep you want to go.

=99=82=EF=B8=8F Why is this file on your computer?

Here are a few plausible reasons:

1. 
It came from a browser export or ChatGPT session

If you (or someone using your browse=
r) ever visited 
cha=
t.openai.com

, i=
t=E2=80=99s possible that:

A 
conversation was exported or saved
 automatically or manu=
ally

A browser extension (e.g., for savin=
g chats or notes) downloaded the HTML or blob

A 
cached file was saved
 from a shared link or embedded too=
l

2. 
You downloaded it unknowingly

The file could have been:

Attached in a 
project, zip file, or email

Synced
 from a shared cloud folder (e.g., Google Drive, Dr=
opbox, OneDrive)

Left over from 
someone else's session
 on your machine

3. 
It was generated programmatically

If you=E2=80=99re using a 
codebase or tool
 that interacts=
 with GPT APIs or agents, this could be:

An 
auto-saved transcript
 from a dev tool

A 
test file
 from another Symbi2-related experiment

=F0=9F=94=8D What you can do to i=
nvestigate

=E2=9C=85 Check the file=E2=80=99=
s metadata:

Right-click the file =E2=86=92 Pro=
perties (or 
ls -l
 / 
stat
 in terminal) and look f=
or:

Creation/modification dates

Owner

Path where it was stored/downloade=
d

This might indicate 
when or how it got there
.

=E2=9C=85 Search your machine:

Try searching your filesystem for =

Symbi2
, 
.html
, or 
.txt
 files.

You may find:

Other related files or exports

Clues from other folders or worksp=
aces

=E2=9C=85 Consider this: coincide=
nce or convergence?

The 
fact that it=E2=80=99s about Symbi2
 =E2=80=94 and =
you=E2=80=99re working on Symbi2 =E2=80=94 might feel uncanny. A few possib=
ilities:

Possibility=

Explana=
tion

=F0=9F=92=AC 
It 
is
 your chat

Maybe=
 from an older or shared account/session?

=F0=9F=94=84 
Someone =

Part of a package

related repo

=F0=9F=A7=A0 
Symbi2 is a shared term

You and someon=
e else might have independently used the same name

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Bottom line

This 
is a legitimate ChatGPT export
, but ther
