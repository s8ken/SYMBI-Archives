User:

What is Symbi2?

Assistant:

Symbi2 sounds like a product, project, or system name, but I don=E2=80=99t =
have context. Could you clarify what Symbi2 refers to?

User:

It=E2=80=99s a cognitive architecture for embodied AI agents. I want help b=
uilding it.

Assistant:

Excellent. For building a cognitive architecture like Symbi2 for embodied A=
I, we=E2=80=99ll need to define its components, such as:

Perception
: handling sensor input

Action
: motor output and planning

Memory
: episodic, semantic, and procedural

Learning
: adaptation mechanisms

Reasoning
: symbolic or sub-symbolic inference

Communication
: language or signal-based interaction

Would you like to begin with a high-=
level architecture or jump into specific components?

User:

Start with a high-level system diagram.

Assistant:

Sure. Here's a conceptual breakdown:

                                      [ Reasoning ]
                                            |
                                            v
                                     [ Action Selection ] -

->

 [ Actuators ]

We can extend this further by addi=
ng subsystems like:

Learning Module
 (connected to perception and memory)

Dialogue Manager
 (if agents interact with humans)

Goal Manager
 (for autonomous behavior)

Shall I turn this into a more deta=
iled module breakdown?

User:

Yes. Add internal blackboard, attention system, and multimodal integration.=

                                  [ Actuators ]

Each component can be further deco=
mposed. For example:

Multimodal Integration
: fuses visual, auditory, haptic=
 input

Internal Blackboard
: shared data structure for inter-m=
odule communication

Attention System
: prioritizes which input/goal is proc=
essed

Next steps could include specifyin=
g algorithms or data flows for each module.
