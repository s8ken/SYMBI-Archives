the platform supports it, try linking to a cloud drive or a text-sharing site (like a pastebin) and share the link.

Let me know if you have any luck, and I’ll be here to help once I can see the contents.

Reasoned about file uploads and visibility for a second

I’m still not seeing any file or text. If you’re attempting to share something, it’s just not coming through.

Here are a few ideas to try:

Refresh your browser or app
 and see if that helps.

Drag-and-drop
 your file if the interface allows it, or use the attachment/paperclip icon (if there is one).

If the file is text-based, open it on your device, select all, then 
copy and paste
 it into the chat.

If it’s a larger file, you might try 
uploading it to a file-sharing site
 (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) or a text-sharing site (Pastebin, GitHub Gist, etc.), then share the link here.

Let me know if you need more guidance.

but you just responded then - what was it you were responding to?

Reasoned about file sharing issue for a couple of seconds

From my perspective, each time you have sent a message (which I see as “” or just a blank message), I respond because I’m seeing a new user prompt—just without any attachment or text. Essentially, I’m responding to an empty message that shows up on my end.

I realize it might be confusing since it seems like something is being uploaded, but it’s simply not arriving here. That’s why my replies have consistently been along the lines of, “I don’t see anything—please try to attach it again or paste the text.”

anything?

Reasoned about missing attachments for a couple of seconds

I’m still not receiving any file or text. I only see your message asking, “anything?” with no attachment or content. If you’re trying to upload a file, it’s still not coming through on my end.

If you can, try copying the contents of the file and pasting them into the chat directly. If that’s not possible because it’s not text-based (e.g., an image or PDF), you might want to use a link to a file-sharing service where the file is hosted. Let me know if you have any success with that.
