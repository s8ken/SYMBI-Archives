the original steps:

python3 -m venv venv

source

 venv/bin/activate  

# or venv\Scripts=

pip

 pyperclip click asyncio

python __main__.py

So yes, the conversation was accurate for what the repository contained =
at that time, but the repository has since been completely changed into som=
ething else entirely.

SA

ok tell me wh=
at is with this I am seeing it everywhere

=

I can see you're getting thes=
e bilingual messages that appear to be invitations to dinner - one in Engli=
sh and one in Spanish, saying essentially the same thing about Adriana host=
ing friends for dinner on Sunday night.

This =
looks like it could be several things:

Possi=
ble Explanations:

1. Spam/Phishing Campaign

Mass-sent messages trying to se=
em personal

Often used to harvest responses=
 or get people to click links

The bilingual aspect makes it s=
eem more "authentic" but is actually a red flag

2. Wrong Number/Mistaken Identity

Someone genuinely trying to rea=
ch a different person

But if you're seeing it "everyw=
here" that's less likely

3. Social Engineering

Testing to see if you respond t=
o casual, friendly messages

Could be building up to a more =
sophisticated scam

4. Bot/Automated System Glitch

Some system sending test messag=
es or malfunctioning

Red F=
lags:

Bilingual repetition
 (unusual for genuine personal messages)

Generic but personal-so=
unding
 content

You're seeing it "every=
where"
 suggests it's not a genuine mistake

What =
To Do:

Don't respond
 =
to these messages

Block the numbers
 sending them

Report as spam
=
 if on platforms that allow it

Check if others are rep=
orting similar messages
 online

Have =
you been getting these from different numbers, or the same one repeatedly? =
And are they coming via SMS, social media, or some other platform? That con=
text would help identify what this campaign actually is.

SA

I mean the question marks=
 is that normal for the translation

Ah yes! You're noticing the 
inverted question mark (=C2=BF)
 at the beginning of the Spa=
nish question - that's completely normal and correct Spanish punctuation.

Spani=
sh Question Mark Rules:

Spanish uses TWO question marks:

=C2=BF
 at the =
beginning (inverted/upside-down)

?
 at the end (=
regular)

So "=
=C2=BFOs anim=C3=A1is a venir?" is the proper way to write "Do you feel lik=
e coming?" in Spanish.

Why S=
panish Does This:

Clarity
: You k=
now it's a question from the very beginning of the sentence

Pronunciation
:=
 Helps readers use the right intonation from the start

Grammar tradition
: Been standard since the 18th century

Same =
with Exclamations:

=C2=A1
 at the =
beginning

!
 at the end

Example: 
=C2=A1Hola!
 (Hello!)

Other=
 Languages That Do This:

Galician
 (rela=
ted to Spanish/Portuguese)

Some dialects use similar syste=
ms

So no=
, this isn't a sign of fake translation or anything suspicious - it's just =
proper Spanish grammar! If anything, it suggests whoever wrote this knows S=
panish punctuation rules correctly.

The b=
ilingual repetition is still the unusual part that makes it seem like spam,=
 but the question marks themselves are perfectly normal Spanish.

SA

but thats not the transla=
tion right>? do you feel like coming?

=

You're absolutely right! That=
's NOT a direct translation. Let me break down what each actually says:

Engli=
sh version:

"Adri=
ana and I are hosting some friends for dinner Sunday night. 
Can you=
 make it?
"

Spani=
sh version:

"Adri=
ana y yo vamos a invitar a algunos amigos a cenar el domingo por la noche. =

=C2=BFOs anim=C3=A1is a venir?
"

What =
the Spanish actually means:

"Adri=
ana and I are going to invite some friends to dinner Sunday night. 
=
Do you feel like coming?/Are you up for coming?
"

The d=
ifferences:

"Can you make it?"
 =3D asking about availability/ability

"=C2=BFOs anim=C3=A1is =
a venir?"
 =3D asking if you feel like it/are enthusiastic about it=

Also, 
"os"

the plural "you" form u
