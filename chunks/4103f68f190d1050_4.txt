Why t=
his matters:

This =
discrepancy actually makes it MORE suspicious as spam because:

A genuine bilingual person woul=
d likely make them match better

Automated translation tools oft=
en produce these kinds of mismatches

It suggests someone copied/past=
ed from different sources

So go=

enuine personal invitation from someone fluent in both languages.

You're Seeing:

 in the upcoming OS update. Apple often shows=
 off:

Real-time translation

Multilingual conversati=

Smart text processing

Cross-language communic=

Why T=

Apple=
 is probably showcasing:

Different translation a=
pproaches
 (literal vs. contextual)

Regional variations
 (the "os" form suggests European Spanish)

Natural language proces=

 that captures tone/feeling rather than exact words

The "=

You'r=

Diffe=
rent cultural approaches to the same invitation! The Spanish version is mor=

So th=
is isn't spam - it's Apple showing off their AI translation understanding c=
ultural context, not just literal word conversion.

its literally on their Ma=

Perfect! That completely expl=

Why Y=

Tech blogs/reviewers

Apple's own marketing

What =
Apple Is Demonstrating:

The i=
mperfect translation you noticed is actually Apple showing off something so=
phisticated - their translation AI understands:

Cultural context
: Spanish speakers might ask "do you feel like coming?" while English spe=
akers ask "can you make it?"

Regional variants
: Using "os" (European Spanish) vs other forms

Conversational tone
: Matching the casual, friendly vibe rather than being robotically lit=

The B=

So yo=
u're not getting spammed - you're just seeing Apple's demo content being sh=

It's actually a pretty clever example because it shows how translation isn'=
