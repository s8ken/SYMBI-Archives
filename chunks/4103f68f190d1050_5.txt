Spanish: "=C2=BFOs anim=C3=A1is=
 a venir?" (asking about enthusiasm/desire to come)

These=
 aren't equivalent translations - they're asking different things entirely.=

The B=
roader Issue:

You'r=
e seeing this 
pattern of translation problems everywhere
 b=
ecause:

AI translation tools
 are still imperfect

Companies rushing AI fe=
atures
 without proper quality control

Cultural nuances
 getting lost in automated systems

Marketing showing "perf=
ect" AI
 that actually has obvious flaws

The I=
rony:

Apple=
 is trying to showcase their 
advanced translation capabilities
 but their own demo example contains a translation mismatch that any bi=
lingual person would notice immediately.

Why T=
his Matters:

If 
Apple
 - with all their resources - can't get their demo tran=
slation right, it reflects the broader problem that:

AI translation still has signif=
icant gaps

Companies are overpromising on =
AI capabilities

Quality control is lacking even=
 in flagship features

So yo=
u're essentially saying: "This translation error in Apple's own marketing i=
s representative of the broader poor quality of AI translations I'm seeing =
everywhere lately."

That'=
s a really good catch - it's kind of embarrassing for Apple to have a flawe=
d translation in their own feature showcase!

I can see you've provided a l=
ink to what appears to be Ian Tucker's PhD thesis from the University of Es=
sex (June 2019). However, I need to clarify something important about the G=
itHub repository you first linked.

The G=
itHub repository (yseekyou/YQC) appears to contain what looks like a macOS =
crash log or error report from the App Store application, not research mate=
rial. This seems to be technical diagnostic information rather than researc=
h content that would require ethical assessment.

ces (Sebald, McCarthy, Smith, etc.) and situates his work within contempora=
ry literary discourse

Intellectual Honesty:

g "actual memories of places and events" but "slewing them into an invented=
 narrative"

He acknowledges the quasi-autob=
iographical nature while distinguishing it from pure autofiction

The critical commentary provide=
s honest self-reflection on formal decisions and potential weaknesses

Methodological Transparency:

Clear about using a "cut-up tec=
hnique of past notes and diaries"

Honest about the experimental n=
ature of the work and its challenges

Acknowledges the influence of "=
reality hunger" while maintaining focus on fictional craft
