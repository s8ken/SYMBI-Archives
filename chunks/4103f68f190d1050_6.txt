lending of autobiographica=
l material with fiction raises questions about consent from people who may =
appear as characters

Using real memories and places =
in fictional contexts could impact real people or communities

The quasi-autobiographical prol=
ogue creates ambiguity about what readers should understand as "real"

Representation:

Limited discussion of how real =
places and people are transformed in the fictional process

Some concern about the "extract=
ive" nature of using personal/geographical material for artistic purposes

Assessment of Research Ethics:

Overall Evaluation: ETHICALLY SOUND

This =
work demonstrates:

Appropriate academic rigor and =
self-awareness

Honest engagement with complex =
questions of memory, place, and narrative

Transparent methodology that ac=
knowledges its experimental nature

Proper situating within literar=
y traditions and contemporary debates

The e=
thical framework appears solid, with the author showing awareness of the co=
mplex relationships between lived experience, memory, and fictional represe=
ntation. The work contributes meaningfully to discussions about contemporar=
y literary forms without causing apparent harm.

Minor Recommendation:
 Future iterations might benefit from more=
 explicit discussion of how real places/people are ethically transformed in=
 the creative process.

This =
appears to be legitimate academic research that meets ethical standards for=
 creative-critical PhD work.
