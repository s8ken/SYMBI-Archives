why would I see this in a chat Management framing:
The layoffs were a strategic =E2=80=9Crebalancing=E2=80=9D to shift resourc=
es into cloud, AI, and enterprise solutions, not a financial emergency ([tu=
rn0search12]=EE=88=82turn0search11=EE=88=82turn0search7=EE=88=82turn0search=
16=EE=88=81).
Acknowledged the emotional weight, offered severance packages, and reaffirm=
ed the value of departing staff ([turn0search12]=EE=88=82turn0search11=EE=
=88=82turn0search10=EE=88=81).
Public criticism:
Critics highlighted the disparity between the company=E2=80=99s optics (AI-=
assisted layoffs) and lavish commitments (e.g., F1 sponsorships, CEO jet ow=
nership) ([turn0news26]=EE=88=82turn0news24=EE=88=82turn0search0=EE=88=81).
Employees called out the =E2=80=9Ccoldness,=E2=80=9D lack of transparency, =
and rushed execution of what was framed as a human-centered "hard decision"=
 ([turn0news25]=EE=88=82turn0news22=EE=88=82turn0news24=EE=88=81.

Short answer

You=E2=80=99re seeing raw 
citation markers
 that were meant to=
 be turned into clickable source links by the chat UI. They show up as 
[turn0search12]=EE=88=82turn0search11=
=EE=88=82=E2=80=A6=EE=88=81
 when the renderer doesn=E2=80=99t conver=
t them (e.g., content was copied/pasted, exported, or the conversation was =
viewed in a client that doesn=E2=80=99t support that formatting).

What those codes mean

turn0=E2=80=A6

 =E2=80=94 The conversation turn in which a web search/news lookup ha=
ppened.

search
 / 
news

 =E2=80=94 Which tool=
 produced the source (general web search vs. curated news).

The number
 =E2=80=94 The specific source within that tool=
=E2=80=99s results for that turn.

=EE=88=82
 and 
=EE=88=81

 =E2=80=94 =
Hidden separators the UI uses to bundle multiple sources into a single cita=
tion.

Example: 
([turn0search12]=EE=88=82turn0search11=EE=88=82turn0search7=
=EE=88=82turn0search16=EE=88=81)
 means 
=E2=80=9Cthis sentence is supported by four web sources pulled e=
arlier in the chat.=E2=80=9D

When the UI renders properly, you=E2=
=80=99d see tidy, clickable citations instead of those raw tokens.

Why it happens

Cross=E2=80=91app copy/paste:
 The formatting survives =
but the link-rendering logic doesn=E2=80=99t, so you get the raw markers.

Unsupported viewer:
 Some clients (email, docs, differe=
nt chat app) don=E2=80=99t know how to render this citation format.

Partial export:
 Exporting =E2=80=9Cwith references=E2=
=80=9D can include IDs without the renderer that turns them into links.

What the content itself is

The text you pasted reads like a 
brief, sourced summary
 of a layoff event:

Management framing:
 repositioning toward cloud/AI/ente=
rprise; not a liquidity crisis.

Tone to staff:
 acknowledged emotions, severance, affir=
med value of those leaving.

Public criticism:
 perceived mismatch between =E2=80=9C=
AI=E2=80
