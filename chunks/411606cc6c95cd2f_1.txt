How I can help

Clean rewrite (no markers):
 I can reformat that passag=
e for sharing=E2=80=94plain text, no citations.

Rebuild the sources:
 I can look up 
current
 reporting and give you proper =
links you can click (note: they may not be the exact same articles tied to =
those internal IDs, but I=E2=80=99ll find equivalent/updated coverage).

Contextualize for comms:
 If you=E2=80=99re drafting an=
 internal note or FAQ, I can turn this into a balanced, audience=E2=80=91ap=
propriate summary with suggested Q&A.

Would you like me to (a) strip the markers and tidy the text, o=
r (b) run a fresh search now and attach live links?

Short version: your Customer GPT is 
showing the raw =E2=80=9Ccitation tokens=E2=80=9D
 tha=
t are normally converted by the ChatGPT UI into tidy, clickable citations. =
When those tokens aren=E2=80=99t interpreted by the viewer (your website/ap=
p, email export, or a different client), they leak through as 
[turn0search12]=EE=88=82=E2=80=A6=EE=88=81
.

Below is what=E2=80=99s going on and=
 how to fix it.

What=E2=80=99s happening

ChatGPT (and GPTs) can attach sources to a message.
 In th=
e official UI these appear as inline citations you can hover/click. Under t=
he hood, the model/tooling returns 
=
structured citation/annotation data
 alongside the text. The ChatGPT UI=
 renders that structure into nice links. If your front=E2=80=91end doesn=E2=
=80=99t handle that structure, you=E2=80=99ll see the raw markers in the te=
xt.

Those markers aren=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cfor users=E2=80=9D; they=E2=
=80=99re renderer hints.
 They look like 
([turn0search12]=EE=88=82turn0news24=EE=88=81)
 becau=

Why your Customer GPT specificall=

Custom front=E2=80=91end (embed/API) isn=E2=80=99t rendering ci=

If you=E2=80=99re using the Responses/Assistants/GPTs APIs (or the website =
embed) and you print 
message.te=

 verbatim, you miss the

annotations/citations
 object that should be rendered as links/footnote=

 field and render it=E2=80=94or strip the markers.

Copy/paste or knowledge files include old tokens.

If you copied content (with citations) from another chat into your GPT=E2=

the model may surface those tokens back to end=E2=80=91users exactly as wri=

Markdown/HTML sanitization or code=E2=80=91block formatting.

Some site frameworks escape or wrap assistant text in 
<code>
/pre tags (or Markdown code fence=
s), preventing the special tokens from being hidden, so they show up litera=
lly.

Alternate client or export.

Viewing a conversation via email, CRM, or an unsupported viewer (or exporti=

How to fix it (pick the path you=

If you built a

Render annotations/citations properly.

Use the structured data that accompanies each text segment (often under
