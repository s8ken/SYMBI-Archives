Use a supported viewer or add a simple post=E2=80=91processor.

Unsupported viewers won=E2=80=99t render citations; either view in ChatGPT,=

Quick questions to pinpoint your =
case

Are you using the 
API/Embed
 (custom front=E2=80=91end)=
 or only a 
Custom GPT
 inside ChatGPT?

Do the raw tokens appear 
only after it searches the web
 or 
always
?

Did you copy text with citations i=
nto your GPT=E2=80=99s 
Instru=
ctions/Knowledge
?

If you share those details (and a =
small snippet of the raw output), I can give you exact code or step=E2=80=

Here=E2=80=99s what that means:

1=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 Where the raw c=
itation tokens come from

Custom GPTs can do 
web searches
 or use 
knowledge files
. When they search, the m=
odel returns structured citations (
turn0search12
, etc.) that the ChatGPT UI usually converts into cli=
ckable footnotes.

If the GPT's 
instructions or knowledge
 contain these token=
s as plain text (for example, copied from another chat), it will repeat the=
m exactly.

If the GPT 
outputs references explicitly
 (like you see), i=
t means it isn=E2=80=99t using the built=E2=80=91in structured citation sys=
tem correctly=E2=80=94likely because its instructions are telling it to quo=
te citations verbatim instead of letting the UI handle them.

2=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 How to know if =
it=E2=80=99s coming from your Custom GPT

You can check:

Test a normal GPT (like me):
 Ask me to summarize news wi=
th sources. Notice how the citations render as hoverable footnotes=E2=80=94=
not 
[turn0search12]
.

Ask your Customer GPT the same:
 If it shows raw marker=
s, the issue is in its 
instru=
ctions or custom behavior
.

3=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 Likely causes=
 inside your Customer GPT

Copied instructions:
 You pasted in text from another c=
hat/export containing 
[turn0sea=

 markers. The model is echoing them.
