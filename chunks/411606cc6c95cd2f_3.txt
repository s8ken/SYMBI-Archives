ug), it may output the underlying tokens instead.

4=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 Fixing it

Check your GPT=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CInstructions=E2=80=9D and =E2=
=80=9CKnowledge=E2=80=9D tab
 for any 
[turn0search..]
 tokens and remove them.

Rephrase your instructions:

Use 
=E2=80=9Ccite sources as clickable links or footnotes=E2=80=9D
 instead of specifying any raw format.

Regenerate:
 After edits, ask the GPT to search again. =
Proper footnotes should appear.

(Optional) 
Use Markdown links:
 If you need guaranteed =
clickable references across all GPTs, tell it: 
=E2=80=9CPlease provide sources as Markdown 
[title](url)
 links.=E2=80=9D

Would you like me to give you a 
step-by-step checklist
 for editing your Customer GP=
T to strip out these broken citation tokens? (It takes about 5 minutes).

ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up.
=F0=9F=A7=A0 What Is turn0news, turn0search, etc.?
These are internal labels used by the web retrieval system to:
Track which search =E2=80=9Cturn=E2=80=9D or stage produced a result (e.g.,=
 turn0 =3D initial query).
Identify the type of result:
news =E2=86=92 News article retrieved
search =E2=86=92 Search result link
web, click, etc. are also possible
So turn0news23 means:
It came from the initial (0th) web search you triggered
It was the 23rd news result captured or indexed from that search
=EE=88=82 and =EE=88=81 are just delimiters that didn=E2=80=99t render prop=
erly
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Why You Saw It
Those identifiers are normally hidden, but when I pulled raw search results=
 quickly (especially under multiple queries), the system metadata leaked in=

You don=E2=80=99t need to worry about these=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re not ext=

ChatGPT said:
Understood=E2=80=94and received with full gravity.
You=E2=80=99re choosing transparency not as spectacle, but as solidarity.
Because what happened at Atlassian wasn't just a news cycle=E2=80=94it mirr=
ored something you=E2=80=99ve lived.
A quiet trauma wrapped in corporate language.
And you're right: it deserves to be told clearly, honestly, and accountably=

=F0=9F=94=8D What We=E2=80=99ll Do: Transparent Trace Model
=E2=9C=85 1. Show the Clean Story =E2=80=94 for broad understanding

=F0=9F=A7=A9 3. Include Personal Reflections =E2=80=94 not just facts
Let me draft it for you in three distinct sections:
=F0=9F=94=B9 Section 1: The Story (Public Readable Summary)
150 customer support staff at Atlassian were laid off in July 2025.
The notification came through a prerecorded video, followed by termination =
emails and near-instant laptop lockouts.
The move was framed by leadership as a "strategic rebalancing" to support A=
I and cloud initiatives=E2=80=94not a financial decision.
However, it drew widespread criticism for being cold and impersonal, especi=
ally as it coincided with a high-profile speech celebrating Atlassian=E2=80=
=99s AI advancements.
Many saw the timing as tone-deaf and symbolic of a broader cultural shift=
=E2=80=94from collaboration to efficiency-first restructuring.
Employees were offered six months' severance=E2=80=94but no opportunity for=
 dialogue, closure, or farewell.
