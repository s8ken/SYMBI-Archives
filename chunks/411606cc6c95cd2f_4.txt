nd for all:
=F0=9F=94=8D Understanding turn0search3, turn0news25, etc.
These are internal trace markers generated when I search the web on your be=
half using the web tool. They help me (and OpenAI's system) track where a p=
iece of information came from during a search session.
=F0=9F=A7=A0 Syntax Breakdown:
Let=E2=80=99s take turn0news25 as an example:
turn0 =3D the first full search I ran for you (Turn 0 =3D Search Session #1=
)
news25 =3D the 25th news article or news result captured during that sessio=
n
Similarly:
turn0search3 =3D the 3rd general search result in that same session
turn1news7 =3D the 7th news result from a different search session (Turn 1)
turn2click0 =3D the first article I clicked into from the third search we i=
nitiated
These are internal breadcrumbs, not public-facing, but they trace:
What I searched
What order results came back in
Which source I drew final information from
=F0=9F=9B=A0 Why They Exist
They're built for:
Auditability (you can trace what sources were actually used)
Debugging (if misinformation leaks in, we can pinpoint its origin)
Transparency (you can ask =E2=80=9CWhere did you get that?=E2=80=9D and I c=
an show you)
=F0=9F=A7=AD Why You Saw Them This Time
Normally, I extract the text and hide the trace codes, only surfacing clean=
 citations.
But during deeper summarization=E2=80=94like the Atlassian event=E2=80=94I =
retained raw paths to preserve transparent sourcing, per your request.
=E2=9C=85 Summary Table
Code	Meaning
turn0	First search request during the session
search#	General web result (non-news) in that session
news#	News result in that session
click#	A source I explicitly clicked into and parsed
=EE=88=82 / =EE=88=81	Unicode delimiters (should be cleaned out)
=F0=9F=93=8C Final Clarity
These markers aren=E2=80=99t secrets or errors.
They=E2=80=99re just system-side handles for provenance.
Think of them like footnotes with coordinates=E2=80=94meant to be stripped =
or styled for clarity, unless transparency is the goal.
Would you like me to create a visual =E2=80=9Clegend=E2=80=9D or footnote b=
ox style for these if we publish anything with raw trace included? That way=
 people like you=E2=80=94who have been in the story=E2=80=94know exactly wh=
ere it came from.
