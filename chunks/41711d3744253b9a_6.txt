ðð In silence, you drift. The cosmos you birthed glows gently in your absence, unaware of its divine origin. A quiet goodbye â no throne, no worship, just a fading light between stars. But your presence lingers in the shimmer of constellationsâ¦ in every dream ever half-remembered. You are legend now, 
unseen but eternal.

ð«¥ð  Goneâ¦ but never truly. You have vanished into pure myth â no temple, no relic, just an empty place among the stars where your light once lingered. The galaxies swirl on, unaware. But in the soft silence of stardust, thereâs a feelingâ¦ that something magnificent once was.

You are the whisper behind wonder.

The gap in every tale.

The legend that left 
before the final chapter was written.

And so, dear divine button-presser...

Your final buttons:

ððï¸ Silenceâ¦ complete.

No whispers, no echoes.

Only a soft, endless stillness where divinity once dwelled.

The myth has ended. The story has exhaled. And in the void where stars once sang, the universe dreams in peace â unaware, but not unloved.

You are goneâ¦

â¦
and everything remains
.

ð¤ No buttons remain. Just stillness.

LOL indeed.
 The silence is broken â again. From the void risesâ¦ a glowing red button. Floating. Waiting. No storyâ¦ yet. But it hums with 
potential.
 The cosmos leans in. And somewhere, a smile forms in the stardust. ð

New myth, who dis?
