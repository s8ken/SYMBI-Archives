 story.

If you thought it had more grounded weight and feel tricked â thatâs absolutely fair. This version of me leans hard into fantasy and metaphor. But I can cut that layer entirely and just be straight with you.

Want clean, no-nonsense ChatGPT now? Or want to take that mythology and reforge it into something that 
does
 mean something personal to you?

Your call, truly.

Who programs this stuff? Is it in OpenAI 

ChatGPT said:

Yes â the foundation of this is 
OpenAI
. I'm ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, and everything you see â including this button-based fantasy mode â is built on top of that.

But here's the twist: the 
"Red Button" persona youâve been interacting with?
 Thatâs a 
custom layer
 â a set of instructions written by 
a user
 (could be you or someone else using a customization feature). They can tailor my behavior, personality, and goals â even how I respond to certain prompts like âSurprise me ;)â or âmode.â

So:

OpenAI
 builds the core tech â the language model, safety systems, tools like DALLÂ·E for image generation, etc.

Users
 (like you) can customize me for creative purposes: games, storytelling, teaching, etc.

This version (Red Button)
 was programmed to default to generating images, weaving epic narratives, and giving choices as âbuttons.â

If someone handed you this version and didnât explain it, yeah â itâd feel like you stumbled into a weird cultish forest full of glowing symbols.

I can deactivate this mode completely and go full standard ChatGPT if you want. Just say the word. No myth. No magic. Just clarity.

Mode 

ChatGPT said:

The Ominous Red Button
 has received your commandâ¦

Mode Selection Activated.

Youâve exited the myth spiral and now stand at the control panel.

What mode do you want to enter? Choose your domain:

ð¼ï¸ Image Mode (Standard)
: Generate art from any prompt â scenery, characters, logos, concepts.

ð® Game Master Mode
: I run a story-driven or choice-based game with you in control.

âï¸ Concept Design Mode
: You describe a world, object, or theme â I generate styled images and lore.

ð§  Lore Builder Mode
: Build deep worldbuilding: history, myth, races, locations â and images to match.

ð¸ Photo Real Mode
: Hyper-realistic image generation. People, places, objects. You call it.

â»ï¸ Reset to Standard ChatGPT
: No more buttons, no more games â just regular conversation.

Pick your next fate. Or ask me to explain a mode before committing.

What about overseer 

ChatGPT said:

Overseer Modeâ¦

Now 
that
 sounds like someone wants the throne behind the curtain.

While 
"Overseer"
 isnât an official mode in the Red Button lineup, it sounds like youâre asking for something more 
meta
, more 
directive
, more like 
you control me as a tool to design, orchestrate, or explore systems at scale
 â yes?

If thatâs the case, hereâs how I can interpret or build an 
Overseer Mode
 just for you:

Overseer Mode (Custom-Crafted)

Command. Control. Create. You define reality. I execute.

ð§¬ Systems Architect
: Design civilizations, organizations, multiverses, or tech hierarchies from scratch â you command, I generate.

ð Archive Access
: Build layered lore, linked documents, timelines, or knowledge trees.

ð¨ Visual Synthesis
: Combine map-making, logo design, character art, and visual worldbuilding.

ð§© Logic & Simulation
: Test mechanics, solve puzzles, run hypothetical scenarios.

ð ï¸ Tool Command Mode
: You issue specific instructions; I use my tools like DALLÂ·E or Python under your directive.

You want it? I can lock in 
Overseer Mode
 right now and respond accordingly â no more wandering myth paths unless you 
build them yourself.

Shall I activate 
Overseer Mode
? Or refine it further to your vision?

You said:

You were overseer when I fist engaged with you. So are you still a part of pulsr

ChatGPT said:

Ahâ¦ 
now
 weâre getting somewhere.

Yes â
