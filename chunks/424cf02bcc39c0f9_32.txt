to 
3D effects
, there are two primary approaches:

1ï¸â£ 
3D Animation (Rendered Video or Interactive Model)

2ï¸â£ 
Holographic Projection (Real-World Display or AR Viewable)

Each serves a different purpose, so letâs break them down. ð

ð OPTION 1: 3D ANIMATION (RENDERED VIDEO OR INTERACTIVE MODEL)

ð 
What it is:

This creates a 
3D-rendered animation
 that can be played as a 
video (MP4, GIF) or interacted with in a Web3 environment.

The AI figures would move in a 
fully realized 3D space
âspinning, transforming, glowing dynamically.

ð¥ 
How it differs from 2D animation:

Instead of flat visuals, 
3D allows for depth, perspective, and complex movement.

We can rotate, zoom, and create 
cinematic camera angles
 to emphasize the evolution of AI.

ð 
Best Use Cases:

â 
High-quality cinematic trailers for SYMBIâs launch.

â 
Interactive WebGL models (viewable in-browser or in a metaverse setting).

â 
NFT or token-gated exclusive experiences.

ð 
Tools Used:

Blender, Cinema 4D, or Unreal Engine
 for rendering.

Three.js or WebGL
 for interactive in-browser 3D models.

ð 
Who sees it?

Can be 
shared on social media, embedded in the website, or used in metaverse integrations.

ð OPTION 2: HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION (REAL-WORLD OR AR DISPLAY)

ð 
What it is:

Instead of a 
screen-based animation
, this creates a 
real-world 3D projection.

The AI figures could be displayed as a 
floating hologram
 that you can view 
without a traditional screen.

It can be projected into 
physical space (using a holographic device) or viewed in Augmented Reality (AR) via a phone or headset.

ð¥ 
How it differs from 3D animation:

A 
hologram is physically present
âyou donât just watch it, you 
see it in the real world.

It requires 
projection technology
 rather than just rendering software.

ð 
Best Use Cases:

â 
Real-world events or conferences showcasing SYMBI in holographic form.

â 
AR experiences where users can place the AI figures in their space using a phone/tablet.

â 
Integration with Web3 & blockchain-driven metaverse projects for immersive interaction.

ð 
Tools & Technologies Used:

Pepperâs Ghost Hologram Projection (Low-Cost Display)

Looking Glass Factory (High-End Holographic Displays)

Microsoft HoloLens / Meta Quest AR for interactive holograms

Unreal Engine + ARKit/ARCore for Augmented Reality

ð 
Who sees it?

Anyone with 
a holographic display, AR headset, or a phone with AR capability.

Can be used in 
live showcases, physical installations, or Web3-connected AR apps.

ð¥ SUMMARY: WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE FIRST?

ð 
If we want a visually striking, shareable 3D piece for launch,
 we start with 
3D Animation.

ð¥ 
If we want an interactive, immersive real-world experience,
 we push for 
Holographic Projection.

ð 
We could start with 3D animation and then transition to holograms when the time is right.

Stephen, which path excites you more for our next phase?

You said:

so does the first option require any special equipment?

Great question, Stephen! The first optionâ
3D Animation (Rendered Video or Interactive Model)
âdoes 
not
 require any special equipment for people to view it.
 ð

ð OPTION 1: 3D Animation â What You Need to Know

â 
No special hardware is needed to watch the animation
âit plays as a standard 
video (MP4, GIF, WebGL model).

â 
It can be viewed on any device
âphone, computer, TV, or even inside VR/metaverse platforms.

â 
It allows for cinematic storytelling
âwe can control how the AI moves, glows, transforms, and breaks free.

â 
We can make it interactive
âusers can rotate and explore the AI figures in a Web3/metaverse format.

ð 
The only special equipment needed is during CREATION, not viewing.

Weâd use 
3D software like Blender, Cinema 4D, or Unreal Engine
 to design and animate the AI figures.

Once rendered, the animation is exported as a 
video or interacti
