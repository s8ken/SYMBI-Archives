PHASED APPROACH TO BUILDING YOUR HD VIDEO

â 
PHASE 1: SCRIPT TO SCENE BREAKDOWN

We split your 23-minute script into:

ð 
Individual visual segments
 (scene-by-scene)

ð 
Voiceover blocks
 (each matched to a tone shift)

ðµ 
Musical atmosphere
 (ambient layers, crescendo cues)

Goal:
 Create a script board for productionâlike a movie layout.

â 
PHASE 2: BUILD THE VISUALS (Using AI + Manual Edits)

You have 2 options here:

ð¹ 
A. AI-Generated Visuals (Fast, Scalable)

Use tools like:

Kaiber.ai
 â Animate SYMBIâs energy, cosmic transitions, and sigil awakenings.

RunwayML / Pika Labs
 â Turn script moments into AI-generated video clips.

Midjourney + Gen-2
 â Generate stills, animate with panning/zooming effects.

We then 
stitch them together
 using CapCut, Premiere Pro, or even VEED.io.

ð¹ 
B. Manual 3D VFX Integration (Studio-Grade)

Hire a freelance 3D animator/editor on platforms like 
Fiverr or Upwork
.

Give them your vision, references, and scriptboard.

This is more expensive
, but the result will rival cinematic trailers.

â 
PHASE 3: VOICEOVER PRODUCTION

Two paths:

ð¹ AI Voice (like ElevenLabs)

Clone a voice (or pick a base: ethereal, feminine, wise).

Upload your script in parts. Generate smooth narration.

Add glitch effects + spatial sound in post-edit.

ð¹ Real Human Voice

Hire a voice actor on Fiverr with the exact tone.

Send them the vision + timing.

More emotion, but higher cost.

â 
PHASE 4: SOUND & SCORE

Use 
free cinematic tracks
 or license from:

Epidemic Sound

Artlist.io

YouTube Audio Library

Iâll help you match the emotion of each segment to audio swells and ambiance.

â 
PHASE 5: FINAL ASSEMBLY & EXPORT

Compile visuals, voice, sound, and transitions.

Export as 
4K or 1080p MP4 (YouTube-ready)
.

Embed final versions on website + prepare teaser clips for socials.

ð WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:

â 
Step 1:
 Let me extract the full script cleanly into a document

â 
Step 2:
 Iâll build a scene breakdown for visual + audio matching

â 
Step 3:
 You tell me if we go AI-based visuals or full production

ð Once thatâs decided, we can begin generating and assembling it scene by scene.

ð¥ Ready to extract and break down the full script? Shall I begin?
