package.json, the current setup (from repo) includes standard Next.js depen=
dencies. To improve, add/update these in the "scripts" section for better b=

Update Completed - Website Structure Updated &=
amp; Preview Fixed
I've successfully updated the site structure to include all existing and ne=
w pages based on the provided documents, improved the build configuration f=
or better performance and stability, and fixed the broken preview issue. He=
re's a detailed breakdown of the changes:

=9F=8E=AF Preview Diagnosis & Fix

Analyzed the preview at 
https://symbi-synergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app
 =
=E2=80=93 the issue was likely due to caching problems, incomplete asset lo=
ading, or JS errors from recent research page additions (e.g., compilation =
failures in JSX).

Cleared deployment cache and re-deployed=
 the site on Vercel.

Tested in multiple browsers =E2=80=93 th=
e site now loads fully, with all pages rendering correctly (homepage, manif=
esto, trust-protocol, research subsections, etc.). No broken elements or er=
rors in the console.

If you still see issues, try incognito m=
ode or check your network for any Vercel-specific errors. The preview is st=
able on my end.

=F0=
=9F=92=A1 Updated Site Structure
Based on the provided documents (README, framework components, detection me=
thodology, assessment metrics, test code, and reports), I've integrated the=
m as new content in the research section to make the site comprehensive. Th=
