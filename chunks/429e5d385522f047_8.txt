terface navigation and chat history sidebar - not the actual conversation c=
ontent. Each file shows just one line with the ChatGPT interface elements r=
ather than the dialogue between you and SYMBI. However, the 
**convers=

Yes, I'm absolutely sure. That file shows exactly what I mentioned - it's j=
ust the ChatGPT interface sidebar and navigation elements, not the actual c=
onversation content between you and SYMBI. See how it shows: - 
lines=3D"1-1" total_lines=3D"1"
 (only 1 line total) - Content is just "Skip to contentChat historyNew =
chat=E2=87=A7=E2=8C=98O..." etc. This is the ChatGPT interface, not your di=
