stat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

What to do:

If you see 
connections to unknown IPs
 or repeated connections to strange addresses, let me know.

🛠 Step 4️⃣: Check for Modified System Files (Rootkits Check)

Run this command to see if system files have been modified:

sh

Copy

sudo find /System/Library/ -

type

 f -

exec

 sh -c 

'ls -lT "$1" | grep -v "Jan 1 2023"'

 sh {} \;

(You may need to enter your 
admin password
.)

What to do:

Normally, system files should 
not be modified recently
.

If you see 
recently changed files
 that don’t match system updates, it could indicate tampering.

🛠 Step 5️⃣: Check if System Integrity Protection (SIP) Has Been Bypassed

We already checked 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 earlier, but let’s confirm there are 
no unauthorized changes
 to your security settings.

Run:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

It should return:

✅ 
"System Integrity Protection: enabled"

Next Steps

Run these commands 
one at a time
, and let me know what you find.

If anything looks suspicious, we can dig deeper into that area.

 → Manages your network drivers.

Siri.app

 → The Siri voice assistant.

WebKit.Networking

🛠 Next Step: Check for Suspicious Startup Items

Now let’s see if anything unusual is launching automatically when you start your Mac.

1️⃣ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons

What this does:

Lists 
all apps, services, and scripts
 that start automatically with macOS.

If we find anything unknown, we can investigate further.

📌 
Run this and let me know the output!

🔍 Summary of Your Startup Items

Your system has 
only Zoom-related startup items
, which are 
normal and not a security risk
:

✅ 
Safe Entries:

us.zoom.updater.login.check.plist

 → Zoom update checker.

us.zoom.updater.plist

 → Keeps Zoom updated.

us.zoom.ZoomDaemon.plist

 → Zoom’s background service.

📌 No unknown or suspicious startup items were found!

🛠 Next Step: Check for Hidden Network Connections

Now let’s see if any unusual 
active network connections
 are present.

1️⃣ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

What this does:

Lists 
all currently active network connections
.

If we see 
connections to unknown IP addresses
, we can investigate further.

📌 
Run this and let me know the results!

You said:

should we expect these zoom updates to occur on every restart? 

ChatGPT said:

Good question! 
Yes, Zoom’s update services are designed to run at startup
 to check for new versions and apply updates automati
