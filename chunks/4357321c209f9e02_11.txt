How Zoom’s Startup Items Work:

us.zoom.updater.plist
 → Runs in the background to check for updates.

us.zoom.ZoomDaemon.plist
 → Ensures Zoom updates apply properly.

us.zoom.updater.login.check.plist
 → Checks for updates when you log in.

Should You Disable These?

If you 
use Zoom often
, it’s fine to leave them.

If you 
don’t want Zoom updating automatically
, you can remove them safely.

🛠 How to Disable Zoom’s Auto-Updates at Startup

If you want to stop Zoom from running at startup, run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomDaemon.plist

This will 
prevent Zoom from checking for updates on every restart
, but Zoom will still work normally.

📌 
Let me know if you want to keep them or disable them!

yes I want to disable as I believe there could be a zoom vulnerability issue at the heart of my Mac problems

Got it! Let’s 
disable Zoom’s auto-updates
 to prevent it from running at startup.

🛠 Step 1️⃣: Remove Zoom's Startup Services

Run the following command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomDaemon.plist

What This Does:

Deletes Zoom’s 
auto-update services
 so they won’t run at startup.

Zoom will 
still work
, but it won’t update automatically.

🛠 Step 2️⃣: Restart Your Mac

After running the command, 
restart your Mac
 to apply the changes:

Click 
 Apple menu > Restart

After restarting, open 
Terminal
 and check if Zoom’s services are gone:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep zoom

Expected Result:

If nothing appears, the Zoom update services are 
successfully disabled
.

If you still see files, let me know and we’ll remove them manually.

📌 
Run the commands and let me know what happens!
 🚀

You said:

ok I'll be back after a restart 

ChatGPT said:

Sounds good! Take your time, and when you're back, run the check to confirm Zoom's update services are gone. Let me know the results! 🚀

You said:

how will we be able to continue the conversation? 

ChatGPT said:

When you come back, just send me a message, and we’ll pick up right where we left off! 🚀

Since I’ve saved the key details (like disabling Zoom updates and checking security issues), I’ll remember where we were.

After restarting, just run this in 
Terminal
 to confirm the Zoom update services are gone:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep zoom

Then let me know what you see! 👍

remember that last step please 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! After restarting, run this in 
Terminal
 to check if Zoom's update services are gone:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep zoom

If nothing appears, Zoom updates are successfully disabled. Let me know what happens after the restart! 🚀

You said:

ok I am back

ChatGPT said:

Welcome back! 🚀 Now, let’s check if Zoom’s update services were successfully removed.

🛠 Step 1️⃣: Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep zoom

🔍 Expected Result:

If nothing appears
 → Zoom updates are successfully disabled. ✅

If files still appear
 (e.g., 
us.zoom.updater.plist
) → We may need to manually remove them. ❌

📌 
Run the command and let me know what you see!

🔍 Result: One Zoom File Still Remains

✅ 
Good news:
 Most of Zoom’s update services are gone.

❌ 
However, 
us.zoom.updater.login.check.plist
 is still present
, meaning Zoom may still check for updates when you log in.

🛠 Step 2️⃣: Remove the Remaining Zoom Update File

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to delete it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.login.check.plist

Enter your 
Mac password
