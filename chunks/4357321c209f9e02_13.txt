🔍 Summary of Your Active Network Connections

Your Mac has 
several established connections
 to different IP addresses. Let’s break them down:

🟢 Likely Safe Connections

✅ 

17.57.145.38.5223

 → 
Apple (Apple Push Notification Service)

✅ 

172.64.155.209

 → 
Cloudflare (used by many websites and services)

✅ 

104.18.41.158

 → 
Cloudflare (also normal)

🟡 Need More Info on These

These are from 
AWS (Amazon Web Services)
 or 
other cloud providers
, which are commonly used for various online services:

3.233.158.26.443
 → Amazon AWS

54.253.168.184.443
 → Amazon AWS

3.105.196.9.443
 → Amazon AWS

If you recently used Google services, Zoom, or any cloud-based apps, these could be 
normal background connections
.

🛠 Next Step: Check Which Apps Are Making These Connections

Now, let’s 
match these connections to the apps or processes using them
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

📌 
What This Does:

Lists 
which apps or processes
 are responsible for these network connections.

Helps us determine if anything unusual is making requests.

🚀 
Run the command and share the results!

🔍 No Results from 
lsof
—What This Means

If 
lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED
 didn’t return anything, that’s unusual because we 
just saw active network connections in 
netstat

.

Possible Explanations:

Temporary network activity
 – The connections may have closed before you ran 
lsof
.

System restrictions
 – macOS security settings (or malware) might be preventing 
lsof
 from displaying results.

A hidden process
 – Some advanced malware can hide network activity from standard monitoring tools.

🛠 Next Step: Run 
lsof
 Differently

Let’s try another method to force 
lsof
 to show all network activity.

1️⃣ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -nP

(Enter your password when prompted.)

📌 
What This Does:

Forces 
lsof
 to list 
all
 network activity, including hidden processes.

Uses 
sudo
 to bypass restrictions.

✅ Expected Result:

A list of apps/processes that have open network connections.

❌ If You Still Get Nothing:

This could indicate 
a deeper system issue or something actively hiding network activity
.

🚀 
Run the command and let me know what shows up!

🔍 Summary of Your Network Connection Check

Your 

sudo lsof -i -nP
 command output
 shows 
only local system processes using network connections
—but 
no established internet connections
 appear.

Key Findings:

✅ 
Normal macOS services detected

airportd

 → Manages Wi-Fi connections.

mDNSResponder

 → Handles local network discovery (AirDrop, Bonjour services).

netbiosd

 → Windows file sharing service (can be disabled if not used).

sharingd

 → Manages file sharing and AirDrop.

❌ 
Suspicious Issue:

netstat

showed active external connections
, but 
lsof
 does 
not
 list which apps are making those connections.

This is 
not normal
—something may be hiding network activity from 
lsof
.

🛠 Next Step: Check for Hidden Connections Using a Firewall Log

Let’s see if macOS’s firewall logs any 
suspicious outbound connections
.

1️⃣ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.network"'

 --info --last 10m

📌 
What This Does:

Lists 
recent network activity
 recorded by macOS.

Can reveal 
hidden processes making network requests
 that 
lsof
 didn’t show.

🚀 
Run this and let me know the results!
