d before we started investigating.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.network"'

 --info --last 24h

📌 
What This Does:

Pulls network activity from the 
last 24 hours
 instead of just the last 10 minutes.

Helps us spot 
suspicious activity that may have stopped recently
.

Run this and let me know what shows up!

it keeps disappearing when I upload it

That’s strange. If the file isn't staying uploaded, you can try these alternatives:

Option 1: Copy & Paste a Sample

If the log is too large, copy 
just a few lines
 from the output and paste them here.

Look for any 
unknown connections, repeated IP addresses, or unusual domains
.

Option 2: Save & Rename the File

Try saving the file as 
a plain text (
.txt
) file
 instead of 
.rtf
.

Rename it to something simple (e.g., 
networklog.txt
) and upload again.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed! 🚀

🔍 Summary of Your 24-Hour Network Log

Your network logs show 
mostly normal macOS system activity
, including:

✅ 
Wi-Fi Connections (
interface: en0[802.11]
)

Your network activity was 
over Wi-Fi
, not Ethernet.

✅ 
Standard macOS Services (
trustd
, 
configd
, 
timed
)

trustd

 → Manages SSL certificates for secure connections.

configd

 → Manages system configuration (network settings, VPN, etc.).

timed

 → Syncs your Mac’s clock using network time servers.

✅ 
DNS & Network Path Checks (
nw_resolver
, 
nw_path_evaluator
)

Your Mac performed 
routine DNS lookups
 to resolve hostnames.

The logs indicate that 
the system was satisfied with the network path
, meaning no interruptions were detected.

⚠️ But What’s Missing?

1️⃣ 
No signs of unusual or excessive outbound traffic.

2️⃣ 
No unexpected external IP addresses or suspicious domains.

3️⃣ 
No clear evidence of a previous security event that would trigger Google’s warnings.

📌 
This supports our theory:
 If something 
was
 happening before, it may have 
stopped
 once we started investigating.

🛠 Next Step: Monitor for Future Suspicious Activity

Since previous suspicious activity may have stopped, let’s 
set up real-time monitoring
 to catch anything unusual 
if it starts again
.

1️⃣ Live Monitor Active Network Connections

Run this command to 
watch live connections
:

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 -c 100 -nn

📌 
What this does:

Captures 
100 real-time network packets
.

Shows which 
IPs your Mac is connecting to right now
.

2️⃣ If Anything Looks Suspicious:

Copy and share 
any unknown or repeated IP addresses
 from the output.

🚀 
Try this and let me know what you find!

You said:

ok yep and also what should my IP address be?

ChatGPT said:

Good question! Your 
IP address
 depends on whether you're checking your 
local (private) IP
 or 
public (external) IP
.

🔍 1️⃣ Check Your Local (Private) IP Address

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ipconfig getifaddr en0

✅ 
Expected result:

Something like 
192.168.1.X
 or 
10.0.0.X
 (depends on your network).

This is your 
private IP
 assigned by your router.

🔍 2️⃣ Check Your Public (External) IP Address

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

curl ifconfig.me

✅ 
Expected result:

A public IP like 
123.45.67.89
 (your internet-facing IP).

This is the IP Google sees when you browse the web.

Why This Matters:

If your public IP keeps changing unexpectedly
, it could indicate 
a VPN, proxy, or ISP issue
.

If your private IP looks unusual
, we should check your network setup.

Try these and let me know what you find!

ChatGPT said:

🔍 Your Public IP: 
163.47.120.68

This is your 
external (public) IP address
, which means it’s the address the internet sees when your Mac makes requests.

🛠 Next Step: Check Where This IP Comes From

Let’s verify if this IP 
matches your ISP
 or if it looks unusual.
