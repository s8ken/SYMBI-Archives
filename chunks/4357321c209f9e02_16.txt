whois 163.47.120.68

📌 
What this does:

Looks up the 
owner of the IP address
 (should be your internet provider).

🚨 Why This Matters:

✅ 
If the IP belongs to your ISP (e.g., Telstra, Comcast, BT, etc.)
, everything is normal.

❌ 
If it belongs to a VPN, data center, or unknown organization
, it could mean:

You're on a 
corporate or cloud-based network
.

Your traffic is being routed through 
a proxy or VPN without your knowledge
.

Someone is 
intercepting or redirecting your traffic
.

🚀 
Run the 
whois
 command and let me know what it says!

163.47.120.68
)

✅ 
Your IP belongs to:

Wireline B and G Pty Ltd
 (Sydney, Australia)

Routed through 
Beagle Internet Pty Ltd
 (also Australia)

🛠 What This Means for You

Does This Match Your ISP?

If 
Wireline B and G
 or 
Beagle Internet
 is your ISP, then this is 
normal
.

If you expected a 
different ISP
, then your traffic 
might be routed through an unexpected provider
.

Are You Using a VPN or Proxy?

If you don’t recognize this network, check:

sh

Copy

scutil --proxy

If it returns 
proxy settings
, your traffic 
may be rerouted without your knowledge
.

Why Did Google Flag This?

If your 
IP is shared
 (e.g., multiple people/devices using it), Google might see 
suspicious traffic
 from other users.

If you 
didn’t change networks but your public IP changed
, it could sugge
