a network issue, ISP rerouting, or a security concern

🛠 Next Step: Check if Your Mac Is Using a Proxy/VPN

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

scutil --proxy

📌 
Expected Result:

If it says 
"None"
, your traffic isn’t being routed through a proxy.

If there’s a proxy 
you didn’t set up
, we need to investigate further.

🚀 
Run the command and let me know what it says!

🔍 Proxy Check Results: No Proxy Detected

✅ 
Your Mac is NOT using a proxy or VPN.

The output only shows 
standard exceptions
 (
*.local
, 
169.254/16
), which are normal.

No unexpected proxy settings
 are redirecting your internet traffic.

🛠 What This Means for Your Google Warning

Since we’ve confirmed:

✅ 
No proxy or VPN is in use

✅ 
Your IP is registered to a real ISP (Wireline B and G / Beagle Internet)

Google’s warnings could be caused by:

A shared IP address
 → If multiple users on this ISP triggered Google’s security systems.

Recent unusual login attempts
 → If your Google account was accessed from unexpected locations.

Temporary ISP routing changes
 → Your provider might have switched IPs dynamically.

🛠 Next Step: Check Google’s Security Alerts Directly

1️⃣ 
Go to

Google's Security Checkup

2️⃣ Look for:

Recent sign-ins from unknown locations

Devices you don’t recognize

Unusual third-party app access

📌 
Check Google’s security alerts and let me know what you find!

alright how would we check what an iPhone on the same network has been doing?

ChatGPT said:

Good question! If you want to check what an 
iPhone on the same network
 has been doing, there are a few ways to monitor its 
network activity, connections, and logs
.

🔍 Step 1: Check the iPhone’s Local Network Activity

On your Mac, you can 
monitor traffic from all devices on the network
, including your iPhone.

1️⃣ Run a Live Network Capture

This will show 
all network requests from devices on your Wi-Fi
, including your iPhone.

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 -c 100 -nn

📌 
What this does:

Captures 
100 real-time network packets
 from all devices on your Wi-Fi.

Shows 
which external servers your iPhone is communicating with
.

✅ What to look for:

Apple servers (e.g., 
17.x.x.x
)
 → Normal iCloud, iMessage, App Store activity.

Google, Facebook, Amazon
 → Normal web services.

Unknown or suspicious IPs
 → Might need deeper investigation.

🚀 
Run this on your Mac and look for any traffic from your iPhone’s IP.

🔍 Step 2: Find Your iPhone’s Local IP Address

To identify your iPhone’s traffic, first find its 
local IP address
:

📱 
On your iPhone:

Open 
Settings > Wi-Fi

Tap your 
Wi-Fi network name

Look under 
IP Address
 (should be something like 
192.168.1.X
)

💻 
On your Mac, verify it:

sh

Copy

arp -a

This lists all devices on your network and their IPs.

Match the IP to your iPhone’s name.

🔍 Step 3: Monitor Just Your iPhone’s Traffic

Once you have your iPhone’s 
local IP
, use this command to capture 
only
 its traffic:

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 host 192.168.1.X -nn

(Replace 
192.168.1.X
 with your iPhone’s actual IP.)

📌 
What this does:

Shows 
only network traffic from your iPhone
.

Helps check if it’s sending unexpected data.

🚀 
Run this and let me know what you find!

🔍 Step 4: Check the iPhone’s App & System Logs

If you suspect 
strange activity on the iPhone itself
, we can look at logs directly from the device.

📱 
On the iPhone:

Go to 
Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements

Tap 
Analytics Data

Look for recent logs from unknown apps or system crashes.

📌 
If anything looks suspicious, screenshot it and we’ll analyze it.
