 activity or suspicious connections.

2️⃣ 
No strange IP addresses or external requests outside of normal Apple/Safari traffic.

3️⃣ 
No excessive data transfers that would indicate spyware, surveillance, or unauthorized access.

📌 
This aligns with our earlier suspicion
: If something unusual 
was happening before
, it may have 
stopped
 as soon as we started investigating.

🛠 Next Step: Monitor Future Network Traffic in Real-Time

Since past logs didn’t show anything unusual, let’s 
actively monitor live traffic
 to see if anything suspicious appears.

1️⃣ Start a Real-Time Network Capture

Run this in 
Terminal
 to watch 
live
 network activity:

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 -c 100 -nn

📌 
What this does:

Captures 
100 real-time network packets
 from your Mac.

Shows 
which external servers your Mac is talking to right now
.

If anything 
looks suspicious
, we can dig deeper. 🚀

🔹 
Run this and let me know what you see!

lets looks at something else - this is the privacy report directly from the iphone

ChatGPT said:

Got it! You've uploaded an 
App Privacy Report
 from your iPhone. This file is in 
NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) format
, which means it contains structured logs of app activity.

🛠 Next Step: Analyze the Privacy Report

I'll process the file and summarize:

Which apps accessed your data
 (location, contacts, microphone, etc.).

Which websites and domains apps connected to
.

Any suspicious or unexpected activity
.

Let me analyze it now. 🚀

🛠 Next Step: Identify Suspicious Activity

Would you like me to:

1️⃣ 
Find apps that accessed sensitive data the most?

2️⃣ 
Check for unusual background activity (apps using mic/camera unexpectedly)?

3️⃣ 
Look for apps making frequent external connections?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed! 🚀
