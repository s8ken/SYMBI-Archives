🔍 Updated Analysis: Google Firebase & Login with Google Activity

Given your concerns about 
Google Firebase
 and 
"Login with Google" being compromised
, I focused on those areas.

🛠 Key Findings

1️⃣ 
Google Firebase was accessed frequently (212 times)

Top Firebase domains contacted:

firebase-settings.crashlytics.com
 (29 times) → Crash reporting

firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com
 (26 times) → App data logging

firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com
 (22 times) → Firebase device tracking

firebaseremoteconfig.googleapis.com
 (16 times) → App feature control

oauth2.googleapis.com
 (10 times) → 
OAuth authentication (linked to Google Login)

2️⃣ 
Google Login Services were accessed 26 times

Top Google Login domains contacted:

oauth2.googleapis.com
 (10 times) → Handles authentication tokens

accounts.google.com
 (8 times) → Google sign-ins

oauthaccountmanager.googleapis.com
 (6 times) → Google Account Manager

accounts.google.com.au
 (2 times) → Google login requests from an Australian domain

🚨 Why This Matters

Firebase is handling a lot of data activity on your device
—this is expected for apps that use Google services, but 
if an app is compromised, Firebase could be used to send or receive unauthorized data
.

Google OAuth (login) activity is present
—this aligns with your concern about 
"Login with Google" being compromised
.

Apps like Grindr and others using Google Login may be affected
—we need to check which apps actually used these services.

🛠 Next Steps: Identify Apps Using These Services

Now, let’s check 
which apps
 accessed Firebase and Google Login.

1️⃣ Extract Apps Accessing Firebase & Google Login

I’ll now:

Match Firebase requests to specific apps

Find which apps triggered Google OAuth requests

🔍 Issue: Apps Using Firebase & Google Login Are Not Identified

Your 
iPhone Privacy Report does not list specific app names
—instead, all Firebase and Google Login requests are grouped under 
"Unknown App"
.

🚨 Why This Matters

We 
know
 Firebase and Google Login were accessed 
frequently
.

But since no apps are named, we 
can’t confirm if Grindr or others specifically made those requests
.

This suggests 
either Apple’s privacy report failed to track app names, or something is hiding them
.

🛠 Next Steps: Manually Check App Connections on iPhone

Since the Privacy Report didn’t log app names, we need to check manually:

📱 
On Your iPhone:

Go to:
 Settings → Privacy & Security → App Privacy Report.

Scroll down to "App Network Activity"

Look for apps frequently accessing:

firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com

oauth2.googleapis.com

accounts.google.com

📌 
Check if Grindr or other apps appear in the list. Let me know what you find!
