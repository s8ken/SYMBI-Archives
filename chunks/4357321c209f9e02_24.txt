🛠 What This Means

You said:

ok so reading that I would say snapchat was the app and it accessed something called picaboo

ChatGPT said:

Not quite—
"Picaboo" is Snapchat’s internal bundle ID.

🔍 Explanation:

com.toyopagroup.picaboo

 → This is 
Snapchat’s app identifier
 (bundle ID).

aws.api.snapchat.com

 → The domain Snapchat connected to (hosted on Amazon Web Services).

"Picaboo"
 was Snapchat’s 
original name
 before it rebranded.

✅ 
So this entry confirms that Snapchat was making network requests.

🛠 Next Step: Search for Grindr & Similar Apps

Would you like me to:

1️⃣ 
Check if Grindr (or similar apps) appear in the report?

2️⃣ 
Analyze whether Snapchat, Reddit, or others contacted Firebase & Google Login?

🚀 
Let me know how you want to proceed!

🛠 Why This Entry Is Different

✅ 
Bundle ID Found:

com.apple.MobileSMS
 (This is iMessage/SMS on iPhone).

❌ 
No actual access count logged
 → This suggests it 
may have been an internal system process
 rather than user-driven action.

❌ 
Identifier (
FDCE...
) is unclear
 → This could refer to a contact, message thread, or internal Apple serv
