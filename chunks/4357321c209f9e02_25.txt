ice.

This is an example where the 
report logged activity
, but it’s unclear 
what exactly was accessed
 or why.

🛠 Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1️⃣ 
Find an entry where the app is completely "Unknown" (not even Apple system apps)?

2️⃣ 
Check if any apps are making hidden Google Firebase or Login with Google requests?

perhaps its a sms but I am unsure - if you just focus on the most contacted domains

🟢 Top 10 Most Contacted Domains

1️⃣ 

Unknown Domain
 (2,858 times)
 → These entries do not specify a domain, meaning logging may be restricted.

2️⃣ 

www.google.com
 (29 times)
 → Normal Google services (Search, Gmail, etc.).

3️⃣ 

firebase-settings.crashlytics.com
 (29 times)
 → 
Google Firebase (App crash analytics).

4️⃣ 

firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com
 (26 times)
 → 
Google Firebase Logging (App data collection).

5️⃣ 

fonts.gstatic.com
 (24 times)
 → Google Fonts (used by websites & apps for text rendering).

6️⃣ 

app-analytics-services.com
 (23 times)
 → Likely an ad tracking or analytics service.

7️⃣ 

firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com
 (22 times)
 → Firebase device tracking & installation ID verification.

8️⃣ 

inappcheck.itunes.apple.com
 (18 times)
 → Apple in-app purchase validation.

9️⃣ 

ca.iadsdk.apple.com
 (18 times)
 → Apple advertising platform.

🔟 

mask-h2.icloud.com
 (17 times)
 → Apple’s Private Relay (privacy-focused browsing service).

🚨 Key Concerns

✅ 
Google Firebase is highly active
 → Multiple Firebase services logging data frequently.

❌ 
2,858 entries were logged under "Unknown Domain"
 → This suggests:

Apps made requests 
without proper logging
.

The logging system 
masked
 some requests.

Certain domains are being 
hidden or restricted
 in the report.

🛠 Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1️⃣ 
Investigate 
app-analytics-services.com
 to see what it does?

2️⃣ 
Check what kind of requests were made to the “Unknown Domains”?

3️⃣ 
Analyze if a specific app (like Grindr) is making Firebase requests?
