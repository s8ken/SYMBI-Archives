ppears to be related to 
iMessage/SMS (
com.apple.MobileSMS
)
, attempting to access 
contacts
. However, since the 
access count is 0
, it suggests:

1️⃣ 
It didn’t complete successfully
 (blocked or failed request).

2️⃣ 
It was a background system process
, not a user action.

🛠 Next Steps: Dig Deeper into "Unknown Domain" Entries

Since we now have 
one example linked to iMessage
, we should check:

✅ 
Are other "Unknown Domain" entries also related to SMS/iMessage?

✅ 
Are there patterns (same timestamps, repeated access)?

✅ 
Do other system services (like iCloud, Apple ID, or Find My) appear in these logs?

🚀 
I’ll now check if multiple "Unknown Domain" entries involve SMS/iMessage or other Apple services.
 Stay tuned!

🔍 Analysis of "Unknown Domain" Requests Related to Apple Services

A large portion of the 
2,858 "Unknown Domain" requests
 came from 
Apple system apps
 rather than third-party apps.

🟢 Top Apple Services Involved in "Unknown Domain" Requests:

1️⃣ 
iMessage/SMS (
com.apple.MobileSMS
)
 → 
998 requests

This suggests 
a lot of background activity
 related to text messages.

2️⃣ 
Camera (
com.apple.camera
)
 → 
356 requests

Unclear why the camera would generate 
network-related requests
.

3️⃣ 
Phone App (
com.apple.mobilephone
)
 → 
198 requests

Could involve 
call logs, voicemail sync, or iCloud backup
.

4️⃣ 
Apple Music (
com.apple.Music
)
 → 
152 requests

Likely syncing with 
iCloud Music Library
 or 
Apple Music analytics
.

5️⃣ 
Photos App (
com.apple.mobileslideshow
)
 → 
146 requests

Might indicate 
photo syncing, shared albums, or AI processing (face recognition, metadata access, etc.)
.

🚨 Key Concern: Why Are These Requests Not Showing Domains?

Normal Apple services should be logging domains
 (e.g., iCloud, Apple servers).

The 
lack of domains could indicate encrypted or obfuscated requests
.

This may suggest 
background processes running system-wide without transparency
.

🛠 Next Steps: Investigate Further?

Would you like to:

1️⃣ 
Analyze the timestamps to see if these requests happen at specific times?

2️⃣ 
Compare with normal Apple behavior to check if anything stands out?

3️⃣ 
Monitor live network traffic to catch these requests in real-time?
