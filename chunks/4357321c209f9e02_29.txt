🔍 Comparison of "Unknown Domain" Requests vs. Normal Apple Behavior

Several 
Apple system apps
 made network requests 
without logging a domain
, which is 
not normal behavior
.

🚨 Apple Services That Should Have Logged a Domain But Didn’t:

1️⃣ 
iMessage/SMS (
com.apple.MobileSMS
)

✅ 
Expected:
 Should connect to 
Apple iMessage servers (apple.com, icloud.com)
.

❌ 
Issue:
 No domains were logged for 
998 requests
—meaning messages might have been processed in a way that hides network activity.

2️⃣ 
Camera (
com.apple.camera
)

✅ 
Expected:
 Should not normally make network requests unless 
uploading photos/videos to iCloud
.

❌ 
Issue:

356 requests were logged without a domain
, which is unusual. If no uploads were happening, why did it generate network activity?

3️⃣ 
Phone App (
com.apple.mobilephone
)

✅ 
Expected:
 May sync call history to iCloud, but should log a connection (e.g., 
icloud.com
).

❌ 
Issue:

198 requests with no logged domain
—meaning it may be transmitting data without transparency.

4️⃣ 
Apple Music (
com.apple.Music
)

✅ 
Expected:
 Should connect to 
Apple Music/iCloud Music Library
 (e.g., 
itunes.apple.com
).

❌ 
Issue:

152 unknown requests
—if Apple Music was 
not actively being used
, this is odd.

5️⃣ 
Photos (
com.apple.mobileslideshow
)

✅ 
Expected:
 Should access 
iCloud Photos
, logging requests to 
iCloud.com
.

❌ 
Issue:

146 requests had no domain logged
—suggesting photo-related network activity was happening, but its destination is hidden.

🛠 Key Concerns & Possible Explanations

Some of these could be normal Apple system processes
 that failed to log correctly.

If Apple’s logging was intentionally blocked (e.g., Private Relay, VPNs, or encryption), that could explain missing domains.

If you didn’t use iMessage, Camera, or Music at the time, these requests are suspicious.

🛠 Next Steps

Would you like to:

1️⃣ 
Check timestamps to see if these unknown requests happen at specific times?

2️⃣ 
Run a live network capture to catch similar hidden requests in real time?

3️⃣ 
Investigate whether a VPN, Private Relay, or security tool is blocking domain logging?

okay so what I want to do is compare the exact same report for the observations we have already made but using the iPad report attached. keeping in mind that the iPad is used about 20% of the usage time the iPhone would be at best

Got it! I'll now process the 
iPad report
 and compare it directly to the 
iPhone report
, keeping in mind:

The iPad is used about 20% as much as the iPhone
, so we expect fewer overall requests.

We will look for the same patterns we found on the iPhone
, including:

"Unknown Domain" requests
