SB logging or system integrity is compromised.

macOS should list even built-in USB devices (e.g., internal keyboard on MacBooks), so something may be interfering.

🚨 Next Steps: Dig Deeper

1️⃣ Check if USB Devices Are Being Blocked

Try resetting the USB subsystem:

sh

Copy

sudo killall -STOP -c usbd && sudo killall -CONT -c usbd

Then rerun:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

If devices 
still don’t appear
, something may be interfering.

2️⃣ Check for USB Driver or Hardware Issues

Run:

sh

Copy

kextstat | grep -i usb

This lists active USB-related kernel extensions. Look for anything 
unusual
 or missing.

3️⃣ Check for Unauthorized Processes Running

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i usb

If any unknown processes related to USB appear, it may be an issue.

4️⃣ Check System Logs for USB Errors

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.iokit.usb"'

 --info --last 1h

This will reveal if macOS is detecting any USB-related issues.

🚨 If You Still Suspect Compromise:

Try booting into Safe Mode
 (
Shift
 on startup) and rerun the USB checks.

Create a new macOS user account
 and test USB detection there.

Consider running a malware scan
 (Malwarebytes or KnockKnock).

If things still look suspicious, a full macOS reinstall may be safest.

Let me know if you find anything unusual from these tests! 🚨

no it seams the command didn't do anything for

If the command didn't return any output, that could indicate one of the following:

USB Devices Are Not Detected
 – Either nothing is plugged in, or something is preventing macOS from listing USB devices.

A Rootkit or Malware May Be Hiding USB Activity
 – Some advanced threats can block USB enumeration.

macOS May Have USB Issues
 – A corrupted driver or system bug could be affecting USB detection.

🚨 Next Steps to Investigate Further

1️⃣ Check USB Detection in Safe Mode

Safe Mode disables third-party extensions and malware that might be hiding USB devices.

Restart your Mac and hold down 
Shift

 until you see the login screen.

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

If USB devices appear in Safe Mode but not in normal mode, something is interfering with USB detection.

2️⃣ Check for Missing or Corrupted USB Drivers

Try reloading USB drivers manually:

sh

Copy

sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBHostFamily.kext

Then re-run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

If you see errors, the USB driver might be corrupted.

3️⃣ Check if USB Services Are Running

Run the following to check for USB-related processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i usb

If no USB-related processes are running, something might be blocking them.

4️⃣ Reset SMC & NVRAM (Mac Firmware)

Corrupted firmware settings can block USB device detection. Try these:

For Intel Macs:

Shut down your Mac.

Hold 
Shift + Control + Option + Power
 for 10 seconds.

Release and power it back on.

For Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs:

Shut down your Mac.

Hold the 
Power button
 until you see "Loading startup options."

Select 
Options > Continue
 and check if USB works.

5️⃣ Scan for Rootkits

If malware is hiding USB devices, a scan may reveal it. Try:

Install 
KnockKnock
 (
objective-see.com
) and scan for persistent malware.

Run 
Malwarebytes
 to check for infections.

🚨 If Nothing Works

If all USB devices remain invisible, and none of the above solutions work:

Consider a full macOS reinstall.
 This rules out software-based threats.

Check USB ports physically.
 If your Mac was tampered with, a hardware device might be attached inside.

Step 1️⃣: Boot into Safe Mode & Check USB Devices

Safe Mode disables unnecessary system extensions, including malware that could be interfering with USB detection.

How to Boot into Safe Mode:

On an Intel Mac:

Shut down your Mac completely
 (not restart).

Turn it bac
