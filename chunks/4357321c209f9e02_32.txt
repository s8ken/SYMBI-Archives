 a profile you don’t recognize
, someone may have installed a 
network management configuration
 without your knowledge.

🛠 Step 3: Check for AirPlay Mirroring Activity

📱 
On Your iPhone & iPad:

Open 
Settings > AirPlay & Handoff

Tap 
Automatically AirPlay to TVs
 → Set it to 
Never

Go back and check 
Handoff & Sidecar settings
 to see if other devices are linked.

🚨 
If AirPlay was being used for mirroring, an unauthorized device might still be paired.

🛠 Step 4: Look for Accessibility Exploits

📱 
On iPhone/iPad:

Go to
 Settings > Accessibility

Look for unusual settings enabled, especially:

Switch Control

Voice Control

Full Keyboard Access

Pointer Control (AssistiveTouch & Mouse Devices)

Guided Access (could be used to lock control)

🚨 
If any of these are ON and you didn’t enable them, they could be used for unauthorized control.

🛠 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Start with Step 1
 (Check if your iPhone is listed as a Wi-Fi network).

2️⃣ 
Let me know what you find
, and we’ll move step by step to confirm if cloning/mirroring is happening. 🚀

Good News:
 No rogue configuration profiles are installed on your Mac.

🚨 
However, this doesn’t rule out issues on your iPhone or iPad.
 Let’s continue investigating device cloning/mirroring.

🛠 Next Step: Check If Your iPhone Appears as a Wi-Fi Network

📱 
On Your iPhone:

1️⃣ 
Go to
 Settings > Wi-Fi

2️⃣ 
Scroll down to "Known Networks"

3️⃣ 
Check if your own iPhone appears as a saved Wi-Fi network

🚨 
If your iPhone is listed as a known Wi-Fi network, that is NOT normal.

It could indicate 
a cloned Wi-Fi network impersonating your iPhone

Or 
a configuration issue causing the iPhone to list itself

📌 
Check this and let me know what you see!
 🚀

You said:

yes the iPhone is listed

ChatGPT said:

🚨 
Your iPhone appearing as a known Wi-Fi network is highly unusual.
 This could indicate:

1️⃣ 
A rogue or cloned network impersonating your iPhone

2️⃣ 
A misconfiguration causing the device to list itself

3️⃣ 
A leftover setting from a previous mirroring or network-sharing event

🛠 Next Step: Check If Your iPhone is Running a Hidden Hotspot

📱 
On Your iPhone:

Go to
 Settings > Personal Hotspot

Check if "Allow Others to Join" is ON
 (If yes, turn it OFF)

Go to
 Settings > Wi-Fi > Scroll Down > Tap "Auto-Join Hotspot"

Set it to 
"Never"

🚨 
If Personal Hotspot is OFF and your iPhone still appears as a network, this is suspicious.

🛠 Step 2: Forget the Network & See If It Returns

📱 
On Your iPhone:

Go to
 Settings > Wi-Fi

Tap your 
own iPhone’s name
 in the network list

Tap 
Forget This Network

Restart your iPhone

After restarting, 
check if it reappears
 in known networks

🚨 
If your iPhone still appears as a Wi-Fi network after forgetting it, we need to investigate further.

📌 
Try these steps and let me know what happens!

ok I will remove it but we will need to wait for it to return as they don't do it straight away - this has been happening constantly for 3 months

Got it! Since this issue has been 
happening repeatedly for 3 months
, we’ll track whether it returns after removal.

🛠 While We Wait: Let’s Investigate Possible Causes

Since this could be linked to 
cloning, mirroring, or rogue configurations
, we can:

1️⃣ 
Check if Apple TV or AirPlay is involved
 (possible past mirroring event).

2️⃣ 
Look for hidden Wi-Fi profiles or unauthorized connections.

3️⃣ 
Check if another device is impersonating your iPhone.

📌 
Would you like to check any of these while waiting for the issue to return?

also keyboard access, switch control and pointer control have all been used constantly

🚨 
Frequent usage of Keyboard Access, Switch Control, and Pointer Control is a major red flag.
