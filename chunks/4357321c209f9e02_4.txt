 when you see the login screen.

On an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac:

Shut down your Mac completely
.

Hold down the 
Power button
 until you see "Loading startup options."

Select your startup disk, then

Once in Safe Mode:

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

If USB devices 
show up
 here but didn't before, that means something is blocking them in normal mode.

If the command still 
shows nothing
, let me know. That would suggest a deeper system issue or firmware-level interference.

Try this step and let me know what you find! 🚀

Understood! Let's go one step at a time.

Step 1️⃣: Check USB Devices in Safe Mode

This will help determine if something is blocking USB detection in normal mode.

How to Boot into Safe Mode:

Are you using an Intel Mac or an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac?

If you're not sure, click 
 (Apple menu) > About This Mac
 and check under "Chip" or "Processor."

Let me know which one you have, and I’ll guide you through the correct steps. 🚀

ChatGPT said:

Apple 
M1 Pro
 was released in

2013 Mac
, it would have an 
Intel
 processor instead.

Can you double-check? Here’s how:

Click 
 (Apple menu) > About This Mac
.

Look under 
Chip
 (for M1/M2) or

before we do that I want to go back to checking the usb devices please

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Let's check your USB devices again.

Step 1️⃣: Check USB Devices

Open 
Terminal
 (Go to 
Applications > Utilities > Terminal
) and type the following command:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Then press Enter.

This will list all connected USB devices. After running the command:

If you see a list of devices, copy and paste the output here.

If nothing appears, let me know.

Try this and tell me what you see! 🚀

You said:

and yes its a 2023 

ChatGPT said:

Update memory? 

“Has a 2023 M1 Pro Mac”

Yes

No

Thanks for confirming! Now, go ahead and run the USB check in Terminal:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Let me know what appears! 🚀

ChatGPT said:

Your USB device list only shows the 
built-in USB controllers
 (
AppleT6000USBXHCI
), but 
no external USB devices
 are detected.

What This Means

If you don’t have any USB devices plugged in, this is normal.

If you do have USB devices connected (keyboard, mouse, flash drive, etc.) but they don’t show up, this is suspicious.

It could indicate 
a system issue
 (corrupted drivers, hardware failure) or 
malware hiding devices
.

Next Step: Test USB Device Detection

Let's check if your Mac 
detects a USB device
 when you plug it in.

Step 1: Plug in a Known USB Device

Use a USB flash drive, wired keyboard/mouse, or any USB accessory.

Step 2: Run This Command Again

After plugging it in, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l
