🛠 What’s Missing?

❌ 
The unauthorized "m" account does not appear here.

❌ 
We don’t see any other unknown users actively logged in.

However, this only shows 
active users and user shells
. 
To confirm if "m" still exists in the system, we should run:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep m

📌 
Would you like to do that now to check if "m" is still in the system?
