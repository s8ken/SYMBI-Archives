he device appears, macOS is detecting it properly.

If the device 
still doesn’t show up
, something may be blocking USB detection.

Run this test and let me know what happens! 🚀

are you sure? that looks like a lot of information in that file to say basically nothing? can you summarise the file for me before we proceed to the next step?

You're absolutely right to double-check! Here's a 
summary
 of your USB device log:

Only Built-in USB Controllers Are Detected

Your Mac lists 
AppleT6000USBXHCI
 controllers, which are part of its internal USB system.

No external devices (like flash drives, keyboards, or mice) appear in the log.

No Vendor or Product Information Found

Normally, USB devices show 
vendor IDs
, product names, and connection details.

Your log doesn’t contain any of that—suggesting no USB devices are recognized.

System Data is Present but Not USB-Specific

The log includes 
a lot of unrelated system info
, such as kernel diagnostics and hardware details.

This makes it look long, but 
there’s no actual list of external USB devices
.

What This Means

If no USB devices were plugged in, this is expected.

If you had devices connected but they don’t show up, it could mean:

A software issue (USB drivers not working).

Malware hiding USB activity.

A hardware problem with the USB ports.

Would you like to continue with the next step (testing USB detection by plugging in a device)? 🚀

no that's great information for me as I mentioned I don't really know this stuff but its a great way to learn

Updated saved memory

That's awesome! I’ll make sure to explain things in a way that helps you learn while troubleshooting.

Would you like to proceed with the next step—
testing USB detection with a plugged-in device
—or do you have any questions about what we found so far? 🚀

Great! Now let’s check if your Mac detects a 
USB device when it’s plugged in
.

Step 1️⃣: Plug in a Known USB Device

Use a 
USB flash drive, wired keyboard/mouse, or any other USB accessory
.

Plug it directly into your Mac’s USB-C or USB-A port (avoid using a hub for now).

Step 2️⃣: Check If macOS Detects It

Once the device is plugged in, open 
Terminal
 and type:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Then 
press Enter
.

Step 3️⃣: Look for Changes

If the device 
appears
, macOS is detecting it properly.

If the device 
still doesn’t show up
, something may be blocking USB detection.

📌 Let me know what you see!
 If there’s a lot of output, you can copy and paste it here or save it to a file and share it. 🚀

File

here you go

ChatGPT said:

Your new USB device log 
still does not show any external USB devices
, even after plugging one in.

Summary of Findings:

Only Built-in USB Controllers Are Detected

The output still only shows 
AppleT6000USBXHCI
, which is your Mac's internal USB controller.

No external USB devices (flash drives, keyboards, etc.) appear.

Possible Reasons:

Hardware issue:
 Your Mac’s USB ports may not be working.

Software issue:
 A driver problem could be preventing macOS from detecting USB devices.

Security or malware issue:
 Something may be hiding USB activity.

Next Step: Check If macOS Detects USB Devices Another Way

Step 1️⃣: Open System Information

Click 
 Apple menu > About This Mac
.

Click 
More Info... > System Report
 (at the bottom).

On the left, select 
USB
 under the "Hardware" section.

Step 2️⃣: Look for Your USB Device

If your device 
appears
 here but not in Terminal, that suggests a software or logging issue.

If your device 
still doesn’t appear
, it could be a deeper USB detection issue.

Let me know what you find! 🚀

oh sorry 

ChatGPT said:

No worries at all! Let me know what you find in 
System Report
 or if you want me to clarify anything. I'm happy to guide you through it! 🚀

I'll plug one in

Perfect! Plug in a 
USB device
