 
System Report
 to see if macOS detects it:

Click 
 Apple menu > About This Mac

Click

Let me know if it shows up! 🚀

You said:

shall I just run that command again when I insert it?

ChatGPT said:

Yes! After plugging in the USB device, run the command again in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Then press 
Enter
 and check if the device appears. If it still doesn’t show up, we’ll try 
System Report
 next.

Let me know what happens! 🚀

Your latest USB check 
still does not show any external USB devices
, even after plugging one in.

Summary of Findings:

Only Built-in USB Controllers Are Detected

Your Mac still only lists 
AppleT6000USBXHCI
, which is its internal USB controller.

Your plugged-in USB device does not appear in the log.

Possible Causes:

Hardware issue
 – The USB port or device might be faulty.

Software issue
 – macOS might not be recognizing USB devices properly.

Security/Malware issue
 – A rogue process could be blocking USB detection.

Next Step: Use System Report to Check USB Devices

Let’s check if macOS detects the USB device another way.

Step 1️⃣: Open System Report

Click 
 Apple menu > About This Mac
.

Click 
More Info... > System Report
 (at the bottom).

On the left sidebar, select 
USB
 under the "Hardware" section.

Step 2️⃣: Look for Your USB Device

If it 
appears
 there, but not in Terminal, it may be a software issue.

If it 
still doesn’t show up
, there may be a USB failure or malware issue.

Let me know what you see in System Report!

Your 
third USB check
 still does 
not
 show any external USB devices, even after plugging one in. The output only lists internal system components, but 
no actual USB devices are detected
.

🔍 Summary of What We Found

Your Mac recognizes the built-in USB controllers
 (
AppleT6000USBXHCI
).

Your plugged-in USB device does not appear
, meaning macOS is 
not detecting it at all
.

This could be caused by:

A faulty USB port or cable

A software issue (macOS failing to detect USB devices)

A security issue (malware or system restrictions blocking USB detection)

🛠 Next Step: Check USB Devices in System Report

Since Terminal isn’t detecting USB devices, let’s check if macOS recognizes them another way.

Step 1️⃣: Open System Report

Click 
 Apple menu > About This Mac
.

Click 
More Info... > System Report
 (at the bottom).

In the 
left sidebar
, click 
USB
 under "Hardware".

Step 2️⃣: Look for Your USB Device

If the device appears here:
 macOS is detecting it, but there might be a software issue in Terminal.

If it’s still missing:
 The USB port, cable, or software might be malfunctioning.

🔍 Summary of Your USB Results

Your 
System Report (USB section) shows multiple devices
, meaning macOS 
is detecting them properly
.

🖥 Devices Detected:

USB Hubs (Genesys Logic & Terminus Tech)

Likely part of a 
USB dock or hub
 you’re using.

USB 10/100/1000 LAN Adapter (Realtek)

This appears to be a 
USB Ethernet adapter
.

YubiKey FIDO (Yubico)

A 
hardware security key
, if you own one.

USB Type-C Digital AV Adapter

Possibly a 
USB-C to HDMI adapter
 for external displays.

✅ Good News:
 macOS is detecting your USB devices properly 
at the system level
.

⚠️ However:
 These devices 
were not appearing in Terminal logs
, which suggests:

A 
software issue
 preventing 
ioreg
 from displaying USB devices.

A 
security setting or malware hiding USB activity from Terminal
.

🛠 Next Step: Cross-check Terminal & System Report

Let’s now check if the same devices show up in Terminal using a different method.
