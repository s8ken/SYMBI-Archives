in Terminal

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

What this does:

It 
pulls the same USB data from System Report
 and displays it in Terminal.

If your devices 
appear here but not in 
ioreg

, it confirms a logging issue.

Step 2️⃣: Let Me Know What Shows Up

If devices 
appear
, then 
ioreg
 isn’t displaying them properly, but macOS still sees them.

If devices 
do not appear
, we may need to check for deeper security issues.

Give this a try and let me know what happens! 🚀

yes so I have 1 usb hub connected using one of the usb c ports the others are all ree

ChatGPT said:

Thanks for confirming! Since you have 
only one USB hub connected
, but 
multiple USB devices
 showed up in the System Report, this means the hub itself is detecting and presenting those devices to macOS.

🔍 What This Tells Us:

✅ 
Your USB ports are working
 – since macOS detects the hub and devices plugged into it.

❌ 
Terminal (
ioreg
) still doesn’t show USB devices
 – which is unusual.

🛠 Next Step: Run This Terminal Command

Now, let's check if 
macOS security settings or software restrictions
 are affecting USB logging.

1️⃣ Open Terminal and type:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

Then press 
Enter
.

2️⃣ What to look for:

If it says 
"System Integrity Protection: enabled"
, macOS security settings are active.

If it says 
"disabled"
, it could mean a security change or possible tampering.

📌 Let me know what it says!

🔍 System Integrity Protection (SIP) Status: ENABLED

✅ 
Good News:
 Your Mac’s 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled
, which means critical system files are protected from unauthorized modifications.

⚠️ 
However, Terminal (
ioreg
) still isn’t showing USB devices, even though System Report does.
 This suggests:

A 
macOS logging issue
 – something is preventing 
ioreg
 from listing devices.

A 
security setting or software bug
 – blocking USB details in Terminal.

(Less likely) 
Malware or tampering
 – though SIP being enabled reduces this risk.

🛠 Next Step: Force Refresh USB Detection

Now, let's 
restart the USB subsystem
 and check if Terminal starts detecting devices.

1️⃣ Run This Command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo killall -STOP -c usbd && sudo killall -CONT -c usbd

(You’ll be asked for your password—type it and press 
Enter
.)

2️⃣ After That, Run This Again to Check USB Devices:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

📌 
Let me know if your USB devices now appear in the Terminal output!

🔍 Summary of Your Latest USB Check

Unfortunately, 
the 
ioreg
 command still does not list your external USB devices
. Instead, it mostly shows 
system-level information and internal components
, but 
no external USB devices appear
 in the Terminal output.

✅ Good News:

Your USB devices 
are detected in System Report
, meaning macOS does recognize them.

System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled
, reducing the risk of system tampering.

⚠️ However:

Terminal (
ioreg
) still isn’t showing USB devices
, which is unusual.

This could indicate:

A macOS logging issue
 (possibly a software bug).

A security setting blocking Terminal from seeing USB data
.

Less likely: Malware interfering with USB logs
.

🛠 Next Step: Test Another USB Logging Method

Let's try another Terminal command to 
check if USB devices appear differently
.

1️⃣ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

What this does:

This retrieves 
USB device details directly from macOS
, similar to System Report.

If your devices 
appear here but not in 
ioreg

, it confirms a logging issue.

If they 
still don’t appear
, then something is actively blocking USB detection in Terminal.

2️⃣ Let Me Know What Shows Up

If your devices 
appear
, then it's just an issue with 
ioreg
.

If your devices 
don’t appear
, we may need to dig deeper into s
