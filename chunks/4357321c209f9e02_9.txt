Instead of only listing USB controllers, it 
searches for all USB-related services
.

If devices appear here, then 
ioreg
 is just filtering them in the original command.

If devices 
still don’t appear
, we may need to adjust system logging settings.

2️⃣ Let Me Know What Shows Up

If USB devices 
appear
, we confirm that 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 is just filtering them out.

If USB devices 
still don’t appear
, we may need to check system security settings.

🔍 Summary of Your Latest USB Check (
ioreg -p IOService -w0 | grep -i usb
)

✅ 
Now your USB devices are showing up in Terminal!

Your latest test 
confirms
 that 
ioreg

can
 detect your USB devices—just not with the original 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command.

🔑 What We Learned:

USB devices are recognized by macOS
 (System Report shows them).

USB devices now appear in Terminal when using 
ioreg -p IOService

.

The original 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command likely filters out certain devices
, which explains why they didn’t show before.

🛠 Next Step: Verify What’s Missing from 
ioreg -p IOUSB

Let’s compare both outputs to confirm why 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 wasn’t showing your devices.

1️⃣ Run This in Terminal Again:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

2️⃣ Compare to Your Previous 
ioreg -p IOService
 Output:

Do 
any
 USB devices that showed in 
IOService

still not appear
 in 
IOUSB
?

If 
IOUSB
 is still missing devices, it’s likely a logging filter issue.

🔍 Summary of Your Latest USB Check (
ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l
)

Even after testing again, 
the 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command still does not list your external USB devices
—only the internal USB controllers.

What We Confirmed:

✅ 
System Report detects all USB devices correctly

✅ 
The 
system_profiler SPUSBDataType
 command also lists USB devices

✅ 
The 
ioreg -p IOService
 command lists USB devices

❌ 
The 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command still does not show any external USB devices

This suggests that 

ioreg -p IOUSB
 is filtering out certain USB details
 rather than your system having a hardware issue.

💡 Conclusion: Your USB System Works, but 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 May Be Limited

The fact that 
other commands show your USB devices
 but 

ioreg -p IOUSB
 does not
 strongly suggests that macOS 
is filtering certain USB logs in this command
.

It does 
not
 indicate a compromise or major issue—just a difference in how USB data is logged.

If you ever need to check USB devices in the future, the 
better Terminal command is:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

This gives a 
full list of all connected USB devices
, just like System Report.

lets look more broadly are the security issues

🔍 Broader Security Check for Your Mac

Now that we've ruled out major USB issues, let's check for 
other possible security risks
, including malware, unauthorized processes, and system integrity.

🛠 Step 1️⃣: Check for Unknown Background Processes

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to list all running processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -v 

'\['

 | less

What to do:

Look for any 
suspicious process names
 (random strings, unknown apps, etc.).

Scroll through the list using the 
arrow keys
; press 
Q
 to exit.

If anything looks unfamiliar, copy the name and share it here.

🛠 Step 2️⃣: Check for Suspicious Startup Items

Run this to list all login items and startup agents:

sh

Copy

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons

What to do:

If you see 
weird or unknown items
, copy them here.

Common safe entries include 
com.apple.*
, 
com.google.*
, 
com.microsoft.*
, and security apps like Malwarebytes.

🛠 Step 3️⃣: Scan for Hidden Network Connections

Run this command to list 
active network connections
:

sh

Copy

net
