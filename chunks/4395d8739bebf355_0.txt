so home brew and a whole bunch of other things got installed without my knowledge 
we need to see what they were up to

ChatGPT said:

Let's methodically investigate what was installed and identify their purpose.

Step 1: Check Installed Homebrew Packages and Dependencies

Open Terminal and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew list

To see packages along with install dates (crucial evidence):

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -lt /opt/homebrew/Cellar

or if Intel-based Mac:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -lt /usr/local/Cellar

This command will list installed Homebrew packages, sorted by recent installations.

Step 2: Review Homebrew Installation Logs for Activity History

Check Homebrew's logs:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/Library/Logs/Homebrew/*.

log

Reviewing these logs may reveal exactly what was installed, when, and potentially by whom.

Step 3: Review Shell History for Suspicious Commands

Check your shell history for unusual activities:

bash

Copy

Edit

history

 | grep brew

history

 | grep curl

history

 | grep git

This helps identify commands potentially used by attackers.

Step 4: Verify Homebrew Configuration and Custom Taps

Run this to list custom sources ("taps"):

bash

Copy

Edit

brew tap

Attackers may add malicious taps for persistence.

Step 5: Check for Suspicious Services Managed by Homebrew

Identify Homebrew-managed services:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew services list
