for hidden services potentially giving attackers remote control or data exfiltration capabilities.

Step 6: Check Cron Jobs or Launch Agents for Persistence

Check cron jobs:

bash

Copy

Edit

crontab -l

And launch agents or daemons (common attacker persistence):

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/LaunchDaemons

Inspect contents of suspicious 
.plist
 files by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<suspicious-file>.plist

Step 7: Scan for Recently Modified or Created Files in System Directories

Search for suspicious file activity in important folders:

bash

Copy

Edit

find /usr/local/bin /opt/homebrew/bin -mtime -30 -

exec

ls

 -ld {} \;

This shows files modified within the past 30 days.

Next Steps:

Perform these checks carefully and provide any suspicious findings here. I'll guide you through the analysis and removal steps based on what we find.

Here's what the investigation reveals so far:

Key Findings:

1. Homebrew itself is no longer present (or never was properly installed):
