No Homebrew installation detected at expected paths (
/opt/homebrew
 or 
/usr/local
).

The command 
brew
 itself does not exist, nor does any Cellar directory.

However, you see history entries attempting to run 
brew
.

These entries (
brew list
, 
brew doctor
, etc.) indicate that someone or something previously attempted Homebrew commands or referenced its paths, but no actual working Homebrew installation is currently present.

This suggests either:

A failed or incomplete attacker installation/removal attempt
, or

The attacker ran commands or scripts that referenced Homebrew, but the system itself never properly installed it
, or it was cleaned afterward.

2. Shell History Anomalies:

Entries like 
/opt/homebrew/var/log
 and attempts to run Homebrew commands suggest the presence of scripts or commands that expected Homebrew to exist.

3. Suspicious LaunchAgents:

You found several entries here:

bash

Copy

Edit

~/Library/LaunchAgents:
  com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist
  com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper.plist
  com.bitgapp.eqmac.helper.plist
  com.cleverfiles.cfbackd.plist
  com.netgear.agent.plist
  us.zoom.updater.login.check.plist
  us.zoom.updater.plist
  com.netgear.antivirusformac.plist
  com.netgear.upgrade.plist
  com.objective-see.blockblock.plist
  com.objective-see.ransomwhere.plist
  us.zoom.ZoomDaemon.plist

These LaunchAgents belong to:

Apple AirPlay
: Could relate to previously reported AirPlay-based issues.

Zoom
: Legitimate but frequently targeted for persistence.

Netgear Agents & Antivirus
: Likely related to your Netgear router or software.

Objective-See Tools (BlockBlock and RansomWhere)
: These are legitimate security tools, suggesting either you or someone else installed them.

Bitgapp eqMac
 (audio management): Potentially legitimate, but verify if you recognize installing this.

Cleverfiles (Disk Drill)
: Common recovery software. Check if knowingly installed.

None inherently malicious by default, but Zoom and AirPlay items should be investigated further, given your previous reports of AirPlay-related compromise.

Next Steps to Narrow this Down:

â 
Step 1: Check for Homebrew remnants explicitly

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

find / -name 

"*homebrew*"

 2>/dev/null

â 
Step 2: Inspect Zoom & AirPlay LaunchAgent files closely

Check each suspicious plist for scripts or unusual file references:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist

cat

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist

â 
Step 3: Investigate further AirPlay processes and logs:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS[c] "AirPlay"'

 --last 7d

â 
Step 4: Review if Objective-See tools were installed by you:

BlockBlock
 and 
RansomWhere
 are excellent security tools, but you should verify if you or an attacker installed them to monitor/control your system.

Visit: 
objective-see.org
 to verify the legitimacy of these tools.

Recommended immediate follow-up:

Provide output from the above steps.

Confirm if you recognize installing 
Objective-See tools (BlockBlock, RansomWhere)
, 
eqMac
, 
Disk Drill
, or 
Netgear software
.

Weâll continue from there based on your findings.

it wants to access network files 

ChatGPT said:

Which specific app or process is requesting access to network files?

macOS prompting for access to "network files" usually means the software is trying to reach a shared drive, external storage, cloud resource, or another device on the local network. This can indicate:

Legitimate network activity (cloud synchronization, backups).

Malicious attempts to exfiltrate data or connect to attacker-controlled resources.

Immediate Next Steps:

1. Check the exact process requesting access:

When the pop-up appears, click 
Details
 or 
Allow/Deny
 to identify the app or service.

Screenshot the permission request for reference.

2. Immediately identify open network connections:

Run this in Terminal to see active network connections:

bash

Copy
