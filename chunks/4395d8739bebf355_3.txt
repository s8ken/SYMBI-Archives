Edit

lsof -i -P | grep -i 

"ESTABLISHED"

3. Check recent logs (system-wide) for unusual network activity:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "network"'

 --last 1h

4. Determine if the requesting app has associated LaunchAgents or Daemons:

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

grep -ir 

"<AppName>"

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons

Replace 
<AppName>
 with the suspicious process/app name.

Share the outputs from these steps here, particularly the exact details from the pop-up notification, and we'll determine whether it's malicious or benign.

You said:

there were 2 network drives they were accessing

2/2

ChatGPT said:

This strongly indicates unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration, especially given your prior suspicions.

Let's carefully confirm exactly what these network drives are, what files they were accessing, and block any ongoing activity.

Step 1: Identify the Mounted Network Drives

In Terminal, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount | grep 

"//"

and

bash

Copy

Edit

df

 -h | grep 

"//"

This will identify currently mounted remote volumes or network shares clearly.

Step 2: List Files Recently Accessed from Network Drives

If you have paths to those drives (e.g., 
/Volumes/NetworkDrive
), run:

bash

Copy

Edit

find /Volumes/<NetworkDriveName> -

type

 f -atime -7 -

exec

ls

 -ltu {} \; | 

head

 -20

Replace 
<NetworkDriveName>
 with actual names identified above. This shows files accessed within the last 7 days.

Step 3: Check Active Connections to Network Resources

Run the following to see live SMB or AFP connections:

bash

Copy

Edit

smbutil statshares -a

and also run:

bash

Copy

Edit

lsof -nPi TCP | grep -i smb
lsof -nPi TCP | grep -i afp

Step 4: Immediately Unmount Unauthorized Network Drives

To disconnect suspicious drives (once identified), run:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil unmount force /Volumes/<SuspiciousDrive>

Replace 
<SuspiciousDrive>
 with the drive name/path found earlier.

Step 5: Check Recent Logins and Access Attempts

Quickly review recent network login attempts:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "smb"'

 --last 7d

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "afp"'

 --last 7d

Provide any relevant outputs from these steps. We'll use them to definitively confirm unauthorized access and take precise action to remove the attacker's connection.

You said:

says it wants access to to folders in my desktop

ChatGPT said:

That's a significant security red flag.

Why this matters:

Requesting permission to access folders on your desktop strongly suggests attempts to read personal documents, files, or sensitive information.

Legitimate software typically doesn't request broad desktop access without clear, user-initiated reasons.

Immediate Actions (Do these now):

â 
Step 1: Check Exactly Which App/Process is Requesting Desktop Access

When the request pops up, carefully note or screenshot:

The exact 
name of the application or process
 requesting access.

Any other details provided in the prompt.

â 
Step 2: Identify the Process Actively Requesting Desktop Access

Run this in Terminal immediately after seeing the request:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem contains "TCC" AND eventMessage contains[c] "Desktop"'

 --last 30m | grep -i 

"access"

This will explicitly reveal recent requests by apps to access Desktop (TCC handles permissions).

â 
Step 3: Check Permissions You've Already Granted

Run to check existing permissions:

bash

Copy

Edit

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

This will reveal apps already given access to critical locations like Desktop or Documents.

â 
Step 3: Immediately Deny Access If Uncertain

If you donât clearly recognize the app, 
deny the request
 immediately to limit further exposure.

â 
Step 4: Investigate Active Connections and Files Opened on Desktop

Check active fil
