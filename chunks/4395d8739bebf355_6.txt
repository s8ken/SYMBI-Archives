These findings indicate 
active Remote Management and Screen Sharing components
 running on your Mac, along with 
frequent permission prompts
, strongly suggesting that your Mac is currently under a 
remote management profile or remote monitoring scenario
.

ð¨ 
Critical Observations:

Multiple Remote Management processes
:

RemoteManagementAgent

ScreenSharingSubscriber

DiskManagementSubscriber

SecuritySubscriber

and others under 
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/RemoteManagement.framework/

This usually occurs when 
Remote Management or MDM (Mobile Device Management)
 is enabled on your Mac. If you did 
not knowingly authorize or enroll
 your Mac into a remote-management system or MDM (like Jamf, Mosyle, or Apple's own Remote Management), this strongly suggests an attacker has silently enrolled your device into a remote management profile or MDM.

â 
Immediate Actions (High Priority):

1. Verify Remote Management Profiles (Critical)

Check if an MDM or profiles are configured on your Mac:

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

profiles status -

type

 enrollment

and also run:

bash

Copy

Edit

profiles list

If there are any profiles listed that you did not install or authorize, this strongly indicates compromise.

2. Check Screen Sharing and Remote Management Status:

In Terminal, verify:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i screensharing
sudo launchctl list | grep -i remotemanagement

And check:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist

3. Immediate Isolation Steps (If unauthorized profiles found):

Disable remote management immediately
 by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -stop

Also disable Screen Sharing (as an extra precaution):

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing

3. Check Permissions granted by macOS Privacy (TCC Database):

bash

Copy

Edit

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

 | grep Desktop

This explicitly identifies apps that have gained or requested desktop folder permissions.

4. Review Network Activity Quickly:

Check active connections in real-time:

bash

Copy

Edit

lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

Look closely at unfamiliar external IP addresses or suspicious ports.

Immediate Recommended Actions:

Deny any new pop-ups
 asking for folder access unless you explicitly recognize and trust them.

Run and share results
 from the commands above, specifically the 
profile checks
 and active network connection listings.

This will help determine whether unauthorized remote management is active and if attackers maintain ongoing control. Once you share those outputs, we'll determine the next crucial steps to secure your Mac and stop unauthorized access.
