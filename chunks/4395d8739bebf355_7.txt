These terms actually refer to themes for 
Oh My Zsh
, a popular framework for managing Zsh configurations. These themes change how your terminal looks and function as visual customizations. While these are legitimate and commonly used by developers, an attacker might use them to disguise malicious activity or make the terminal look familiar if they frequently use these tools.

Here's what they mean:

Basic
: A simple, minimalistic theme.

Grass
: A theme with a green color scheme.

Manpage
: Mimics the style of a Unix manual page.

Novel
: A theme that may have unique, customized prompts.

Ocean
: A theme with blue tones.

Pro
: A professional, clean look.

Red Sands
: A theme with red highlights.

Silver Aero
: A theme with a silver-toned prompt.

Gel
: A theme with a glossy, gel-like look.

Solid Colors
: A theme using distinct solid colors.

How an attacker might use these:

Distraction
: To keep the user from noticing suspicious terminal activity.

Familiarity
: To create a familiar environment for the attacker if they access the terminal.

Customization
: To configure the environment for automated scripts or hide malicious commands.

Letâs continue and investigate what they were up to on your system.
