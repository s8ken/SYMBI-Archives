User: Today, we need a high-level summary. Focus on:

Who they are

Where they are from

What they were trying to do

What they accessed

What they left behind

If they are still here

Any identifiers

Assistant: Understood. Letâs collect the final evidence quickly and summarize our findings.

Final Steps:

Check Active Network Connections for Attacker IPs

lsof

 ESTABLISHED

Check MDM Logs for Attacker Activity

log show 
--predicate

'eventMessage contains "MDM"'

Security Investigation

Sure! Here is a transcript of our text conversation so far:

User: So Homebrew and a whole bunch of other things got installed without my knowledge. We need to see what they were up to.

Assistant: Let's methodically investigate what was installed and identify their purpose.

Step 1: Check Installed Homebrew Packages and Dependencies

Open Terminal and run:

brew list

To see packages along with install dates:

ls

-lt
 /opt/homebrew/Cellar

or if Intel-based Mac:

ls

-lt
 /usr/local/Cellar

This command will list installed Homebrew packages, sorted by recent installations.

Step 2: Review Homebrew Installation Logs for Activity History

Check Homebrew's logs:

cat
 ~/Library/Logs/Homebrew/*.log

Step 3: Review Shell History for Suspicious Commands

history | 
grep
 brew

history | 
grep

curl

history | 
grep

git

Step 4: Verify Homebrew Configuration and Custom Taps

brew tap

Step 5: Check for Suspicious Services Managed by Homebrew

brew services list

Step 6: Check Cron Jobs or Launch Agents for Persistence

crontab 
-l

ls
 ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ls
 /Library/LaunchAgents

ls
 /Library/LaunchDaemons

Step 7: Scan for Recently Modified or Created Files in System Directories

find
 /usr/local/bin /opt/homebrew/bin 
-mtime

-30

-exec

ls

-ld
 {} \;

User ran commands and found:

Homebrew does not seem to be currently installed.

No log files exist for Homebrew.

History showed attempts to use 

brew

, but the tool was missing.

Found suspicious LaunchAgents including:

com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist

com.netgear.agent.plist

us.zoom.ZoomDaemon.plist

com.bitgapp.eqmac.helper.plist

com.cleverfiles.cfbackd.plist

com.objective-see.blockblock.plist

com.objective-see.ransomwhere.plist

Assistant: These LaunchAgents could indicate persistent processes. We need to analyze their contents.

Next Steps:

Check for Homebrew remnants

find
 / 
-name

"*homebrew*"

2
>/dev/null

Inspect suspicious plist files

cat
 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist

cat
 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist

Investigate AirPlay activity

log show 
--predicate

'process CONTAINS[c] "AirPlay"'

--last
 7d

User: There were 2 network drives they were accessing.

Assistant: Let's find out what they were accessing and whether the attacker is still here.

Step 1: Identify Mounted Network Drives

mount | 
grep

"//"

df 
-h
 | 
grep

"//"

Step 2: List Recently Accessed Files

find
 /Volumes/<NetworkDriveName> 
-type
 f 
-atime

-7

-exec

ls

-ltu
 {} \; | head 
-20

Step 3: Check Active Network Conn
