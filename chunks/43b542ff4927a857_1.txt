Got it =E2=80=94 looks like you were trying to b=
uild 
OpenAI=E2=80=99s 
go-vncdriver

 manually, but ran=
 into a few setup and syntax issues. Here=E2=80=99s a clear, corrected walk=
through to get it working properly on macOS (Apple Silicon / ARM64 Sequoia)=
.

=F0=9F=A7=A9 What Went Wrong

1. 
Using 
$
 in com=
mands

You copied shell commands directly i=
ncluding 
$
.

In the shell, 
$
 is a 
prompt symbol
, not part of the comm=
and =E2=80=94 so 
zsh
 threw=

command not found
 errors.=

2. 
Missing Python dependencies

The error:

v=
bnet

Copy code

=

ModuleNotFoundError:

 =
No 

module

 nam=
ed 

'numpy'

means you need to install dependenci=
es (like 
numpy
) before bui=
lding.

3. 

pip install -e
=
 usage

You ran 
pip install -e
 without specifying the directory =E2=80=
=94 it must point to the package folder (usually 
.
).

=E2=9C=85 Correct Installation Step=
s

Follow these exactly (no 
$
 prefix):

=
bash

Copy code

# 1. Clone the repo (alrea=
dy done)

git 

clone

 ht=
tps://github.com/openai/go-vncdriver.git

# 2. Move into the repo

cd

 go-vncdri=
ver

# 3. Create and activate a virtua=
l environment (recommended)

python3 -m venv venv

source

 venv/=
bin/activate

# 4. Install build dependencies

pip install numpy cython gym=3D=3D0.19.0

# 5. Build the C++/Go extension

python build.py

# 6. Install the package in edita=
ble mode

pip install -e .

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Notes for macOS ARM =
(M1/M2/M3/Sequoia)

Make sure you=E2=80=99ve installed=

Go
 via Homebrew (yo=
u did: =E2=9C=85).

You might need 
Xcode Command Line Tools
 if not alread=
y installed:

bash

Copy code

xcode-select --install

If you hit errors like 
fatal error: 'GL/gl.h' file not found
, install OpenGL headers:

bash

Copy code

brew install glfw
brew install pkg-config

Then retry:

bash

Copy code

python build.py

=F0=9F=A7=AA Test Installation

Once installed:

bash

Copy code

python -c 

"im=
port go_vncdriver; print('Success!')"

If it prints =E2=80=9CSuccess!=E2=
=80=9D without errors, you=E2=80=99re done =F0=9F=8E=89

Would you like me to help you 
patch 
go-vncdriver=

 for M1/M2 compatibility? (The upstream repo hasn=E2=80=99t=
 been updated for Apple Silicon, so I can show how to tweak its 
build.py
 and 
setup.py
 to build cleanly on macOS ARM.)

You're already 
inside
 the 
go-vncdriver
 directory =E2=80=94 that=E2=80=99s why 
cd go-vncdriver
 says =E2=80=9Cno such file or directory.=
=E2=80=9D You can confirm your current path with:

b=
ash

Copy code

pwd

You should see something like:

b=
ash

Copy code

=

/Users/admin/go-vncdriver

If you see that, you're in the corre=
ct place. There=E2=80=99s 
no ne=
ed
 to 
cd
 deeper.

Next Steps

Since you=E2=80=99re in the repo roo=
t, just proceed with the dependency installs and build steps:

b=
ash

Copy code

# Ensure you have a virtua=
l environment (optional but recommended)

python3 -m venv venv

source

 venv/=
bin/activate

# Install required Python package=
s

pip install numpy cython gym=3D=3D0.19.0

# Build the Go extension

python build.py

# Then install the package in edi=
table mode

pip install -e .

If you still get errors, please shar=
e:

The output of 
pwd

The output of 
ls
 (so we can confirm the structure of your curr=
ent directory)

And the error message (if any) from =

python build.py

Then I=E2=80=99ll pinpoint the fix precisely =E2=80=94 especiall=
y if it=E2=80=99s an ARM64 build issue on Sequoia.
