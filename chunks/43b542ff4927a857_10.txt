Nice=E2=80=94pointing me at that branch helps. I can=E2=80=99t=
 open the repo page directly right now due to a fetch error on my side (lik=

Dependabot bump of the 
openai
 npm package to 
5.23.1

. Here=E2=80=99s what that version change=
 implies and what I=E2=80=99d check against your trust stack.

Likely impact on SYMBI-SYNERGY

Given your stack (Bun + Elysia + Eli=
zaOS + OpenAI + local agent):

Runtime/API surface

If you=E2=80=99re using 
Realtime
 classes, the =E2=80=9Cbe=
ta=E2=80=9D header removal shouldn=E2=80=99t break code, but 
type guards and any beta-only toggles
 in your code may become dead paths. Quick scan/grep: 
Realtime | beta | headers
.

No API signature changes are noted=
 in 5.23.1 notes; it=E2=80=99s a 
safe patch
 on top of 5.23.0. 

Yarn

Types & build

The tsconfig chore (removing 
compilerOptions.baseUrl
) is i=
nternal to the SDK, but if you mirrored that setting anywhere, ensure your =

imports remain absolute/relat=
ive as intended
. 

Yarn

Bun/Elysia compatibility

The 
openai
 package is ESM-first and runs fine under Bun; j=
ust confirm your imports are 
=

import OpenAI from "openai"

 (no 
require
=
). The jsDelivr listing confirms the package versions and structure.

A package bump won=E2=80=99t chang=
e your 
capability boundaries
 by itself, but if you rely on 
Realtime
 agents for tool calls, re-validate:

Signed receipts / provenance
 still generated for those=
 tool invocations.

Policy checks
 (rate limits / budget) trigger before an=

Audit events
