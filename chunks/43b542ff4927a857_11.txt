Full Analysis of the Repository
This repo hosts SYMBI-SYNERGY, an enterprise-grade AI trust platform develo=
ped by a solo founder (s8ken) with no prior development experience, complet=
ed in just 7 months. The project focuses on solving "black box" issues in e=
nterprise AI adoption, such as regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act risks=
 with fines up to =E2=82=AC35M), bias detection, liability tracking, and au=
ditability. It achieves this through cryptographic proofs for every AI deci=
sion, real-time dashboards, and support for multiple AI providers like Open=
AI, Anthropic, and Perplexity. The platform positions itself in a $62B tota=
l addressable market (TAM) for AI trust and compliance, with a 47% CAGR dri=
ven by 2025 regulations, targeting $150K+ ARR per customer and a potential =
18-month moat via a patent filing in Australia.
Key Technical Highlights

Architecture: Backend uses Node.js/Express with JWT/RBAC authentication, So=
cket.IO for real-time updates, and MongoDB for data storage. Frontend is bu=
ilt with React and Material-UI, featuring a compliance dashboard for metric=
s like trust scores and board reports. It includes zero-trust security, rat=
e limiting, input sanitization, and CORS handling. Full architecture detail=
s are in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
