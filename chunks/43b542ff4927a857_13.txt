Takeaway:
 Your gateway-level enforcement is strong tod=

capability-scoped tokens
 (short-lived, least-privilege =
grants per tool) and a declarative policy layer.

DRUID:

 DRUID wins on out-of-the-box enterprise conn=

Takeaway:
 DRUID has a strong product story for non-tec=

manifest-driven agent builder
 UI that bakes in tru=

Concrete improvements that would =
widen your lead

Capability-scoped tokens

Short-lived, signed tokens that encode 
{tool, scope, budget, TTL}
 and are verified in Elysia/Expr=
ess middleware 
before
 tool execution. This enforces least privilege beyond RBAC. (Extends what =
you already do with JWT/rate-limits.) 

README

Signed execution receipts as first-class artifacts

You already sign interactions; ensure 
SDK version, model, tool IDs, input/output hashes, policy decisio=
n
 are always included for partner verification. (You have receipts=
 + hash-chain; push more metadata.)

ARCHITECTURE

Declarative policy layer

Ship a simple YAML/JSON policy (limits, allowed tools/models, network egres=
s) with hot-reload. Keep orchestration 
policy-driven
 rather than code-driven. (You already enfo=
rce at gateway.)
