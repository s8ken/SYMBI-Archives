Why Agentverse helps here

Hosted Agents
: fast spin-up, no servers to maintain, 
Agent Storage
 for sta=

Platform to enable the agentic=
 economy.

Allowed imports + full Python
: you=E2=80=99re not boxe=

Step-by-step rollout

A) Stand up one Hosted Site Agent=
 (template you=E2=80=99ll clone 3=C3=97)

Create Hosted Agent
 in Agentverse (start from blank sc=
ript). You=E2=80=99ll get an 
ag=
ent.py
 and the code editor with tabs for 
Secrets / Storage / Logs
. 

Platfo=
rm to enable the agentic economy.

Storage schema
:

session:{id}
 (short conversation state)

rag:last_crawl_ts
 (health)

trust:last_receipt_id

Tools in agent code
:

rag.retrieve(index=3D"<site>", top_k=3D6)
 (points to=
 your vector DB)

web.fetch
 with a 
domain allow-list
 (ycq/* etc.)

answer_with_citations
 (include URLs + passage IDs)

Trust hook
: after composing the answer, compute 
input_hash
/
output_hash
, add metadata, 
sign
, and store receipt ID in Storag=
e.

(Optional) 
Register Web3 Name / domain
 for the agent s=
o it=E2=80=99s easy to call. 

Platform to enable the agentic=
 economy.

Note: Hosted agents 
reset globals
 per call; rely on 
Agent Storage
 for any =
persistent state.

B) Clone for the other two sites

Duplicate the Hosted Agent; change=
 the 
index name
 &=
; domain allow-list.

C) Deploy Repo Agents (Local + Ma=
ilbox/Proxy)

Run each repo agent on your infra =
(Node/Bun/Python=E2=80=94your choice).

Connect to Agentverse via 
Mailbox
 (buffers messages wh=
ile offline). Use Agentverse 
=
Local Agent Inspector
 to bind mailbox; messages queue and deliver =
later.

If you want real-time marketplace =
visibility and you=E2=80=99re always-on, wire a 
Proxy
 instead (no buffering; offline messages a=
