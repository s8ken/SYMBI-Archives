4) Guardrails the agents should f=
ollow (maps your =E2=80=9CBoundary Enforcement=E2=80=9D)

Web allow-list
 per site (e.g., 
ycq.example
, 
symbi.world
)

Model allow-list:

["gpt-4o-mini","claude-3.7-sonnet"]

Budgets:

m=
ax_input_tokens=3D8000
, 
=
max_output_tokens=3D1500
, 
cost_ceiling_usd=3D1.00

Repo actions:
 read/analysis OK; 
writes gated
 (no push, comment only via ap=
proved intent)

Receipts required:
 every tool call and final answer

5) =E2=80=9CColleague Effect=E2=
=80=9D =E2=86=92 operationalization (how it shows up in outputs)

When an agent replies, it should i=
nclude 4 quick panels:

Continuity
 =E2=80=94 what I remember from prior steps

Role focus
 =E2=80=94 what I=E2=80=99m prioritizing now=
 and why

Boundaries
 =E2=80=94 what I will/won=E2=80=99t do this=
 step (with policy refs)

Value assessment
 =E2=80=94 why this step increases tru=
st/velocity

(This turns the philosophy into a repeatable output template.)

6) Definition of Done for Phase 1=
, Step 1

/partners
 renders from 
SYMBI Vault
 entries (schema above)

At least 
one live receipt
 displayed (or link to a rece=
ipt verifier)

Agent replies conform to 
intent JSON
 + 
receipt stub

Web & model 
allow-lists enforced

CI check to reject PRs that add pa=
rtners without a receipt id

If you want, I can now generate:

the 
partners React component
 (clean, responsive), or

the 
/api/exec
 endpoint that verifies HMAC and emits 
Ed25519 receipts
.

Tell me which artifact you want fi=
rst, and I=E2=80=99ll drop it in ready to paste.

we can use Gamma Tria in greek alphabet for the inverted Y?

Thought =

Short answer: yes=E2=80=94but if you literally=
 want an 
=E2=80=9Cinverted Y=E2=
=80=9D
 glyph, the Greek letter you=E2=80=99re picturing is 
Lambda (=CE=9B)
, not Gamma. H=
ere=E2=80=99s how to express 
Gamma =
Tria
 while keeping that look:

Which Greek letter looks like an in=
verted Y?

=CE=9B (Lambda)
 =E2=86=92 looks like an inverted 
V/Y
. Great if the shape is the=
 priority.

=CE=A5 (Upsilon)
 =E2=86=92 looks like a Latin 
Y
 (not inverted).

=CE=93 (Gamma)
 =E2=86=92 
=CE=93
 is a right-angle; 
=CE=B3
 (lowercase) can look 
y-ish
 in some fonts but not an inverted Y.

=CE=A8 (Psi)
 =E2=86=92 trident-Y vibe; visually suggests =
=E2=80=9Cthree=E2=80=9D (three prongs).

Good mark directions (pick one)

=CE=93=C2=B3
 =E2=80=94 
Gamma Tria =3D =E2=80=9CGamma to the third=E2=80=9D

Clean, literal, and mathematically n=
eat. Works well as a logomark and in text.

=CE=9B=C2=B3
 =E2=80=94 if you want the 
inverted-Y
 silhouette but still encode =
=E2=80=9Cthree.=E2=80=9D

Honest note: this is 
Lambda
, not Gamma=E2=80=94but the vis=
ual likely matches your intent.

=CE=A8
 =E2=80=94 the prongs suggest 
three
, so it=E2=80=99s an elegant single-gl=
yph for =E2=80=9CTria.=E2=80=9D

You can pair 
=CE=A8
 with the wordmark =E2=80=9CGAMMA T=
RIA=E2=80=9D (Latin) or =E2=80=9C=CE=93=CE=AC=CE=
