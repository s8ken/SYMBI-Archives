Thought for 5s

nice! that w=
orks. a few tiny tweaks will make it crisper across browsers and at small s=
izes:

quick refinements

make the 
=C2=B3
 a real superscript using a 
<tspan>
 with baseline shift (more r=
eliable than separate 
<text>=
;
).

add an explicit 
fill
 (so it doesn=E2=80=99t inherit odd =
CSS).

include 

role=3D"img"
 + 
<title>

 for accessibility.

nudge baselines/spacing for optical =
balance (the =CE=9B sits a bit low vs the wordmark).

unify font fallbacks.

polished mono version

gradient accent version

notes

if the superscript sits too high/l=
ow in your browser, tweak the 
&=
lt;tspan dy=3D"-50">
 (try 
-46
 to 
-54
 r=
ange).

for dark backgrounds, change both =

fill=3D"#0B0B10"
 to 
#FFFFFF
.

if you prefer a single-glyph monog=
ram for favicons, keep the 
=
=CE=9B=C2=B3
 only (no wordmark) and set 
viewBox=3D"0 0 120 120"
.

want me to generate PNG exports (l=
ight/dark @1x, @2x, @3x) or a tiny React component that swaps mono/gradient=
 based on theme?
