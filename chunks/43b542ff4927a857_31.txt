=F0=9F=94=90 Security Posture
Before (Original Review):
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Security: 7/10
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Default JWT secrets
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Math.random() for API keys
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F No signature verification
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F No DID resolution
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F No revocation
Now (After 14-Day Sprint):
=E2=9C=85 Security: 8.5/10 (pending final hardening)
=E2=9C=85 Crypto-secure random (crypto.randomBytes)
=E2=9C=85 Ed25519, secp256k1, RSA verification
=E2=9C=85 4 DID method drivers
=E2=9C=85 Status List 2021 revocation
=E2=9C=85 KMS integration (AWS, GCP)
