5) Pilot scripts (polished)

Enroll

bash

Copy code

npm run pilot:enroll -- --partner 

"Acme Corp"

 --did did:web:acme.com=
 --kms gcp:prod

Issue VC

bash

Copy code

npm run pilot:issue -- --agent-id 

"agent-123"

 --

type

 TrustScore --score 0.92

Verify

bash

Copy code

npm run pilot:verify -- --vc-id 

"vc-456"

 --policy strict

Each script should print:

=E2=9C=85/=E2=9D=8C, receipt 
id
 + 
signature
 (first 16 chars), 
chainPrev
 (first 16), and a verifier URL.

6) Demo choreography (10=E2=80=93=
12 min)

Dashboard
: show live trust events; filter by DID metho=
d; open a receipt =E2=86=92 verify chain link.

Issue & revoke
: issue a TrustScore VC =E2=86=92 ve=
rify; then revoke =E2=86=92 verify fails (StatusList flips).

Anomaly
: simulate burst =E2=86=92 see RL headers + ano=
maly flag + quarantine.

Security
: show that prod won=E2=80=99t boot without KM=
S; rotate key (
kid
 chang=
e reflected in new receipts).

7) Investor one-pager bullets (yo=
u=E2=80=99re ready)

=E2=80=9CSSL for AI=E2=80=9D
: receipts, DID/VC, revoca=
tion, KMS.

Moat
: crypto-verifiable audit + network effects (porta=
ble trust scores).

Compliance now
: EU AI Act, SOC 2 hooks; revocation + s=
tatus lists in place.

Proof
: 8k LOC, 120+ tests, 4 DID methods, dashboards, =
pilots scripts.

Pricing
: TaaS, CaaS, enterprise license; attach real u=
nit costs.

What I can deliver right now

A ready-to-drop 

ope=
napi.yml

 (v0.9 freeze) with the receipt endpoints + example=
s.

A small 
Red-Team harness
 (
npm run redteam
) that executes the four attacks and =
prints a pass/fail table.

A 
JWT/JTI middleware
 module (Express) with Redis adapt=
er + tests.
