Would you like me to generate a quick

 that edits 
build.py
 for you (no manual editin=
g required)? It would add the

opt/homebrew
 paths automatically so you can just paste it into your =
terminal.

can you do it with agent mode?

It looks like the =
missing step now is modifying the 
b=
uild.py
 script so it recognizes the Homebrew paths for 
jpeg=E2=80=91turbo
 on Apple Silicon. I =
can generate a short patching script for you that:

Inserts the correct 
/opt/homebrew/opt/jpeg-turbo/{include,lib}
=
 paths into 
build.py
.

Exports all required environment var=
iables.

Rebuilds 
go-vncdriver
.

Would you like me to create that shell script for you (and give y=
ou the file to download and run), or would you prefer step-by-step instruct=
ions that you can paste into your terminal?

I=
've generated a ready-to-run build script for your Apple Silicon (M1/M2) in=
stallation of 
go=E2=80=91vncdriv=
er
. Download the script here:  
build_m1_patch.sh
 and place it in the r=
oot of your 
go=E2=80=91vncdriver
 repository.

Running the script

Open a terminal and navigate to the =

go=E2=80=91vncdriver
 root =
directory (the folder containing 
=
build.py
).

Make the script executable:

b=
ash

Copy code

chmod

=
 +x build_m1_patch.sh

Execute the script:

b=
ash

Copy code

./build_m1_patch.sh

This will automatically:

Insert the correct 
/opt/homebrew/opt/jpeg-turbo
 library and i=
nclude paths into 
build.py
=
.

Export the necessary environment var=
iables (
GOARCH
, 
CGO_ENABLED
, 
LDFLAGS
, etc.) for an M1 build.

Run 
build.py
 and install the package in editable mode via 
pip
.

Once finished, you should be able to 
import go_vncdriver
 without errors. Let me know if you=
 need any further help!
