Would you like me to show what that comparison would look like (s=

I tried to find the GitHub repository

gy

 (or =E2=80=9Csymbi-synergy=E2=80=9D) on public search en=
gines, but I couldn=E2=80=99t locate it. There=E2=80=99s no obvious matchin=
g project or documentation that describes its =E2=80=9Ctrust infrastructure=
=E2=80=9D publicly.

So I can=E2=80=99t directly compare =
DRUID=E2=80=99s architecture with yours (yet).

What I 
can
 do is:

Propose a 
comparison framework
 (key axes) for comparing AI=
 platform architectures (DRUID) vs a trust/agent orchestration infrastructu=
re (like yours).

Ask some targeted questions so I can=
 better map your design.

Once you connect or give access to y=
our repository, I can run an in-depth analysis and side-by-side comparison.=

If you like, you can:

Share a 
link or private access
 to your 
s8ken/symbi-synergy
 repository.

Provide any architecture docs, REA=
DME sections, or diagrams you have.

Tell me which parts of DRUID=E2=80=
=99s architecture impressed you most (e.g. their autonomy, plug-in model, e=
tc.).

Once I have that, I can do a full =
architecture-level comparison between DRUID AI and 
your trust/agent infrastructure
.

Do you want me to formally request=
 access or help you upload the relevant parts (architecture docs) so I can =
start comparing?
