Or describe the major components (au=

Then I can do a detailed comparison =

 outlined earlier. Which option do you want to go with?

Would you like to:

Confirm the exact URL (maybe casing =

Share the README or architecture doc=

Or make that repo visible so I can d=

Once I can view your code/architectu=
