Questions to close the gap:
 Do you support 
dynamic agent spawning
 and 
context-aware routing
 (s=
kills registry), or is routing static via endpoints? Any 
capability registry
 / 
agent directory
?

2) Identity & trust (the crux=

DRUID:
 Publicly emphasizes role-based access, encrypti=
on, and auditability=E2=80=94especially in regulated verticals (e.g., AML/K=
YC language on banking page). They don=E2=80=99t expose a low-level crypto =
spec publicly.

SYMBI-SYNERGY (goal):
 You=E2=80=99ve called it a 
trust infrastructure
. If =
you=E2=80=99re using signed events (JWT/JWS), per-agent keys, or DIDs/VCs f=
or provenance, that=E2=80=99s a strong differentiator vs. =E2=80=9CRBAC-onl=
y=E2=80=9D.

What would differentiate you:

Provenance:
 signed chain-of-thought 
metadata
 (not content) + tamper-evident execut=
ion trails.

Capability tokens:
 least-privilege, time-boxed, scope-=
bound tool grants.

Cross-agent trust:
 attestations for tool invocations, =
with remote verification.

Human-in-the-loop policy:
 override/approval flows embe=
dded in the trust layer (not just the UI).

SYMBI-SYNERGY:
 If you support 
declarative agent manifests
 (capabilities, t=
ools, datasets, policies) with codegen into Elysia/ElizaOS plugins, that ma=
tches or beats their builder=E2=80=94especially if manifests also specify 
trust constraints
.

Where SYMBI-SYNERGY can clearly o=
utshine (recommendations)

Cryptographic trust & provenance:

Add/confirm per-agent keypairs, signed execution receipts, and optional 
DID/VC
 issuance for int=
er-org interoperability. Expose a simple 
verify()
 CLI/endpoint for partners.

Capability-scoped tokens:

Replace broad API keys with signed, short-lived, 
least-privilege
 tokens (tool+scope+budget+TTL)=
. Enforce at the Elysia middleware.

Policy-driven orchestration:

Keep routing declarative: 
inten=
t =E2=86=92 policy =E2=86=92 agent selection =E2=86=92 allowed tools
=
. Policy changes shouldn=E2=80=99t require redeploys.

Structured audit stream:

Emit JSON events (task_id, actor, intent, policy_decision, inputs_hash, out=
puts_hash, sigs). Provide a 
p=
rivacy-preserving
 mode (hash/redact sensitive fields) with 
verifiable
 metadata.

Agent manifests & builder:

YAML/JSON manifests that define tools, data scopes, trust constraints, quot=
as=E2=80=94plus a small UI to assemble/validate them. This meets DRUID=E2=
=80=99s =E2=80=9Cagent builder=E2=80=9D story, but with 
trust baked in
.
