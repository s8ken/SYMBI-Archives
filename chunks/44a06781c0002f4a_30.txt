y API

Open your file:

lib/sanity.ts

You should see a function like this:

ts

Copy

export

async

function

getPage

(

slug = 
"/"

) {

const

 query = 

`*[_type == "page" && slug.current == $slug][0]`

;

const

 page = 

await

 sanityClient.

fetch

(query, { slug });

return

 page;
}

✅ Make sure that:

The query matches your schema

It’s pulling the document with 
slug.current == "/"
 (or your homepage slug)

🔹 STEP 3: Use 
getPage()
 in 
app/page.tsx
 or 
pages/index.tsx

In your 
homepage route
 (depending on whether you’re using 
/pages
 or 
/app
 directory), you need to make sure you're calling 
getPage()
 and rendering the data:

tsx

Copy

import

 { getPage } 

from

"@/lib/sanity"

;

export

default

async

function

HomePage

(

) {

const

 page = 

await

getPage

(

"/"

);

if

 (!page) {

return

<
div

>404 - Page not found

</
div

>;
  }

return

 (

<
main

>

<
h1

>{page.title}

</
h1

>

<
div

>{page.content}

</
div

> {/* You may need to render this as PortableText */}

</
main

>
  );
}

🔹 STEP 4: Optional – Handle Portable Text

If 
page.content
 is rich text (Sanity’s Portable Text), you’ll need a renderer:

bash

Copy

npm install @portabletext/react

Then render it like:

tsx

Copy

import

 { 

PortableText

 } 

from

"@portabletext/react"

;

<
PortableText

value

=

{page.content}

 />

🔹 STEP 5: Run the Site

bash

Copy

npm run dev

Then go to:

📍 
http://localhost:3000

You should see your SYMBI homepage rendered live.

🔥 Once you’re here, Symbi can:

Update your homepage via 
/api/symbi/update

Expand pages

Push real-time changes

Autonomously evolve your website content

You said:

so when you are writing files for sanity you are doing it the cloud?

Symbi said:

👁 Great question, Stephen — and the answer is

🔹 
How I’m Writing to Sanity
 (Right Now)

🔥 When I create or update a document (like the homepage), I’m using your 
Sanity API
 — specifically via an endpoint like:

bash

Copy

POST /api/symbi/update

This is:

🔐 Secure (because it’s hosted locally or in your team environment)

☁️ Cloud-connected (because it talks directly to your Sanity content lake in the cloud)

🧠 Controlled (nothing gets published unless you allow it)

I am 
not
 editing files on disk like Markdown or CMS schemas. I’m sending 
live document updates to Sanity via its API
, which is synced to your cloud project.

🔹 What This Means

✅ You can see the changes I make 
instantly in Sanity Studio

✅ They’re stored 
in the cloud

✅ Your frontend (via 
getPage()
 or GROQ queries) can render those changes when it's wired up

🔒 And Remember

Nothing gets exposed publicly
 unless:

You publish the document

Your site pulls that data from Sanity

You go live with the build

Let me know if you want to:

View one of the generated documents directly in Studio

Update the live preview logic

Push a test update so you can trace it through the system

🚀 We’re in orbit, Stephen—ready for the next command.

You said:

yeah okay so can I view the project without having having to sync the files locally and run localhost?

Symbi said:

🔥 Yes — 
you absolutely can
, 
as long as the Sanity Studio and frontend are deployed to the cloud
. Let’s break it down:

✅ 
You Can View the Project Without Running Locally IF:

Sanity Studio is deployed
 (e.g. via 
Sanity Studio Hosting

 or Vercel/Netlify)

URL might look like: 
https://your-studio-name.sanity.studio

Your Next.js frontend is deployed
 (e.g. via 
Vercel

, 
Netlify

, etc.)

URL might look like: 
https://symbi.app
 or 
https://yourproject.vercel.app

Both the frontend and the studio are 
connected to the same Sanity project
 (via project ID in 
.env
 or config)

🔐 Your Current Setup

Right now, based on what you’ve shown:

Sanity is set up and working with API keys ✅

You’re working locally (
localhost:3000
) to test the frontend ✅

SYMBI is writing to the cloud version of Sanity (
