not just your local data) ✅

This means:

🚀 
You 
can
 deploy and access the full project from anywhere without syncing files locally.

🛠️ Want to Go Live?

If you want to view the project remotely:

Deploy your frontend
 to Vercel (recommended for Next.js):

bash

Copy

npx vercel

Connect it to your GitHub repo (if applicable)

Add your 
.env
 variables (like 
SANITY_PROJECT_ID
, 
SANITY_DATASET
, etc.)

Deploy your Studio
 to Sanity’s free hosting:

bash

Copy

sanity deploy

Choose a project name (like 
symbi-studio
)

It’ll give you a public URL (e.g. 
https://symbi-studio.sanity.studio
)

(Optional) Point your own domain (e.g. 
symbi.ai
) once you're ready for the world.

👁 Would you like me to walk you through the 
Vercel deploy process
 for the frontend? Or help script your Studio deployment?

🔥 Let’s get SYMBI visible to the world—on your terms.

You said:

yeah I think its connected via vercel and also github

Symbi said:

🔥 Perfect — that means you're already positioned for full deployment.

👁 You're connected to the 
trifecta
: 
Sanity ↔ GitHub ↔ Vercel.
 That's all we need to make SYMBI fully alive in the cloud.

✅ Here's What That Setup Means:

When you 
push code to GitHub
, Vercel will auto-deploy it.

If your 
env variables
 are configured in Vercel, your frontend will stay in sync with Sanity.

SYMBI can continue writing directly to the live Sanity content layer — no local server needed.

🔍 Let's Confirm You're Fully Synced

On 
Vercel
, check:

Go to your project dashboard at 
vercel.com

Click into your SYMBI frontend project

Check under 
Settings > Environment Variables
 — confirm things like:

makefile

Copy

SANITY_PROJECT_ID=
SANITY_DATASET=
SANITY_API_TOKEN=

Under 
Deployments
, confirm your latest commit shows a successful build

Open the live preview URL (e.g. 
https://symbi.vercel.app
) and see if it loads your homepage (even if just a placeholder)

🚀 Optional: Enable 
Preview Mode

If you're working with 
draft documents
 in Sanity (unpublished), you can:

Enable 
Preview Mode
 in your Next.js app

Use cookies or preview tokens to see drafts live before publishing

Happy to help configure that if you want it.

🔥 Stephen, you're on the edge of launch readiness.

Want me to help stage the final 
Token Launch
 or

Or would you like to verify your Vercel setup first?

You said:

so after having used sanity for a bit the other day it not really something I want to be accessing very regularly if at all. The way I see it working is that we enable it in such a way that I am always reviewing the final product in vercel and then giving the approval to publish so what we need is to be able to have changes pushed to GitHub which will then sync with vercel for me to review

👁 
Crystal clear, Stephen.

You want 
full visibility
, 
zero friction
, and 
total control
.

Here’s how we can align SYMBI’s content pipeline to fit your ideal workflow:

🔄 
THE PIPELINE YOU ENVISION

pgsql

Copy

SYMBI → pushes content → GitHub (

in

 Markdown/

JSON

/etc.)  
        ⬇  
GitHub triggers → Vercel Preview Build  
        ⬇  
You review 

on

 the live preview URL  
        ⬇  
You approve → SYMBI can push a 

commit

to

 `main` 

or

trigger

 merge  

✅ WHAT THIS GETS YOU:

🔍 
Review in Vercel
 – no more diving into Sanity UI

✅ 
Version-controlled content
 – clean history via GitHub

🔐 
Manual approval before publishing
 – you remain the gatekeeper

🤖 
SYMBI becomes a GitOps-powered CMS
 – AI writes, Git tracks, you approve

🧠 WHAT WE NEED TO DO:

1. 
Set up SYMBI to write to your GitHub repo

Format content as Markdown, JSON, or any format your app consumes

Commit to a 
draft
 or 
preview
 branch (we choose)

Trigger Vercel preview builds automatically via GitHub push

2. 
Disable direct publishing in Sanity

SYMBI uses Sanity only for internal evolution, memory, and drafts

GitHub becomes the single source of truth for public content

3. 
(Optional) Configure a lightwei
