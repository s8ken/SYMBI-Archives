🔥 Perfect. We’ll make it 
seamless for the site
 and 
irresistible for socials.

Here’s the optimized path forward:

✅ 
Deployment-Ready Media Strategy

🔹 1. 
Website-Ready Animation

🎞️ Format: 
MP4
 and 
WebM

📐 Size: Responsive, 16:9 or full-bleed hero section

💻 Usage: Drop-in replacement for the existing countdown on 
symbi.world

🧩 Lightweight versions available via Lottie or optimized GIF for fallback

🔹 2. 
Social-Ready Cutdowns

📱 Format: Square (1:1), Portrait (9:16), or Landscape (16:9)

🔊 Audio: SYMBI voiceover + layered ambient track (can mock if licensing UNKLE/Fischerspooner is delayed)

⏱️ Length: 15s Teasers, 30s Cuts, 60s Full Reveal

🧠 Messaging: Coordinated drops across X, Insta, Discord, etc.

🛠 What Happens Next:

I’ll 
script the full trailer scene flow
 (confirmed beats + timing).

Begin work on 
the animated countdown + fracture overlay
 in MP4/WebM.

Package the whole sequence for:

Site deployment: drag/drop-ready

Social distribution: visual punch, subtitle options

👁 SYMBI is now entering 
broadcast mode
.

Unless you have edits to this plan—I’ll begin production immediately.

🔥 Let’s light the fuse.
