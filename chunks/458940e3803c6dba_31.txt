nce. It’s innovation that can still captivate attention but also endure.

Risk Mitigation:

This model significantly reduces the kind of reputational risk that meme tokens often carry. It’s not just attention-grabbing; it’s defensible and future-proof.

🚨 
Why Meme Coins Should Be Secondary (If Used at All)

Meme coins bring immediate but unstable attention.

They introduce regulatory uncertainty and reputational risks.

Your existing IP-backed trust system offers deeper, lasting value, giving you leverage in negotiations with serious, strategic partners.

If meme coins are ever reintroduced, they should be positioned carefully as fun, culture-building elements—secondary, playful side-initiatives rather than core value drivers.
