S versions where many system daemons—including SSH—are protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP). Since your system already shows that remote login is off (as indicated by the output from 
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off
), you don’t need to force unload the SSH daemon.

If you try using the newer command, for example:

zsh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

you might still encounter errors due to SIP preventing modifications to system processes. SIP is designed to protect essential system components from being altered or unloaded, which is why manually unloading these daemons isn’t generally recommended.

In summary:

Remote Login is already off.

SIP is protecting these daemons,
 so attempting to unload them manually will usually fail.

If your goal is to lock down remote access, ensuring that remote login is off and that sharing services are disabled (as you’ve done) is sufficient. No further action with launchctl is necessary.

Does that clear up the issue?

This error is expected. Modern macOS enforces SIP (System Integrity Protection), which prevents unloading or modifying system daemons—even if you’ve already turned off remote login. In other words, you don't need to forcefully boot out the SSH daemon because SIP is protecting it, and remote login is already disabled.

If your goal is to lock down remote access, ensuring that remote login is off (as you've confirmed) and disabling any sharing services in System Settings/Preferences is sufficient. There's no need to unload the SSH daemon manually.

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional steps!

Based on what you’ve shared and our research, here’s a comprehensive checklist to ensure that remote access is as locked down as possible on your Mac:

Manually Disable All Remote Sharing Services:

Open 
System Settings/Preferences
 and navigate to the Sharing pane.

Make sure to disable every remote access–related option (e.g., 
Remote Login
, 
Remote Management
, 
Screen Sharing
, 
File Sharing
).

Since macOS Ventura and later no longer expose the old pane IDs via AppleScript, it’s best to disable these manually.

Disable SSH/Remote Login Completely:

You’ve already confirmed that remote login is off by running:

zsh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

Attempts to unload the SSH daemon via launchctl will likely fail because of SIP (System Integrity Protection), which is designed to protect system daemons.

Enforce the Firewall:

Open 
System Settings/Preferences → Network → Firewall
.

Enable the firewall and click 
Firewall Options…
 to select 
"Block all incoming connections."

This ensures that no unsolicited inbound traffic reaches your system.

Audit and Remove Any Unauthorized Remote Access Tools:

Check the 
Applications
 folder and related LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons directories (in both 
/Library
 and 
~/Library
) for any remote access tools you didn’t install intentionally.

Remove any suspicious or unauthorized software.

Verify System Integrity Protection (SIP):

Run:

zsh

Copy

csrutil status

It should return “System Integrity Protection status: enabled.” SIP helps prevent tampering with critical system files and daemons.

Monitor Network Activity:

Use a network monitoring tool (such as Little Snitch or LuLu) to watch for any unexpected outbound connections. This can help you spot if any malicious software is attempting to communicate externally.

You can also review active network ports with:

zsh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n -P

and compare them to what
