n suspicious applications.

Homebrew Packages:
 The error “command not found: brew” suggests Homebrew isn’t installed—which is expected on a fresh system if you haven’t reinstalled it.

Camera Access:
 The function for checking camera access executed and reset the camera access, which is a good remediation step.

There’s no additional output indicating unauthorized processes or configurations beyond what your audit script intended to check. However, if you’re still concerned, it might be wise to run further diagnostics (such as reviewing active processes, network connections, or any startup items) to double-check that nothing remains out of place.

Does that match what you were expecting, or would you like to run additional checks?

so I want to make sure SIP is running and that overall the file structure is was we would expect for a fresh install

To verify that SIP (System Integrity Protection) is active, open your Terminal and type:

zsh

Copy

csrutil status

You should see a message like:

System Integrity Protection status: enabled.

As for checking the file structure against a fresh install, there isn’t a single command that compares your entire filesystem automatically. Instead, you can manually inspect key system directories such as:

/System

/Library

/Applications

For example, run:

zsh

Copy

ls -la /System /Library /Applications

Review the output for any unexpected files or modifications. You might also consider using a file integrity tool (like Tripwire or Apple's own diagnostics) to monitor changes.

If everything looks normal (and SIP is enabled), it’s a good sign that your system is in the expected state after your fresh install.

Would you like any more details on running these checks or setting up an integrity audit?
