y Remove It

Since 
launchctl bootout
 also failed, 
adb
 might be 
installed incorrectly
 or 
persisting through another method
. Let's fully remove it.

1️⃣ Find Where 
adb
 Is Installed

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo find / -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

This will show 
all locations
 where 
adb
 exists. Let me know what it returns.

2️⃣ Manually Delete 
adb

If 
find
 shows paths like:

/usr/local/bin/adb

/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb

/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.android.adb.plist

Remove them with:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /path/to/adb

(Replace 
/path/to/adb
 with the actual path from 
find
.)

Then remove its launch agent:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.android.adb.plist

3️⃣ Restart & Confirm Removal

Restart your Mac

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep adb

If 
nothing appears
, 
adb
 is gone. ✅

If it 
comes back
, we need deeper cleanup.

Quick Question:
 Did You Install Any Android-Related Software?

If not, 
adb
 being installed is 
very suspicious
—it could be part of unauthorized remote access.

If yes, but you 
don’t need it
, we’ll still fully remove it.

Let me know what 
find
 returns! 🚀

You said:

its asking if terminal can access the HDD and then the photo library

ChatGPT said:

🚨 
That’s highly suspicious!
 Terminal should 
not
 need access to your HDD or Photos just to search for 
adb
.

This suggests 
one of two things
:

Your system has extra security (like macOS Privacy Protections),
 and it’s just asking for permission. ✅

A malicious process is intercepting Terminal requests
 to gain extra access. 🚨

🚀 Next Steps:

1️⃣ Deny the Request for Now

If you 
don’t recognize this behavior
, 
click "Deny"
 when macOS asks for access.

If it keeps asking, let me know.

2️⃣ Run a Limited 
find
 Instead

Since full disk access triggered the prompt, try searching specific safe locations:

bash

Copy

sudo find /usr /Library /System -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

If 
adb
 is installed somewhere suspicious, it should still appear.

3️⃣ Check If Anything Else Has Full Disk Access

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Full Disk Access

Look for any 
unexpected apps with access
 (especially anything unknown).

Let me know if you see anything unusual.

❓ Questions

Did Terminal ever ask for disk access before?

Do you recognize any suspicious apps in Full Disk Access?

Have you noticed any other odd permissions requests?

Let me know what you find! 🚀

You said:

can we double check what permissions it has granted before we go any further?

ChatGPT said:

Yes! Let’s 
double-check Terminal’s permissions
 before proceeding.

🚀 1️⃣ Check Terminal's Permissions in macOS Settings

Go to
:

System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Full Disk Access

Look for "Terminal"
 in the list.

If it’s enabled
, it means Terminal already has full access.

If it’s disabled
, macOS is asking because it needs extra access.

🔹 Question:
 Is Terminal already listed here? If yes, is it toggled 
on or off
?

🔍 2️⃣ Check Other Permissions (Camera, Microphone, etc.)

Since you mentioned 
unexpected permission prompts
, check:

System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 →

Files & Folders
 → Look for Terminal

Photos
 → Look for Terminal

Camera & Microphone
 → Look for anything unusual

Screen Recording
 → Ensure only trusted apps are listed

🔹 Question:
 Do you see anything strange, like apps you didn’t approve?

🛑 3️⃣ Check if Terminal Was Recently Granted Permissions

To see if Terminal (or any other app) was 
just granted access
, check system logs:

Run this command to check recent permissions granted:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.TCC"'

 --info --last 1h

This will list any 
permissions granted in the last hour
.

Look for Terminal, adb, or anything unexpected.

Next Steps Based on What You Find

If Terminal already has full disk access
 → We can proceed safely. ✅

If Terminal does NOT have access, but macOS keeps asking
 → Possible interference. 🚨
