apps with permissions
 → We might need to revoke them.

Let me know what you find! 🚀

yep terminal was there to I clicked the - button

Good call! 
Removing Terminal from Full Disk Access means it no longer has unrestricted access.
 Now, let's proceed carefully.

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ Retry Searching for 
adb
 (With Limited Scope)

Now that Terminal has 
no extra permissions
, let’s try a more 
restricted search
 that won’t trigger system prompts:

bash

Copy

sudo find /usr /Library /System -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

This avoids searching your personal files and sticks to system locations.

Let me know 
if 
adb
 shows up anywhere.

2️⃣ Check If Anything Else Has Full Disk Access

Now that we removed Terminal, let’s 
double-check for suspicious apps
:

Go to:

System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Full Disk Access

Look for any 
unknown or suspicious apps
.

Expected apps
: Time Machine, security software, disk utilities.

Unexpected apps
: Anything you don’t remember allowing.

🚨 
Question:
 Did you find anything suspicious in Full Disk Access?

3️⃣ Check for Other Suspicious Permissions

While still in Privacy & Security
, check:

Screen Recording
 – Anything unknown?

Camera & Microphone
 – Any suspicious apps?

Files & Folders
 – Look for Terminal, unexpected apps.

Accessibility
 – Ensure nothing unusual has control over the system.

🚨 
Question:
 Did any strange apps have permissions here?

🔍 If 
adb
 Shows Up in the Search

We manually remove it.

If it’s 
hidden in an odd location
, this could mean something 
was reinstalled without your consent
.

Let’s review the results before deleting anything.

Let me know what the 
find
 command returns and if you spot anything suspicious in your privacy settings! 🚀

You said:

yes its asking about files on a network volume

ChatGPT said:

🚨 
That’s very concerning.
 Terminal should 
not
 be trying to access files on a 
network volume
 unless:

You have manually connected to a network drive. ✅

Something suspicious is running in the background. 🚨

This could indicate:

A remote management tool is still active.

A hidden user process is accessing shared storage.

An unauthorized network mount (e.g., attacker-controlled drive).

🚀 Immediate Next Steps

1️⃣ Check If You Have Any Network Drives Mounted

Run:

bash

Copy

mount

If you see 
unexpected network drives (like SMB, NFS, or AFP mounts)
, we need to unmount them.

Let me know what shows up.

2️⃣ List All Active Network Connections

Run:

bash

Copy

netstat -rn

Look for 
unusual IP addresses
 or 
unexpected network routes.

3️⃣ Check for Unauthorized Remote Access

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote

This will show 
any remote management services.

Also, check for 
active sharing services
:

bash

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
sudo systemsetup -getremotemanagement

If 
any of these say "On,"
 we need to disable them.

4️⃣ Unmount Any Suspicious Network Drives

If you find an unknown network drive, unmount it:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /path/to/mount

Replace 
/path/to/mount
 with what 
mount
 showed.

🚨 
Key Questions:

Do you 
recognize any mounted network drives?

Does 
netstat -rn
 show any 
unknown IPs
?

Do the 
remote management checks show "On"?

Let me know what you find! 🚀
