isk Drill?

If you 
needed it for data recovery,
 it’s fine—but disable unnecessary background services.

If you 
no longer need it
, removing it 
fully
 is safest.

🚀 Let me know what you decide and if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 disappears after uninstalling or stopping Disk Drill!

yes I wanted to see how 'formatted' the drive actually was

Got it! That makes sense—
Disk Drill
 is useful for exploring formatted drives and attempting to recover lost files.

Next Steps:

1️⃣ After Uninstalling Disk Drill

If you're done with 
Disk Drill
 and no longer need to preview a drive, 
uninstalling
 as I mentioned earlier is a good idea for security and stability.

This will also help ensure that 
no hidden network mounts
 like 
.DDPreviewDisk
 remain active.

2️⃣ Check the Drive Format

If you're just curious about how 
the drive is formatted
, you can 
check the format without running Disk Drill
 by using Disk Utility or the Terminal:

Disk Utility
:

Open 
Disk Utility
 and select the drive. You'll see the format type (e.g., 
APFS
, **HFS+, 
exFAT
).

Terminal
:

Run this command to list all connected disks:

bash

Copy

diskutil list

Find your drive in the list and check its 
format type
.

3️⃣ Remove 
.DDPreviewDisk
 if No Longer Needed

If you’ve finished checking the drive and no longer need it mounted:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

Then check if the mount is removed after rebooting.

Security Tip:

Once you’re done, it’s always good practice to 
reset permissions
 on any sensitive drives or files to prevent unauthorized access. Disk Drill shouldn't leave any long-term issues, but it’s always best to double-check.

Let me know how it goes, and if anything unexpected pops up with the drive format or remaining mounts! 🚀

It looks like the 
Disk Drill
 process is not running in the background anymore (no active 
drill
 processes found). However, the suspicious 

.DDPreviewDisk
 mount
 is still there.

Here’s what we can do next:

Steps to Remove 
.DDPreviewDisk

Force Unmount 
.DDPreviewDisk

Since 
.DDPreviewDisk
 is still showing up in your mount list, let’s unmount it manually:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

This should forcefully remove it from the system.

Reboot and Check Again

After unmounting, reboot your Mac:

bash

Copy

sudo reboot

After rebooting, run the following to check if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 reappears:

bash

Copy

mount

If it 
doesn’t come back
, this suggests that it was indeed tied to 
Disk Drill
 or an associated process.

Further Checks:

Ensure Disk Drill Isn't Re-Installing or Running on Startup

Even though you stopped any processes, check if 
any remnants
 are configured to mount 
.DDPreviewDisk
 automatically on startup. Look for relevant files in these directories:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

Verify That You No Longer Need Disk Drill

If you're satisfied with the data recovery, 
consider uninstalling Disk Drill completely
 to prevent any future surprises:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Disk\ Drill.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Li
