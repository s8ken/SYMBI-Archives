Reasoned for 6m 30s

Nice=E2=80=94got it. I pulled a quick, surgica=
l read of the repo and README.

Snapshot =E2=80=94 what=E2=80=99s al=
ready strong

Clear problem/solution framing
 (AI trust, auditability, c=
ompliance) with a =E2=80=9Ccryptographic receipt=E2=80=9D angle and multi=
=E2=80=91provider orchestration (OpenAI/Anthropic/Perplexity) already calle=
d out. 

GitHub

Real repo structure
 in place (backend/ frontend/ tests/ m=
onitoring/ observability/ docs/ website/), plus ops artifacts for Vercel, R=
ailway/Heroku, Grafana/Prometheus, Playwright/Jest. 

GitHub

Operational docs present
 (DEPLOYMENT.md, SECURITY.md, SEC=
URITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md, OpenAPI spec). This signals maturity to technical bu=
yers and investors.

Demo is wired
 (Vercel), and README presents a concise =E2=

Environment files in repo

.env.production
, 
.env.demo*
, 
.env.example
 are visible at root. Even if sc=
rubbed, this is a trust smell for auditors/investors.

Action:

Remove all non=E2=80=91example env=
 files from git history; rotate any keys referenced; enforce secret scannin=
g (GitHub Advanced Security or gitleaks) on PRs.

PR hygiene

Top bar shows 
15 PRs

; 
0 issues
. That loo=
ks like =E2=80=9Ccode in motion, no triage.=E2=80=9D

Action:

Convert open decisions/work into 
Issues
 with labels (s=
ecurity, compliance, readiness, docs). Require linked issue in every PR bef=
ore merge. 

GitHub

Demo gate + messaging

The demo requires JS (fine), but the README should state 
demo scope, test account, and data policy
 up front to avoid hesitation.

Action:

Add =E2=80=9CDemo access=E2=80=9D =
section with temporary creds (or OAuth), data retention note, and rate limi=
ts.

GitHub

OpenAPI surfacing:
 the repo has 
openapi.yaml
; add a command to spin up Swagger=
 UI locally, and publish static API docs from 
docs/
 on GitHub Pages.
