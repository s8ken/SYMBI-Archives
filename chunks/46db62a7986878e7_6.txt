4) Make Pages/Docs real (Swagger =
UI / Redoc)

If you want 
/
 to render the OpenAPI nicely via GitHub Page=
s:

html

Copy code

<!-- docs/api-viewer.h=
tml -->

<!doctype 
html

Ensure Pages workflow publishes 
docs/
 (you already added a=
 workflow; confirm it targets the right folder and Pages is enabled in 
Settings =E2=86=92 Pages
=
).

5) Strengthen SECURITY.md (contac=
t & SLA)

Add a crisp disclosure channel and=
 response window:

md

Copy code

## Reporting a Vulnerability=

Please email security@yseeku.com with details (PoC, impact, version). We ac=
knowledge in 48h and target a fix or mitigation within 7 business days for =
High/Critical issues. Do not publicly disclose prior to a coordinated advis=
ory.

=F0=9F=A7=AA =E2=80=9CGolden Path=
=E2=80=9D verifications (fast checks)

Golden Path doc present
 and linked from README. (Keep =
the 60=E2=80=91sec cURL =E2=86=92 receipt =E2=86=92 verify flow accessible =
in one scroll.)

Badges
: CI + Security badges should reflect the exact =
workflow filenames (after we commit the above).

API Docs badge
 should hit the Pages URL (e.g., 
/docs/api-viewer.html
 or repo p=
ages root).

EU AI Act mapping
 is included; keep a disclaimer that =
it=E2=80=99s a 
mapping, not c=
ertification
.

=F0=9F=93=8C Commit bundle (you c=
an paste these)

bash

Copy code

git checkout -b chore/hardening

printf

"# --- security: never commit env ---\n=
.env\n.env.*\n!.env.example\n"

 >> .gitignore

mkdir

 -p .gi=

git add .gitignore .github docs/api-viewer.html
git commit -m 

"chore: harden repo =

# history purge is a separate, de=
structive step (see above)

Important:
 after history rewrite, you 
must
 re-create PRs/branches from fresh clo=
nes. Notify any collaborators of the forced push.
