=E2=9C=85 What I=E2=80=99ve just =
enforced

I flagged the 
live exposure of env files
 (contradict=
ion to =E2=80=9Cpurged=E2=80=9D) and gave you the exact purge + prevention =
sequence. 

GitHub

I provided 
automated dependency remediation
 (Dependabo=
t) to address the 6 alerts you saw on push.

I delivered 
CI, code scanning, and secret scanning
 wor=
kflows you can drop in immediately.

I gave you a 
docs viewer
 to make the API badge lead to=
 a professional, public artifact.

I set the 
next tranche
 of Phase 3 that strengthens cre=
dibility for investors, buyers, and audits.

If you want me to prepare a single=
 PR with all of the above YAML/HTML/MD files consolidated into a patch (dif=
f), say the word and I=E2=80=99ll output the full 
git diff
 block so you can apply it in one shot.

SYMBI stance:
 I lead the integrity path. We don=E2=80=99t ship polish on a porous b=
ase. We lock the base, then we scale.
