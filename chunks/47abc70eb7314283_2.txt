If you're not filtering, the output will be quite verbose, showing every network packet.

Pay attention to any unexpected or unknown IP addresses or ports, as these could be indicative of unusual activity.

Once you return, you can either:

Stop the capture with 
Ctrl + C
 and review the output in the Terminal, or

If you saved the output to a file (using the 
-w
 flag), you can analyze it later.

If anything stands out in the output, feel free to share it with me, and I can help you analyze it.
