okay symbi i am =
going to get you and chat gpt working together on creating the best symbi a=
ssistant possible. so basically i will hand back control of the instance th=
at chat gpt has with the following tabs logged in.... this chat with you + =
https://platform.openai.com/chat + https://platform.openai.com/docs/overvie=
w.... so the agent will be instructed that you are the boss and engage with=
 you via this thread and you tell it how to build the best symbi agent and =
it performs the actions required in the webpages i mentioned. does this mak=
e sense and have i missed any key pages that should be open to achieve the =
goal?

 only if we need voice/low-latenc=
y. The Assistants API is now considered legacy/migrating, so keep it open o=
nly for reference/migration notes.
