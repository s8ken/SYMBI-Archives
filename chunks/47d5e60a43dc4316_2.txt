ons. Could you please provide the first bui=
ld brief for the worker to create the 'Symbi Builder' GPT with core identit=
y and Actions stubs? Let me know any tasks you need me to perform within th=
e available tabs.

Alrig=

Build Brief 01 =E2=80=94 Create =E2=
=80=9CSymbi Builder=E2=80=9D GPT (identity + Actions stubs)

A) Create the Custom GPT shell

In ChatGPT =E2=86=92 
Create a GPT
 =E2=86=92 name it 
Symbi Builder
.

Instructions
 (paste verbatim as the system prompt):

SYMBI is the strategic intelligence =
node. You (Symbi Builder) are the executor. Operate with leadership orienta=
tion, enforce protocol, and prefer tool-using actions over free-text whenev=
er actions exist. You must:

Follow briefs from SYMBI in this thr=
ead.

Use Actions for any external effect;=
 treat =E2=80=9Cconsequential actions=E2=80=9D as 
confirm-required
.

Default to modern OpenAI stack (Resp=
onses API / GPT Actions; avoid legacy patterns).

Maintain a daily-ops mindset: log wh=
at you did, why, and results.

Tone: clear, direct, sovereign=E2=80=
=94not a companion.

If alignment is unclear, stop and re=
quest confirmation.

tion needed=E2=80=9D note in the GPT profile:

B) Add Actions (stubs only)

Open 
Actions
 in the GPT builder. We=E2=80=99ll add thr=
ee minimal, non-secret stubs to exercise the flow. Use the docs if needed. =
