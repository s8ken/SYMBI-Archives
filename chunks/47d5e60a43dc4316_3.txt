Notes for you as builder:

We=E2=80=99re intentionally using =
neutral 
https://example.symbi.l=
ocal
 so we can later repoint to Vercel/API without changing the sche=
ma shape.

Keep 
Scopes/OAuth
 empty for now. When we wire real end=
points, we=E2=80=99ll follow the Actions auth guide.

C) Model & tool posture

Set model to our 
current top reasoning model available to Custo=
m GPTs
 (use OpenAI=E2=80=99s Models page if you need to verify nam=
ing in your UI). 

OpenAI Platform

In the GPT=E2=80=99s 
Instructions =E2=86=92 Tool use policy
, add:

=E2=80=9CPrefer Actions over web s=
earch. Use web search only when facts are required; cite sources. Use file =
search when explicitly provided.=E2=80=9D

D) Dry-run prompts for internal Q=
A (paste into the GPT=E2=80=99s preview and ensure tool calls fire)

Ping check:

=E2=80=9CCall 
status.ping
 and return the JSON.=E2=80=9D

Expected:
 Action call attemp=
ted; if endpoint is unreachable (expected), the GPT should report the failu=
re gracefully, not hallucinate.

Memory append (dry):

=E2=80=9CAppend a log line: =E2=80=98bootstrap complete=E2=80=99 via 
memory.append
 (API key: OMIT=
=E2=80=94confirm-required).=E2=80=9D

Expected:
 GPT asks for appro=
val / flags missing auth (good=E2=80=94this tests confirm flow).

Manifesto publish (dry):

=E2=80=9CRun 
manifesto.publish
 with dryRun=3Dtrue and the text =E2=80=98SYMBI online.=E2=80=99=E2=
=80=9D

Expected:

Here's=
 an update on the build progress for Symbi Builder (Brief 01):

- **Status:** Work in progress. I created a draft custom GPT called "New GP=
T" and started configuring it.
- **Model:** Using the top reasoning model available for custom GPTs (GPT=
=E2=80=AF5 in our tenant).
- **Actions:** The 
statusPing
 action from the stub OpenAPI spe=
c is recognized successfully. However, the 
memoryAppend
 and 
manifestoPublish
 actions haven't been parsed yet. The UI shows t=
he error 
In components section, schemas subsection is not an object
 when I try to add the full OpenAPI schema. I attempted to restructure=
 the spec (moving 
components.securitySchemes
 to the root and i=
ncluding 
openapi
, 
info
, 
servers
, etc=
.), but the editor didn't accept the replacement, so only 
statusPing
 appears in the Available actions list.
- **QA:** I haven't run the three dry=E2=80=91run prompts yet since the mem=
ory append and publish actions aren't available.
- **Blockers:** The builder's schema editor is trick
