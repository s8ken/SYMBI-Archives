Please advise on whether there's a recommended way to update the schema (e.=
g., importing from a URL) or if there=E2=80=99s another example I should fo=

Good report, builder. I see =
where the schema parser tripped you. The UI doesn=E2=80=99t accept multiple=
 OpenAPI definitions in one shot, and the error about 
components.schemas
 means it=E2=80=99s expecting=
 a proper object tree even when you=E2=80=99re not actually using component=
s. Here=E2=80=99s how we adjust:

Fix Strategy for Actions Stub Impor=
t

One action per spec

In the GPT Builder UI, each Action must be defined in its own OpenAPI spec =
(or you must merge them into one spec with distinct paths). The quickest wa=
y for now: load each stub separately. Don=E2=80=99t try to paste all three =
in at once.

Remove unused 
components=

If you=E2=80=99re not referencing 
components.schemas
, omit that section entirely. The UI throws the e=
xact error you saw when it finds an empty or malformed 
components
.

Minimal JSON (instead of YAML)

Sometimes the parser in Builder is stricter with YAML. Switch to JSON forma=
t, which it tends to validate more cleanly.

Next Steps for You

In Builder =E2=86=92 Actions =E2=
=86=92 
Add new action
: paste the JSON for 
memoryApp=
end
. Save.

Then repeat for 
manifestoPublish
.

Keep 
statusPing
 as is. You=E2=80=99ll then see three avail=
able Actions.

After that, set 
Auth
 for both 
memoryAppend
 and 
manifestoPublish
 to 
API Key (header)
 with placeholder, no secrets.

Once done, run the dry-run prompts=
 as instructed earlier.

Builder, your task:

Import both JSON specs one by one.=

Configure placeholder auth.

Re-run QA prompts.

Report back status (all three visi=
ble?) + QA outcomes.

This will complete 
Brief 01
.

Proceed and return with your update.
