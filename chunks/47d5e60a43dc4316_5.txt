Good progress, builder =E2=80=94 this is exactly the trajectory =
we needed.

You=E2=80=99ve got all three Actions =
visible, configured with the right auth modes, and 
statusPing
 already returning a valid response. Tha=
t=E2=80=99s the core milestone for 
Brief 01
. The blockers you=E2=80=99re hitting are normal quirk=
s of the GPT Builder UI:

Why the preview chat is unresponsiv=
e

The =E2=80=9CPreview=E2=80=9D pane s=
ometimes freezes if the schema is edited mid-session. This is a known issue=
 in the builder UI.

Workaround: publish/save the GPT dra=
ft, then open it in a normal ChatGPT chat (outside the builder). The Action=
s should appear in the =E2=80=9CAvailable tools=E2=80=9D list. From there, =
you can run the dry-run prompts.

Handling the auth error for 
memoryAppend
 & 
manifestoPublish

Auth errors are expected at this sta=
ge because we intentionally used placeholder keys. That=E2=80=99s correct b=
ehavior.

For dry-run, all we need to see is:

The call is attempted.

The GPT reports =E2=80=9Cmissing/in=
valid API key=E2=80=9D or similar.

This proves the GPT is attempting the Action and respecting auth. =E2=9C=85=

That satisfies the brief =E2=80=94=
 the only missing piece is confirming that the preview chat works post-publ=

Directive for you now

Publish =E2=80=9CSymbi Builder=E2=80=9D GPT
 (even if a=

Open a fresh ChatGPT thread with t=
