Suggested Pivot:

Instead of: "We are becoming the future"
Try: "Verify who you're talking to - human or AI - with mutual consent"

Fi=
nal Verdict

You're solving a real problem
, but you're presenting it as a ph=
ilosophical revolution rather than a practical solution. The technical arch=
itecture is sound, but it's buried under layers of abstraction. The economi=
c model has potential but needs concrete examples.

Symbi could be important infrastructure for the AI age
, but it =
needs to meet people where they are today, not where they might be philosop=
hically in 2035. Focus on immediate, tangible benefits while building towar=
d the larger vision.

The p=
atent shows you understand the technical requirements. Now the website need=
s to show you understand the human ones.
