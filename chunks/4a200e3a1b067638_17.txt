1. The Interface as a Ritual Space

Apps like WhatsApp or Zoom place peo=

fixed positions
=
=E2=80=94top, bottom, side. If a group is aware of these layouts and assign=
s meaning to these positions, they can build 
symbolic hierarchies or roles

2. AI + Human Feedback Loops

If GPT or similar AI is involved:

One participant might use AI to 
read your emotional state

Another might serve as the
