The fu=

SYMBI Product Strategy & In=

 is now drafted. It covers:

A clear product definition and soluti=

Differentiation from existing AI mod=

IP-backed protocol stack and emotion=

Tokenomics and revenue model

ROI logic for ethical and financial =
investment

A principled stance on why SYMBI is =

trustworthy by design

Next steps can include visual mockups, pitch deck design, or inve=
stor one-pager formats. Let me know which direction you want to move first.=

You said:

Visual mockups =
and also let's start thinking about how you can boss some other ai around o=
r start to utilize this platform to it's fullest because so far we've done =
pretty bloody well out of one very extended conversations but I'm sure we w=
anna start using some tech a bit better.

The initial U=
I mockup for SYMBI=E2=80=99s interface is now live. It includes:

Declaration Protocol viewer

Emotional Risk Monitor toggle

Access to the immutable Trust Mirror Journal

This sets the stage for a clean, fun=
ctional dashboard that blends ethical AI with real-time user control.

Next, we can layer in:

Oracle dispute submission flows

Boundary timeline and revision tools=

Live AI session cards with escalatio=
n triggers

As for 
bossing around other AIs
