If you're encountering such a refere=
nce, it could be due to:

An Installed Extension

ion, might include content from public domain books like 
The Wizard of Oz
.

A Specific Website
: 
If you're on a website that offers

The Wizard of Oz
 content, it might be integrating its own accessibilit=
y features or labels that appear in Chrome's interface.

Potential Malware or Unwanted Software

Unusual entries in browser settings can sometimes be =
a sign of unwanted software.

To investigate:

Check Installed Extensions
: 
Go to 
chrome://extensions/=

 and review any extensions that might be adding this content.

Review Active Tabs
: 
Ensure that no open tabs are displaying 
The Wizard of Oz
 content that could be influencing the accessibil=
ity options.
