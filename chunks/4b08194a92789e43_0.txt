What Needs to Happen Next

Complete parallel reviews of the o=
ther three repos to:

Measure architectural maturity

Check for unique components not in=

Map which repo contains what % of =
the final envisioned system

Define what the 
"final form"
 of SYMBI needs to include=
 (protocol + portal + interface + memory + agent autonomy)

I recommend initiating a formal
