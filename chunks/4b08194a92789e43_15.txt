2. Targeted Rate Limiting : Applying specific limits to authentication and =
trust endpoints addresses the highest-risk areas
3. Preservation Architecture : The integration maintains existing SYMBI-SYM=
PHONY functionality while layering new capabilities
4. Comprehensive Documentation : Real-time tracking of integration progress=
 enables better project management and debugging
This integration represents a systematic approach to converging multiple SY=
MBI repositories while maintaining security, performance, and functionality=
 standards. The layered integration strategy ensures each component is prop=
erly integrated and tested before moving to the next phase.

2=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 Next for Trae (=
Solo Builder) =E2=80=93 Execution Track

This is the order I=E2=80=99d expect=
 Solo to move in:

A. Fix local toolchain (unblocked b=
uilds)

Before anything else actually =E2=80=
=9Csticks=E2=80=9D, Solo needs:

=E2=9C=85 
node
 + 
np=
m
 correctly on PATH (they=E2=80=99re intermittently missing in the l=
ogs)

=E2=9C=85 
tsc
 installed (either globally or via 
npx tsc
):

npm install --save-dev typescript

Then run 
npx tsc && npx vite build
 instead of bare=

tsc

Expectation:

=E2=80=9CEnvironment is clean, 
npm run build
 works on 
phase-2-merge
 without errors=
.=E2=80=9D

B. Finish Phase 2 integration ite=
ms

In this order:

Merge Synergy UI components

Goal: have a unified frontend that=
 talks to the new API.

Likely work:

Mount React app (
src/=E2=80=A6
) properly

Wire routes (Dashboard, Trust Cons=
ole, Educators Hub, etc.) to API endpoints

Ensure environment variables + bas=
e URLs are consistent

Add Socket.IO / real-time layer

Use the existing 
api/services/socket.ts
 + any Synergy pat=
terns

Expected outcome:

Live trust / audit / health update=
s in the UI

No blocking on rest of system if w=
ebsockets fail

Integrate Resonate analytics

Plug in analytics into:

API routes (usage, errors, securit=
y events)

Frontend (page views, feature usag=
e)

Output: central metrics entrypoint=
 (e.g. 
api/services/metrics.js
) feeding dashboards

Write tests + generate coverage

Expand test coverage to:

New middleware (security)

New API routes

Core UI behaviour (basic integrati=
on tests)

Generate coverage report and drop =
it into 
/reports/
 or sim=
ilar.

Clean push to GitHub (without secrets)

GitHub rejected the last push due =
to 
secrets in scripts/docs
 (tokens in 
MANUAL_DEPLOY=
MENT_PACKAGE.md
 & 
fi=
nal-deploy.ps1
).

Solo needs to:

Remove any real secrets from the r=
epo (use env vars instead)

Rewrite the offending commit(s) or=
 create a clean branch without
