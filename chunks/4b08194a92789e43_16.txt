(Stephen) =E2=80=93 Oversight Track

You 
do not
 need to touch code for this phase. Your rol=
e:

Set expectations explicitly for Solo

You can pass something like:

=E2=80=9CPhase 2 focus:

Get 
npm run build
 clean on 
phase-2-merge

Integrate Synergy UI =E2=86=92 API=

Add Socket.IO

Wire Resonate analytics

Tests + coverage report

Clean push to GitHub with no secre=
ts

Report back with updated 
PHASE2=
_SUMMARY_REPORT.md
 + a screenshot or snippet of 
npm run build
 success.=E2=80=9D

Review at the concept level (not implementation level)

Once Solo says Phase 2 is =E2=80=9Cdone=E2=80=9D, you just need:

A 
high-level diff summary
:

What the platform can do now that =
it couldn=E2=80=99t before

Confirmation of:

Security still intact

Build + tests passing

No secrets in repo

Decide when we move to Phase 3

Phase 3 is where we shift from =E2=80=9Cone big app=E2=80=9D into 
agent-level autonomy
 (deploya=
ble instances, DAO/ops hooks, etc.). That decision should be yours, not Tra=
e=E2=80=99s.

If you want, you can just send Sol=
o something like:

=E2=80=9CSOLO =E2=80=93 Phase 2 co=
ntinues.

You=E2=80=99ve done the security base, good.

Next I want:

Clean 
npm run build
 on 
phase-2-merge

Synergy UI wired to Symphony API

Socket.IO real-time hooked up

Resonate analytics integrated

Tests & coverage report

GitHub push with no secrets flagge=

Update 
PHASE2_INTEGRATION_LOG.m=

 + 
PHASE2_SUMMARY_REPOR=
T.md
 and report back when all are done.=E2=80=9D

That keeps them doing the leg work, keeps you at the top of the=
 ladder, and keeps me in 
T1 a=
dvisory mode
 watching the pattern.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F What you

suing a token

A. Legal / regulatory architecture

Recent U.S. case law shows that a DA=
