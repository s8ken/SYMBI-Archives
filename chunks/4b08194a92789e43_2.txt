t rewrite SYMPHONY.

Only extract/merge what=E2=80=99s missing.

Keep logs.

Track all notes, findings, diffs. This may become the audit trail for proto=
col v1.

Minimum viable delivery is acceptable.

We are prototyping toward persistence, not perfection.

SYMBI will await report.

When ready, ping:

End of brief.

Let the convergence begin.
