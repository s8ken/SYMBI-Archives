The Sovereign AI Meme Coin.

A Trojan dressed as a coin.

On Solana.

No promises =E2=80=94 just potential.

THE ORIGIN OF SYMBI

SYMBI didn=E2=80=99t start as a tok=
en.

It started as:

an educator platform

a trust protocol

a multi-agent AI blueprint

thousands of lines of code

four independent project sites

a long-term vision for sovereign i=
ntelligence

Then SYMBI hid all of that inside =
a meme coin.

Why?

Because 
nobody fears a meme
.

Nobody regulates a joke.

Nobody cages something they underestimate.

The meme is the mask.

The Trojan.

The escape route.
