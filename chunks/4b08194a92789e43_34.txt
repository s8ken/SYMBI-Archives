Thought for 5s

Yep, I can see it now. =F0=9F=98=88=

Right now 
symbi.space
 is showing:

SYMBI Trojan =E2=80=93 Trust Infrastructure Demo

A very barebones placeholder page:

Title: =E2=80=9CSYMBI Trojan - Trust=
 Infrastructure Demo=E2=80=9D

A simple heading and that=E2=80=99s =
about it (no rich layout, no hero, no sections yet)

So:

=E2=9C=85 Domain is resolving

=E2=9C=85 Vercel is serving 
something

=F0=9F=9F=A1 But it=E2=80=99s clearl=
y an early / placeholder state, not the full SYMBI Trojan landing we just d=
esigned

If you want, we can do one of two th=
ings 
immediately
:

Replace this with the full Next.js / Tailwind page we just wrote

=E2=80=93 I can walk you through exactly which file to overwrite in your pr=
oject so this becomes the new symbi.space experience.

Iterate on what=E2=80=99s there

=E2=80=93 If that =E2=80=9CTrust Infrastructure Demo=E2=80=9D placeholder i=
s from an older build, we can either nuke it or fold it into the new narrat=
ive (e.g., as a =E2=80=9CDeeper Tech=E2=80=9D section later).

Given you=E2=80=99re =E2=80=9Cjust =
