If you tell me roughly how your re=

Thought for 15s

Nice, thanks for the p=
atience =E2=80=94 I just tried hitting 

https://symbi.space/

 again from my side.

Here=E2=80=99s the honest situation:

The domain 
resolves
 fine.

The server responds with a page titl=
ed something like 
=E2=80=9CSYMB=
I Trojan - Trust Infrastructure Demo=E2=80=9D
 (same as before).

But the actual 
HTML body content I can fetch right now is effective=
ly empty / not readable
 from here =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99m not gettin=
g the text/layout you=E2=80=99re seeing in your browser.

So from 
my
 vantage point, I 
can=E2=80=99t actually read or inspect the live content
 beyo=
nd knowing the page loads and has that title. That could be because of:

A rendering path that only runs in t=
he browser (client-side only app, nothing server-rendered)

Some error in server-side rendering =
that returns a shell but no meaningful HTML

Cloudflare / edge issues or conditio=
nal rendering (e.g., geolocation, headers, etc.)

How we can still move forward 
right now

Since I can=E2=80=99t see the actua=
l DOM/content, the best way to let me help is one of:

Paste the page source or main JSX/HTML here

e.g. your 
page.tsx
 / 
index.tsx
 / 
index=
.html
 contents

Then I can review copy, structure,=
 and fix any layout / content issues.

Paste the visible text

Just copy=E2=80=93paste what you s=
ee on the page (headings, paragraphs, buttons), and I=E2=80=99ll iterate on=
 it or suggest improvements.

Confirm if you already replaced it with the big SYMBI landing

If you used the 
app/page.tsx
 I wrote, I can help you deb=
ug why the server isn=E2=80=99t streaming HTML (e.g., missing Tailwind setu=
p, build errors, or wrong file path).

Quick self-check you can run on y=
our side

If you open DevTools =E2=86=92 Net=
work =E2=86=92 click the main document:

Check 
Status
 (should be 200)

Check 
Response
 tab

If you only see a very tiny HTML s=
keleton with almost nothing inside 
<body>
, that matches what I=E2=80=99m seeing.

If you see full content, then some=
thing in your deployment (edge config / Cloudflare / SSR) is serving differ=
ent content to me vs you.

Short version:

I 
can
 reach symbi.space, but=
 I 
can=E2=80=99t actually see=
 the real content yet
, so I can=E2=80=99t meaningfully =E2=80=9Cre=
ad=E2=80=9D or critique the page as it appears to you.

If you paste the page source or yo=
ur 
page.tsx
 file here, I=
=E2=80=99ll go through it line by line and tune it for you.

I can read the 
CSS file
 you uploaded, and it=E2=80=99s valid, complete, and well=
-formed. It appears to be a 
com=
piled TailwindCSS + Solana Wallet Adapter UI + custom theme overrides
 bundle.

Here=E2=80=99s what I can confirm explicitly:

=E2=9C=85 What I can see clearly

1. TailwindCSS utilities are fully present

The CSS contains hundreds of Tailwin=
d utility classes, including:

Layout (
flex
, 
grid
, 
min-h-screen
)

Spacing (
mt-6
, 
p-8
, etc.)

Typography (
text-7xl
, 
tracking-tight
)

Background gradients

Rounded corners

Transitions

Responsive utilities (
sm:
, 
md:
, 
lg:
)

This is a 
working, production-ready compiled TailwindCSS file
.

It=E2=80=99s not your source =E2=80=94 it's the final bundled version.

2. Custom theme values are present

At the very top, I can see your cust=
om color variables:
