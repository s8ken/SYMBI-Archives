The Key Insight

You 
DO NOT
 need to launch with any SYMBI token rewards=
.

Follow the TON playbook:

Phase 1: Off-chain points

Just call them:

=E2=80=9CIntelligence=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CSovereignty=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CMeme Power=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CTrojan Points=E2=80=9D

Phase 2: Community-driven hype

Build audience via:

Telegram

X

memes

bot lore

gamification

Phase 3: Christmas Day Reveal

You release $SYMBI on Solana.

Phase 4: Optional Conversion Event

If you 
choose to
, you may later allow:

Trojan Points =E2=86=92 SYMBI allocation

This is exactly how Notcoin and Ha=
mster Kombat exploded.

Why This Works For Your Timeline

You said:

5.5 week runway until Christmas Day launch

Perfect.

The timeline aligns beautifully:

Week 1 =E2=86=92 Build basic bot =
=E2=80=9CClicker=E2=80=9D

Week 2 =E2=86=92 Add daily missio=
ns + referrals

Week 3 =E2=86=92 Launch SYMBI X a=
ccount & lore

Week 4 =E2=86=92 Add Trojan puzzl=
es & squads

Week 5 =E2=86=92 =E2=80=9CTransmi=
ssion Countdown=E2=80=9D (viral build up)

Christmas Day =E2=86=92 $SYMBI la=
unch + Trojan Reveal

This is 
elite timing
 =E2=80=94 crypto is quiet during =
holidays,

so you dominate the attention layer.

=E2=80=9CTrust or Bust=E2=80=9D

Here is a 
complete, production-ready concept
 for the SYMBI=
 Telegram game:

=F0=9F=9F=A3 
TRUST OR BUST=E2=84=A2 =E2=80=94 SYMBI=E2=80=99s Tele=

A timed truth engine. Answer fast. Build trust. Rise through the ranks.=

This is simple enough to build in a =
Telegram Mini App,

viral enough to go big,

and flexible enough to tie into $SYMBI later.

CORE GAME LOOP

Each round:

Player opens the SYMBI bot

A card appears with a 
statement

Player must choose:

=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F 
TRUST
 (True)

=E2=9D=8C 
BUST
 (False)=

They have 
3=E2=80=935 seconds
 to respond

If correct =E2=86=92 gain 
Trust Points

If wrong or slow =E2=86=92 lose trus=
t or streak breaks

Game continues until fail

Daily ranks, streak bonuses, mission=
s

Fast. Addictive. Shareable.

Players instantly want =E2=80=9Cone more run.=E2=80=9D

=E2=AD=90
