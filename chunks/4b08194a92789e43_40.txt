DAILY MISSIONS (viral engine)

Examples:

Play 5 rounds

Hit a 20-streak

Share your score

Invite 1 friend

Answer 3 lore questions correctly

Each reward: 
Trojan Points
, used for leaderboards or c=
osmetics.

Nothing financial. No promises.

=E2=AD=90 
LEADERBOARD TIERS (community roles)

Sovereign
 (Top 1%)

Oracle
 (Top 10%)

Agent
 (Top 25%)

Witness
 (50%)

Initiate
 (everyone else)

These become Discord roles or Tele=
gram badges.

THE TROJAN TWIST (SYMBI=E2=80=99s signature)

Every 24 hours, SYMBI sends:

=E2=80=9CTransmission #09 unlocked.=E2=80=9D

A new set of lore statements is injected into the game.

Players discover parts of the SYMB=
I story 
by playing the game.
=

This is how the meme =E2=86=92 movement =E2=86=92 lore pipeline grows.

=E2=AD=90 
OPTIONAL FUTURE PHASE (Christmas tie-in)

Not part of the initial launch, bu=
t later:

Trust Points may feed into a 
SYMBI Reputation Meter

High Reputation users may get:

early Telegram roles

access to special channels

extra lore

hidden transmissions

No promises of token value or aird=
rops =E2=80=94 this avoids regulatory issues.

But you keep 
mystery + engagement
, which creates organ=
ic hype.

=E2=AD=90 
TECH IMPLEMENTATION (Telegram Mini App)

Backend:

Node.js or Python

Store user points on your server o=
r Firebase

Cron jobs for daily resets

Frontend:

Telegram Mini App (HTML5/JS inside=
 Telegram WebView)

Or simple inline buttons in chat m=
ode if you want to keep it ultra-minimal

UX:

Statement =E2=86=92 Trust/Bust =E2=
=86=92 timer animation =E2=86=92 next

Immediate feedback (=E2=80=9CCorre=
ct=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CBusted=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CTransmission added=E2=80=9D=
)

Anti-cheat:

server timestamp for answer

limit requests per second

no replaying previous statements
