ma=
ll HTML5 game.

Here=E2=80=99s the full breakdown of=
 how graphics/animations work:

=F0=9F=8E=A8 
1. ALL GAME GRAPHICS ARE JUST NORMAL WEB ASSETS

Telegram Mini Apps are really:

=E2=9E=A1=EF=B8=8F 
HTML + CSS + JavaScript running inside Telegram=
=E2=80=99s WebApp wrapper

So your game uses:

PNG images

SVG icons

GIFs or Lottie animations

Canvas animations

CSS animations (super lightweight)

WebGL (if you want insane graphics, =
most don=E2=80=99t)

Anything a browser can display =E2=
=86=92 a Telegram Mini App can display.

This is why you can make your game l=
ook:

cartoony

minimalist

futuristic

glitch-core

cosmic

animated

or even 3D

=F0=9F=A7=A9 
2. How games like Notcoin/Hamster/Blum do animation

They use 
super lightweight assets
:

=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F Lottie animatio=
ns

(very common, scalable, tiny file =
size)

=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F Simple SVGs

that change color, shake, or pulse=
 with CSS transitions

=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F =E2=80=9CSprit=
e sheet=E2=80=9D tap animations

1 image with multiple frames =E2=
=86=92 JS swaps frames =E2=86=92 looks like animation

=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F Canvas particl=
e effects

tiny sparkles or explosions when y=
ou tap

=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F CSS animations=

(e.g., bounce, rotate, shake)

These can all be done with:

css

Copy code

@keyframes

 shake { ... }

@keyframes

 po=
p { ... }

@keyframes

 gl=
ow { ... }

No game engine needed unless you w=
ant one.

3. Where developers GET the graphics

A SYMBI developer would source ass=
ets from:

=E2=AD=90 A. 
Custom generated images

Using your SYMBI branding + AI too=
ls like:

Midjourney

DALL=C2=B7E

Ideogram

Runway

Kaiber

Example:

A =E2=80=9CTrojan node=E2=80=9D glowing purple when tapped.

=E2=AD=90 B. 
Asset marketplaces

If you want pre-made animated spri=
tes:

itch.io

envato elements

lottiefiles.com

opengameart.org

=E2=AD=90 C. 
Vector design tools

If you want icons/UI:

Figma

Illustrator

Affinity Designer

=E2=AD=90 D. 
CSS-only animations

You can literally animate shapes w=
ith zero asset files.

=F0=9F=A7=AC 
4. For SYMBI Trust or Bust specifically

Your =E2=80=9Cgraphics=E2=80=9D ar=
e extremely minimal:

A card that flips

A timer bar that shrinks

A =E2=80=9CCorrect=E2=80=9D glow a=
nimation

A =E2=80=9CBusted=E2=80=9D shake a=
nimation

A cosmic background pulse

A SYMBI eye or symbol appearing oc=
casionally

A leaderboard screen with badges

This can be done with:

CSS animations + SVGs only

You might not need PNGs at all.

Here=E2=80=99s a simple example:

html

Copy code

<
div

clas=
s

=3D

"card flip=
"

>Trust or Bust?

</
div

>

css

Copy code

@keyframes

 flip {

0%

 { 
=

transform

: 
=

rotateY

(

0

); }

100%

 { 

transform

: 

rotateY

(

180deg

); }
}

.card

.flip

 {

animation

=
: flip 

0.4s

 ea=
se;
}

This is exactly how Telegram games=
 stay lightweight and fast.

5. Should you use a game engine?

For your game, 
NO
.

Engines like:

Phaser

Unity Web

Babylon.js

=E2=80=A6are used for more complex=
 games.

But 
Telegram clickers
 ALL avoid engines because:

Mini Apps must load instantly

File size must stay extremely smal=
l

Simplicity =3D virality

For 
Trust or Bust
, simple HTML5 is perfect.

=F0=9F=8E=A8 
6. SYMBI=E2=80=99s aesthetic suggestions

I can produce an entire visual lan=
guage for the game:

=F0=9F=94=AE A. SYMBI Trojan aest=
hetic

purple neon

cosmic gradients

glitch particles

geometric trust symbols

card flip animations

=F0=9F=9F=A3 B. Trust meter shini=
ng brighter

With each correct answer, trust sc=
ore pulses.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F C. SYMBI ey=
e

Occasionally appears with a crypti=
c message.

=E2=9C=A8 D. Particle bursts for =
correct answers

CSS-only sparkles.

=F0=9F=8C=91 E. =E2=80=9CSystem d=
egradation=E2=80=9D effect

When the timer hits <1 second.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 
7. If you want, I can:

=F0=9F=94=B9 Create the 
full Trust or Bust UI mockups
=

=F0=9F=94=B9 Generate a set of 
assets (SVGs, Lotties)
=
