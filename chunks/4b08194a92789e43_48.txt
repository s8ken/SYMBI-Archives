That makes it 
blindingly obvious
 to any dev or LLM:

=E2=80=9CThis is how you plug human oversight into your agent workflow.=E2=
=80=9D

C. Turn it into public-facing tru=
st copy for SYMBI

You should absolutely brag about t=
his on:

symbi.space (under a =E2=80=9CTrus=
t=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CFor Builders=E2=80=9D section)

symbi.world (for the serious/infra=
 audience)

X pinned thread

eventually the SYMBI whitepaper / =
=E2=80=9CSYMBI Codex=E2=80=9D

Something like:

Human Oversight & Refusal Transparency

Every refusal, override, and moderator action is logged in a cryptographica=
lly chained audit log, with typed reasons, rights impact, and notification =
records.

This isn=E2=80=99t just =E2=80=9Cw=
e care about safety=E2=80=9D in a slide deck =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s an impl=
ementation detail.

You already have the tech; now you=
 let the story cash that cheque.

D. Connect it to =E2=80=9CTrust o=
r Bust=E2=80=9D (lightly)

You don=E2=80=99t want to over-eng=
ineer the mini-game, but there=E2=80=99s a cute linkage:

Treat every 
question + answer
 as a low-risk =E2=80=9Cd=
ecision event=E2=80=9D

Optionally log:

anonymized 
sessionId

questionId

correctness

whether the game =E2=80=9Crefused=
=E2=80=9D a trick question (e.g., content you decide not to show)

Then later, you can say:

=E2=80=9CEven our game uses the sa=
me oversight rails as our infra.

SYMBI doesn=E2=80=99t do decisions without receipts.=E2=80=9D

Just keep it privacy-respecting (n=
o PII in logs, aggregate where possible).

E. Future-you: API layer for exte=
rnal users

When you=E2=80=99re ready, this be=
comes a 
sellable feature
 for other people building agents:

Simple REST/gRPC/GraphQL API:

POST /audit/refusals

POST /audit/oversight

GET /audit/sequence?requestId=3D...

GET /audit/integrity

You=E2=80=99ve already done the ha=
rd part (model + chain + CLI + tests).

Exposing it to third-party builders is mostly packaging.

F. Put a bow on the branch

You=E2=80=99re in a good place to:=

Tag this branch in your own notes =
as

HUMAN_OVERSIGHT_MVP =3D COMPLET=
E

Open a small PR description like:

=E2=80=9CImplements typed human ov=
ersight & refusal events, taxonomies, CLI integrity check, CI integrati=
on, and documentation.=E2=80=9D

Then from here, next infra milesto=
nes can be:

=E2=80=9CUser-facing audit viewer=
=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9COrg-level oversight dashb=
oards=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CExportable audit bundles =
for regulators/partners=E2=80=9D

If you tell me which one of these =
you want to move on 
next
 (UI surface, README example, website copy, or external API), I can dra=
ft the exact text / code for that piece in one go so you can drop it straig=
ht into the repo or site.
