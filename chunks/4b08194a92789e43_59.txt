Short version: the report is still a 
good
 December-2024 snapshot, but it=E2=80=99s now 
too pessimistic
 in a few key places. Y=
ou=E2=80=99ve actually closed a bunch of the =E2=80=9Cred gaps=E2=80=9D it =
calls out, especially around tests, trust protocol maturity, and audit/over=
sight.

I=E2=80=99ll break it into:

=F0=9F=94=B4 Things that are now 
wrong / outdated

=F0=9F=9F=A1 Things that are 
partly outdated

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Things that are still 
accurate & useful

=E2=80=9CJest not installed / tests don=E2=80=99t execute / covera=
ge unverified=E2=80=9D

The report says the root trust protocol package can=E2=80=99t actually run =
its tests and that coverage claims are unverified. 

Current repo state contradicts that:

You have a root 
jest.config.js
 and test scripts in 
package.json
. 

GitHub

README explicitly advertises 
95 tests passing
 and 
95.3% coverage
, including det=
