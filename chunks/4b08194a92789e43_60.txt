=E2=80=9CNo containerization / no monitoring=E2=80=9D (for the =
overall ecosystem)

The analysis says there=E2=80=99s no containerization strategy, no Docker, =
no monitoring stack.  

But in the broader SYMBI ecosystem=
:

Synergy / Sonate docs clearly incl=
ude 
Dockerfiles
, 
docker-compose
 and an obser=
vability stack (Prometheus/Grafana). 

YCQ-Sonate already had 
docker-compose.observability.yml
 an=
d monitoring wiring. 

The trust protocol itself is still=
 a library rather than a service, so =E2=80=9Cno k8s manifests=E2=80=9D is =
fine=E2=80=94but =E2=80=9Cno containerization=E2=80=9D is too broad now.

=F0=9F=9F=A1 Partly outdated but =
directionally right

=E2=80=9CKMS incomplete / no key rotation / no tamper detection=
=E2=80=9D

The report calls out:

AWS & GCP KMS incomplete

No key rotation

No tamper detection in production =

Now:

README advertises AWS KMS, GCP KMS=
 and local KMS as implemented and tested.

=

Audit integrity tests + CLI (
audit-integrity
) exist and ar=
e wired into CI, which directly addresses =E2=80=9Cno audit trail verificat=
ion=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cno tamper detection=E2=80=9D. 

However, 
automated key rotation, vault-based secrets, and forma=
l DR/HA patterns
 are still aspirational in the checklist and not f=
ully realized across the whole ecosystem. 

So: KMS 
implementation
 is much better than the report suggests=
, but the =E2=80=9Centerprise key lifecycle & vault story=E2=80=9D is r=
ealistically still a gap.

=E2=80=9CIntegration between components is loose / no unified A=
PI gateway=E2=80=9D

The report says there=E2=80=99s no unified API gateway, inconsistent auth a=
cross components, and unclear data flow. 

You=E2=80=99ve done a lot of conce=
ptual convergence and even a

SYMBI-SYMPHONY-INTEGRATION-SUMMARY
 and related docs, but there=E2=
=80=99s still no obvious, single =E2=80=9Cdrop this in and get the full sta=
ck=E2=80=9D gateway service in the repo.

So this 
still
 feels broadly correct: the 
integration story is documented but not trivially =
turn-key
 for outsiders.

=E2=80=9CNot fully enterprise-ready yet=E2=80=9D

The core conclusion that SYMBI-Symphony is

 is still f
