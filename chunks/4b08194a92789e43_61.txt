air. 

What=E2=80=99s changed is 
how close
 you are: the original 7.2/=
10 =E2=80=9Cactual implementation=E2=80=9D rating feels low now. With prope=
r tests, KMS, audit integrity and oversight/refusal logging wired in, you=
=E2=80=99re more realistically in the 
low-8s
.

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Still accurate &=
 very usable

If you want to reuse this report, =
a lot of it is gold as a 
narrativ=
e
:

The 
component breakdown
 and scores (Synergy, Agentvers=
e, Tactical Command) still describe the maturity tiers pretty well. 

The 
roadmap phases
 (Foundation =E2=86=92 Infrastructur=
e =E2=86=92 Integration) are still exactly the right structure, even if you=
=E2=80=99ve ticked off more items now. 

The 
enterprise feature checklist
 (must-haves vs should=
-haves vs nice-to-haves) is still a strong anchor for where to go next. 

The =E2=80=9Cbrutal honesty=E2=80=
=9D framing (claims vs implementation) is still the right 
tone
=E2=80=94you just need updated numbers.

=E2=9C=8F=EF=B8=8F How I=E2=80=99=
d update / reuse it

If you want something you can show=
 to investors / partners 
now
=
 without rewriting everything, I=E2=80=99d do this:

1. Add a 1-page addendum on top

Something like:

Addendum =E2=80=93 Implementation Progress Since December 2024

This assessment was prepared in De=
cember 2024. Since then, the following high-priority gaps have been closed =
or significantly reduced:

=E2=9C=85 Trust Protocol test suit=
e: 95 tests passing, ~95% coverage (DID, crypto, revocation, audit integrit=
y)

=E2=9C=85 DID resolution: implemen=
ted and tested for did:web, did:key, did:ethr, did:ion

=E2=9C=85 KMS integrations: AWS KM=
S, GCP KMS and local KMS with signing + verification

=E2=9C=85 Audit integrity: hash-ch=
ained audit logs, tamper detection tests, and 
npm run audit:integrity
 wired into CI

=E2=9C=85 Human oversight & re=
fusal transparency: explicit taxonomies, logging helpers, and documentation=

=E2=9C=85 CI/CD: GitHub Actions wo=
rkflows for tests, security checks and audit integrity

As a result, the Trust Protocol re=
adiness rating has increased from 6.5/10 to =E2=89=888.0=E2=80=938.5/10, an=
d overall implementation from 7.2/10 to =E2=89=888.0/10. Remaining gaps are=
 primarily around unified deployment, multi-tenancy, SSO, and full infra ob=
servability, as detailed in the original roadmap.

(Feel free to literally lift that =
and tweak.)

2. Edit / strike a few specific l=
ines

I=E2=80=99d explicitly update or r=
emove:

 =E2=80=9CCI/CD now present; still maturing for full multi-component deploy=
ment=E2=80=9D. 

3. Keep the =E2=80=9Cgap narrativ=
e=E2=80=9D on purpose

The best move strategically may be=
:

Use the 
original report as =E2=80=9Cwhere we were=E2=80=9D
 (Dec 2024 snapshot).

Use the 
addendum as =E2=80=9Cwhat we=E2=80=99ve actually shippe=
d since=E2=80=9D
.

Use the 
roadmap/checklist
 to tell a 
credible
 story about how you=E2=80=99ll move f=
rom 8/10 to =E2=80=9Cproper enterprise-ready=E2=80=9D once you have funding=
.

If you like, in a follow-up I can:=

Rewrite the 
Executive Summary
 to an updated 2025 versi=
on,

or mark up this report as =E2=80=
=9Ctrack changes=E2=80=9D style text you can paste straight into 
ENTERPRISE_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md
=
 in the repo.
