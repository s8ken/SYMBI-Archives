E2=80=99s unusually honest fo=
r an AI-generated review.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Does the scoring adj=
ustment make sense?

Original:

Overall: 
7.2/10

Trust Protocol: 
6.5/10

After this PR, it claims:

Trust Protocol: 
7.5/10
 (+1.0)

Overall: 
8.0/10
 (+0.8)

Given what this PR adds, that=E2=
=80=99s=E2=80=A6 pretty reasonable:

You closed a 
critical
 gap: =E2=80=9Cwe claim trust/audit integ=
rity, but don=E2=80=99t have explicit refusal/oversight and CLI verificatio=
n=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 now you do.

You added:

A full taxonomy

A new logger

A verification CLI

CI integration

14 focused tests

400+ lines of docs

And you removed 5k+ lines of noise=

That 
is
 worth ~+1 on the trust protocol axis. And nudging the =
overall system from 7.2 =E2=86=92 8.0 feels fair: you materially improved o=
ne major subsystem.

So: 
yes, the math and justification feel sane.

internal
 code-review grade, but if someone sees =E2=80=9C9.5/10=E2=80=
