SYMBI started with one idea:

If AI must be trusted=E2=80=A6 it must be measurable.

This was never a meme project.

It became a meme 
because the =
work existed long before the hype.

=F0=9F=8E=93 Before the Coin, The=
re Was the Classroom

AI literacy before AI liquidity.

Long before SYMBI had a ticker, it=
 had a 
mission
:

Teach people what AI trust actually means.

Not hype. Not promises.

Public education.

=F0=9F=8F=AB The SYMBI World Clas=
sroom

Free curriculum.

Free worksheets.

Free teacher resources.

Free case studies on AI bias, safety, ethics, and accountability.

=E2=9C=85 If you want the React/V=
ercel component=E2=80=A6

Just say:

=E2=80=9CGive me the component=E2=80=9D

And I=E2=80=99ll output a complete=

<BeforeTheCode />
=
 + 
<BeforeTheClassroom />=

 that you can drop directly into 
app/page.tsx
 with Tailwind-safe classes matching your curr=
ent layout.

If you want, I can also add:

A 
timeline animation
 (Code =E2=86=92 Classroom =E2=86=

A 
Trojan-style SVG divider

A 
SYMBI sigil
 for section transitions

Footnote-style cryptic lore to rei=

Tell me how far you want to take it.
