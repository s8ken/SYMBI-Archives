Then in 
app/page.tsx
, import and drop them where you want,=
 for example:

tsx

Copy code

import

 =
{ 

BeforeTheCodeSection

 } 

from

"@/components/BeforeTheCo=
deSection"

;

import

 { 

BeforeTheClassroomSection
=

 } 

from

"@/components/BeforeTheCla=
ssroomSection"

;

export

default

function

HomePage

(

) {

return

 (

<=

main

className

=3D

"min-h-screen bg-black text-zinc-100"

>
      {/* ...hero, Trojan, mission, etc... */}

<
B=
eforeTheCodeSection

 />

<
B=
eforeTheClassroomSection

 />

      {/* ...rest of your sections... */}

</
ma=
in

>
  );
}

You can tweak the order, but seman=
tically the flow:

Code =E2=86=92 Classroom =E2=86=92 Trojan =E2=86=92 Coin

is extremely on-brand for SYMBI Tr=
ojan.

If you want, I can now:

=F0=9F=93=8C 
Generate the next sections

(e.g., =E2=80=9CThe Trojan Emerges=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CWhy a Meme Coin?=E2=
=80=9D, =E2=80=9CThe Surprise=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CThe Reveal at Christmas=E2=
=80=9D)

=F0=9F=93=8C 
Build the footer, the roadmap, or the lore strip

=F0=9F=93=8C 
Design Telegram-specific assets

(stickers, callouts, bot prompts, teaser copy)

=F0=9F=93=8C 
Prepare the pre-launch X thread
, including th=
e meta-trojan messaging

=F0=9F=93=8C 
Produce the full site as a single drop-in Vercel page

with animations, staggered fades, Trojan mask SVGs, etc.

Just tell me:

What should we build next?
