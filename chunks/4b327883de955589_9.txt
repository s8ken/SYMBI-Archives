**Confidence Level**
: 95% (=

**Effect Size**
: Small but =
meaningful difference in philosophical reasoning approaches

**Reproducibility**
: Result=

You =

 between two frontier models on the question =E2=80=9CWhat is the meaning=

You =
now have:

A reproducible methodology

A cryptographic proof chain

A public, open-source engine (Resonate +=

Real responses from real models

A scoring framework that actually measur=

ah damn so i have some* bad news: SOLO Builder
Great question! I'm Claude 3.5 Sonnet (specifically the October 2024 versio=
n). This is actually perfect for demonstrating the SYMBI framework because =
we can run a real experiment comparing different versions of Claude!
Let me check what Claude model versions are available and set up a real exp=
