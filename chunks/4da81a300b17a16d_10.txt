or tracking suspicious activity.

ð 
Recommended order of actions
:

Run the commands above carefully in the provided order.

If needed, copy each command individually, paste it into Terminal, and execute one at a time.

Important:

Results can be extensive. Itâs advisable to save them to a file:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo find / -xdev -mtime -0.5 -

ls

 2>/dev/null > ~/Desktop/files_modified.txt

Review the resulting text file (
files_modified.txt
) on your Desktop.

Files & Changes Observed:

Homebrew
 appears entirely 
removed or hidden
:

Commands return 
command not found
.

/usr/local/Cellar
 and 
/opt/homebrew/Cellar
 no longer exist.

No Homebrew logs available under 
~/Library/Logs/Homebrew
.

Trash

Multiple Cache Deletions
 via system process 
com.apple.deleted_helper
 at 
2025-03-07 ~16:21-16:27
:

Video, Music, Mail, iBooks, Podcasts, Messages caches targeted extensively for deletion via 
com.apple.deleted_helper

.

Suggests deliberate wiping of app-related data, possibly to remove traces of activity.

Objective-See OverSight
 alerts repeatedly deleted (
alert/banner deleted
):

Occurred at 
2025-03-07 16:27:08

.

Suggests notifications about camera/mic access attempts may have been systematically cleared, indicating potential surveillance cover-up.

ð¨ 
Suspicious Remote Activity:

Extensive, persistent 
Remote Management processes
 running without visible MDM enrollment:

Multiple subscriber processes running (ScreenSharingSubscriber, InteractiveLegacyProfilesSubscriber, PasscodeSettingsSubscriber, AccountSubscriber, SecuritySubscriber).

RemoteManagementAgent actively running.

No enrollment detected (DEP/MDM): this strongly implies a hidden, possibly malicious management profile or injection method.

Next Steps Recommended:

Step-by-step actions:

1ï¸â£ 
Save Current State of System for Evidence:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo 

log

 collect --output ~/Desktop/Security_Incident_Logs.logarchive

2ï¸â£ 
Remove Unauthorized Profiles:

bash

Copy

Edit

profiles remove -identifier system.dateandtime.force_date_time_configuration_22198806283
profiles remove -identifier passcode.settings.digital_health_restrictions.passcode.settings
profiles remove -identifier account.settings.digital_health_restrictions.account.settings

Then verify removal:

bash

Copy

Edit

profiles list

3ï¸â£ 
Check and Remove Unauthorized Launch Agents/Daemons:

Inspect each file individually from:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons

Remove any suspicious entries with:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/[filename].plist
sudo 

rm

 /Library/LaunchAgents/[filename].plist

ð¨ 
Strongly Recommended Next Step:

Given the severity and complexity, the best course is a 
clean reinstall of macOS
:

Backup essential 
personal documents only
.

Do not
 restore settings or applications automatically from backup.

Install macOS fresh via Recovery (
Cmd+R
 on boot), wiping the entire disk.

Interpreting the CacheDelete Logs:

These extensive deletions of app caches (
com.apple.deleted_helper
) usually are normal macOS housekeeping actions.

However
, the frequency and timing may be suspicious. It could indicate someone actively triggered cache purging deliberately.

âï¸ 
For continued investigation:

If you wish to keep investigating (rather than a reinstall), run these commands next for a more detailed system state check:

Check for active network connections:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

Check for rootkits or unauthorized
