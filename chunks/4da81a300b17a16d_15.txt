t as suspicious unless you explicitly recognize and authorized it.

Check the details of the suspicious account ("SJA"):

Run this command to display comprehensive details of the account:

bash

Copy

Edit

dscl . 

read

 /Users/SJA

Specifically look for:

Date of creation

Home directory path

Login shell

Account privileges

Check last login activity of all users:

To find recent logins and activities:

bash

Copy

Edit

last | grep SJA

Recommended Immediate Action:

If "SJA" was NOT created by you
 (and you donât recognize it), it is likely 
attacker-created
.

Before deleting, collect detailed evidence:

bash

Copy

Edit

dscl . 

read

 /Users/SJA > ~/Desktop/SJA_account_info.txt
sudo 

ls

 -la /Users/SJA >> ~/Desktop/SJA_account_info.txt

Save this evidence file 
SJA_account_info.txt
 securely.

After Evidence Collection:

You can safely disable and remove the suspicious account:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . delete /Users/SJA
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/SJA

(Only after evidence gathering is complete.)

â ï¸ 
Important
:

Given your plan for a complete reformat, ensure you save all evidence and document these findings for later reporting or forensic analysis.

Let me know the result of the details (
dscl . read /Users/SJA
) or if you need help interpreting the output.

SJA is me

Good to know! Since 
SJA
 is your own account, thereâs no unexpected unauthorized user account on your system. Thatâs a relief.

Next Steps: Double-Check for Any Changes to User Privileges

Even though no unknown accounts exist, an attacker 
may have modified user privileges
 or 
enabled hidden users
 for persistence. Letâs verify everything is intact.

â 
Step 1: Check for Any Hidden User Accounts

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . -list /Users IsHidden

If any account returns 
IsHidden = 1
, that means it's hidden from macOS login screens.

â 
Step 2: Check User Privileges & Admin Status

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

This will list all users who currently have 
admin privileges
. Make sure 
only
 your authorized users (
lcl
 and 
SJA
) are there.

If an unknown user appears in the admin list, remove them with:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/admin GroupMembership <username>

â 
Step 3: Check If Root Account is Enabled (It Should Be Disabled)

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

dsenableroot -s

If it responds 
"root is enabled"
, disable it immediately:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dsenableroot -d

â 
Step 4: Check for Login Hooks (Malicious Logins)

Attackers sometimes install 
login hooks
 that execute scripts when you log in.

Check for active login hooks:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow

Look for any 
LoginHook
 or 
LogoutHook
 entries. If present and suspicious, remove them with:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo defaults delete /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
sudo defaults delete /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook

Conclusion:

If everything checks out fine, your user accounts are likely untouched. Let me know if you find 
any hidden accounts, unknown admins, or active login hooks
âIâll help you clean them up. ð

I don't recall seeing a user called nobody last time we had this issue?

The 

nobody

 user is a built-in system account in macOS. However, if you 
donât recall seeing it before
, it's worth investigating to ensure it hasnât been 
modified, exploited, or used as a persistence method
.

â 
Step 1: Verify What "nobody" Is Used For

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

dscl . 

read

 /Users/nobody

This will provide details about the account, including its home directory, shell, and associated privileges.

â 
Step 2: Check If "nobody" Has Been Used to Log In

Attackers sometimes try to 
elevate
 the privileges of 
nobody
 or
