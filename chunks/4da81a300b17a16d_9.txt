nt-disabled system

ð§ 
Next Investigative Steps:

Check for Unauthorized Rootkits or Kernel Extensions (kexts):

bash

Copy

Edit

kextstat | grep -v com.apple

Check for Suspicious Login Items:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons

Inspect files and remove unauthorized items carefully.

Inspect Active Network Connections Deeply (TCP/UDP):

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P

Look specifically for unusual IPs.

Check recent file changes across system:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo find / -mtime -7 -

exec

ls

 -ld {} \; 2>/dev/null

ð¢ 
Remediation and Protection Steps:

Install advanced malware detection tools from Objective-See immediately:

KnockKnock

BlockBlock
 (already installedâverify it's running properly)

LuLu
 or 
Little Snitch
 firewall to monitor outgoing traffic.

Reinstall Homebrew for Monitoring:

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

/bin/bash -c 

"
$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

"

Monitor if it gets disabled again.

â ï¸ 
Long-Term Recommendations:

Given the complexity and persistence demonstrated, you should:

Perform a full, clean 
wipe and reinstall
 of macOS (strongly advised).

Firmware check
: Consider re-flashing macOS firmware via full macOS reinstall from recovery mode.

Router Security
: Verify Netgear device firmware, ideally factory reset, reinstall latest firmware directly from trusted vendor site.

Change ALL passwords
: Including iCloud, router admin, Apple ID, etc.

Concluding Notes:

This is a highly sophisticated compromise involving stealthy Remote Management persistence without standard MDM enrollment.

Your evidence suggests attackers actively removed/hid tools (
Homebrew
) and logs to cover their tracks.

Profile injection disguised as system profiles or "digital health" management is a major indicator of sophisticated intrusion.

Letâs systematically remediate your Mac step by step.

Which step would you like to tackle first?

I want to know all files that were either created, altered or removed during the past 12 hours

ChatGPT said:

To comprehensively list 
all files created, altered, or deleted within the past 12 hours
 on your Mac, use the following detailed Terminal commands step-by-step.

Open 
Terminal
, then run each command carefully:

ð© Step 1: List files 
created or modified
 within the last 12 hours

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo find / -xdev -mtime -0.5 -

ls

 2>/dev/null

Explanation:

sudo
 ensures elevated permissions.

find /
 searches your entire root filesystem.

-xdev
 stays within the main volume.

-mtime -0.5
 means "modified within the last 12 hours."

-ls
 lists file details.

Errors (
2>/dev/null
) are hidden for clarity.

ð© Step 2: List files specifically 
accessed
 within the past 12 hours

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo find / -xdev -atime -0.5 -

ls

 2>/dev/null

Explanation:

This checks file 
access
 times (files that were opened or read).

ð© Step 3: Check logs for files recently 
deleted

macOS doesn't keep a direct deletion log for all files. However, you can check 
Trash
 and recent system logs:

a. Check Trash for recently deleted items:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la ~/.Trash

b. Check system logs for evidence of deletions (past 12 hours):

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "deleted"'

 --last 12h

Explanation:

Looks through macOS system logs for entries explicitly mentioning "deleted."

ð© Step 4: Optional but important â check for recent 
package installations
 or 
uninstallations

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -lt /var/log/install.log | 

head

 -20

Explanation:

This command displays recent install/uninstall activities from your Macâs installation logs.

ð© Step 5: Check recent 
application launches
 (12 hours):

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "LAUNCHING"'

 --last 12h | grep 

"LAUNCHING"

Explanation:

Reveals any apps executed recentlyâuseful f
