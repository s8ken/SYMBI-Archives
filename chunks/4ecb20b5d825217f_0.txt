what's the terminal command to kill screen saring on Mac 

ChatGPT said:

To kill 
Screen Sharing
 on macOS via Terminal, use the following command:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill screensharingd

Explanation:

sudo
 â Runs the command with administrative privileges.

pkill
 â Terminates a process by name.

screensharingd
 â The process responsible for macOS Screen Sharing.

Alternative (More Forceful):

If 
pkill
 doesn't work, try:

sh

Copy

sudo killall screensharingd

Or find the process manually and kill it:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep screensharingd
sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual Process ID.)

Let me know if you need to 
fully disable Screen Sharing
 rather than just kill the process!

It looks like the terminal may have misinterpreted your command due to an unexpected input (
^[[200~
). That sequence is usually related to 
bracketed paste mode
 in some terminal emulators. Try this instead:

1. 
Re-enter the command manually

Type it carefully instead of pasting:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill screensharingd

Then press 
Enter
 and enter your 
admin password
 when prompted.

2. 
Check if the process is running

Before killing it, confirm if 
Screen Sharing
 is actually
