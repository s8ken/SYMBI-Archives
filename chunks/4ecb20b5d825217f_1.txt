running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep screensharingd

If you see a line containing 
screensharingd
, note the 
PID
 (Process ID) and kill it manually:

sh

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual number.)

3. 
Check Your Shell & File Permissions

Your second error (
zsh: permission denied: /Users/djlcl
) suggests something is wrong with your current shell session. Try:

sh

Copy

echo

$SHELL

If it prints 
/bin/zsh
, your shell is fine. Otherwise, let me know.

Also, try running:

sh

Copy

ls

 -ld ~

If it doesnât show your username as the owner, your home directory permissions may be messed up.

If the issue persists, let me know what command you ran, and I'll help troubleshoot!

Major Issue: Your User Lacks Admin Privileges

The error message:

djlcl is not in the sudoers file. This incident has been reported to the administrator.

means that 
your user (
djlcl
) does not have administrator privileges
 and 
cannot run 
sudo
 commands
. This is a serious red flag because:

You were an admin before
, but now you're locked out of 
sudo
.

The attacker may have removed your admin rights
 to prevent you from securing your system.

ð¥ 
Immediate Next Steps: Regain Admin Access

Since your system may be compromised, we need to 
regain control ASAP
. Follow these steps carefully.

ð 
Step 1: Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it on and immediately hold 
Cmd (â) + R

 until you see the 
Apple logo
 or 
macOS Utilities
 screen.

ð§ 
Step 2: Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

From the 
macOS Utilities
 screen, click 
Utilities
 (top menu).

Select 
Terminal
 to open it.

ð 
Step 3: Restore Admin Privileges

In the Terminal, type the following command 
carefully
 and press 
Enter
:

sh

Copy

resetpassword

A window will pop up. Follow these steps:

Select your user (
djlcl
) from the list.

Reset your password (even if you remember it).

Check if "Allow user to administer this computer" is enabled.

If 
checked
, you're still an admin.

If 
unchecked
, check it, then save changes.

If you 
cannot check it
, then your admin rights were fully removed.

ð  
Step 4: Manually Add Your User to Admins (If Needed)

If your admin rights were removed, do this:

Back in 
Terminal (Recovery Mode)
, type:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Volumes

This lists your drives. Note the name of your 
Macintosh HD
 (usually 
Macintosh HD
).

Run this command (replace 
Macintosh HD
 with your actual drive name if different):

sh

Copy

/Volumes/

"Macintosh HD"

/usr/bin/dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership djlcl

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

reboot

Once you log back in, try this command:

sh

Copy

groups

If you see 
admin
 in the output, you have admin rights again. Now, retry:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill screensharingd

ð¨ 
Critical Next Steps: Lock Down Your System

Since someone 
removed your admin access
, they likely 
have deep control over your Mac
. You need to:

Immediately disconnect from Wi-Fi.

Backup important files to an external drive (do NOT copy system files).

Consider fully erasing your Mac and reinstalling macOS
 to remove persistent threats.

Let me know if you need help securing your system further.
