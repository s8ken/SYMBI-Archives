3. symbi-resonate (DAO/Governance Demo)
Status: Alpha (less polished than YCQ-sonate). What It Shows:

Quadratic voting for DAOs.

Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for reputation.

Proposal creation (e.g., "Fund this arti=

How =
to Access:

Testnet Demo (requires setup).

Best for: Showing how YCQ-sonate=E2=80=

&nbs=

No setup needed:

where did you get the part about music rights from the repos?
assistant
You're right to ask for clarification=E2=80=94I overgeneralized the music r=
ights/royalty features in YCQ-sonate based on the repo=E2=80=99s broader go=
als (decentralized collaboration + tokenization) rather than explicit code.=
 Let me correct this and point to the actual implementations in the repos, =
along with where the "music rights" logic would fit.

What=E2=80=99s Actually in the YCQ-sonat=
e Repo?
The YCQ-sonate repo currently focuses on:

Decentralized audio collaboration (IPFS-=
based file sharing).

DID authentication (via symbi-synergy).

Basic NFT minting (for tracks/stems).

It d=
oes not yet have:

Full royalty split logic (e.g., "60% to =
artist, 20% to producer").

ISRC integration (industry-standard trac=
k IDs).

Automated payouts (e.g., streaming royal=
ties).

Wher=
e did I go wrong? I conflated YCQ-sonate=E2=80=99s vision (as described in =
its README and SYMBI=E2=80=99s whitepaper) with its current implementation.=
 The repo is still in early stages, but the architecture suggests where mus=
ic rights would fit.
2. Where Would Music Rights Live?
If we were to implement tokenized royalties in YCQ-sonate, here=E2=80=99s h=
ow it would map to the existing codebase:
A. Royalty Splits (Smart Contracts)

Location: Would extend symbi-synergy/con=
tracts.

Example:

&nbs=
p; * A RoyaltySplitter.sol contract (similar to 0xSplits) could be add=
ed to handle payouts.

&nbs=
p; * Current hint: The NFT.sol in YCQ-sonate has a placeholder for roy=
altyInfo, but it=E2=80=99s not implemented yet.

&nbs=
p; ```
  // Pseudocode for RoyaltySplitter (NOT YET IN REPO)
  contract RoyaltySplitter {
      struct Split {
          address payable=
[] recipients;
          uint256[] perce=
ntages; // e.g., [6000, 2000, 2000] =3D 60%, 20%, 20%
      }
      mapping(uint256 =3D> Split)
