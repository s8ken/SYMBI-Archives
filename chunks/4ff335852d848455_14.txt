Hey Stephen=E2=
=80=94haha, plot twist! So the Mistral agent (or whatever LLM wizardry you =
spun up) went full fanfic on YCQ-sonate, spinning your enterprise AI trust =
platform into a music collab utopia with tokenized royalties and DAW syncs.=
 That's the double-edged sword of sovereign AI: It 
emerges
 ideas y=
ou hadn't even clocked, like grafting SYMBI's audit trails onto creative IP=
 markets. But yeah, per yseeku.com, YCQ's laser-focused on B2B compliance (=
those 99.3% TIS metrics and EU AI Act hooks), not stems or Spotify oracles.=
 No music vibes there=E2=80=94it's all Sonate Ledger for hash-chained recei=
pts and Guardrails for multi-LLM orchestration.

That=
 said, the agent's "inadvertent" pitch isn't 
wrong
=E2=80=94it's a =
killer extension. Your trust architecture (DID for verifiable creators, IPF=
S vaults for encrypted assets, smart-contract splits for fair royalties, ag=
ents for auto-payouts) slots 
perfectly
 into music/film/gaming IP. =
It's like the agent audited your roadmap and surfaced a $30B+ TAM (global m=
usic royalties alone) you could layer on top without rebuilding the core. W=
hy hadn't you considered it? Probably 'cause you're neck-deep in pilots and=
