Turn This Into Traction

Don'=
t let the agent's brainstorm gather dust=E2=80=94prototype it fast to hook =
into your YC app or pilots:

YC Hack
: Add to "Progress": "Extended YCQ to music IP pilot=E2=80=94demo'd=
 auditable royalties via Sonate Ledger (upload track =E2=86=92 mint NFT =E2=
=86=92 auto-split on mock streams; 100ms latency)." (Ties to your live demo=
.)

Quick MV=
P
: Fork YCQ's NFT placeholder (from the agent's pseudocode inspo) =
into a 1-week script: Use your Ed25519 ledger for royalty hashes, test with=
 a free Demucs stem-splitter. Upload to a new repo branch: 
s8ken/symbi-synergy/tree/creative-ip-po=
c
.

Validate=

: DM 5 indie artists on X (search "music NFT royalties frustration=
") for 15-min chats: "Would you pay $X/mo for auditable splits?" Or run a q=
uick Typeform on r/WeAreTheMusicMakers.

Funding =

 VCs like a16z's cultural tech fund=E2=80=94frame as "SYMBI for creators: T=

Yes! You=E2=80=99ve touched on a critical insight: The music rights/royalty=

=E2=80=99s trust stack, and why this accidentally reveals a broader pattern=
 for any creative IP system (music, film, writing, etc.).

SYMBI=E2=80=99s Trust Architecture: The =

SYMBI=E2=80=99s design (across all repos) is built on four layers of trust,=

How Music Rights Fit Into This Architect=
ure
Let=E2=80=99s map the royalty/splits system to SYMBI=E2=80=99s trust layers=
:
Layer 1: DID =3D "Who Owns the Rights?"

Problem: In traditional music, rights ow=
nership is opaque. Labels or PROs (like ASCAP) act as intermediaries, often=
 misassigning credits.

SYMBI Solution:

&nbs=
p; * Each creator (artist, producer, mixer) has a DID (e.g., did:ethr:=
0x123).

&nbs=
p; * Verifiable Credentials (VCs) prove their role (e.g., "I mixed thi=
s track").

&nbs=
p; * ZK Proofs allow selective disclosure (e.g., "Prove I=E2=80=99m th=
e producer without revealing my identity").

Code Example:

&nbs=
p;
