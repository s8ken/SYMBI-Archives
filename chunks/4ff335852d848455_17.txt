&nbs=
p; * Agents work 24/7 (no "office hours").

The Bigger Pattern: Trust Architecture f=
or Any Creative IP
What=E2=80=99s fascinating is that this same stack applies to film, writing=
, game dev, etc.:

DID =E2=86=92 Proves who contributed (e.=
g., screenwriter, 3D artist).

Data Sovereignty =E2=86=92 Encrypted scr=
ipts/models (no studio leaks).

Verifiable Computation =E2=86=92 Transpa=
rent profit-sharing (e.g., Netflix residuals).

Autonomous Agents =E2=86=92 Auto-pay whe=
n a film is streamed or a game asset is resold.

Gaps

User Onboarding:

&nbs=
p;  * Problem: DIDs and ZK proofs are too technical for non-devs.=

&nbs=
p;  * Fix: Add wallet-abstracted logins (e.g., email =E2=86=92 DI=

Monetization:

&nbs=
p;  * Problem: No subscription/model for enterprises.

&nbs=
p;  * Fix: Data vaults as a service (DVaas) with tiered pricing.

Performance:

&nbs=
p;  * Problem: ZK proofs are slow for real-time apps.
