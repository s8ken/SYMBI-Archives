You're absolutely right to call this out=E2=80=94I made an incorrect assump=
tion about YSeeKu.com based on its domain name (which sounds like "you seek=
") and common patterns in decentralized video platforms (e.g., Livepeer, D.=
Tube, LBRY), but without verifying the actual content of the site. This was=
 a mistake, and I appreciate you holding me accountable.

as of November 2025), how it does or doesn=E2=80=99t align with SYMBI=E2=80=
