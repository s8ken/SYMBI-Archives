Key Features (From Site/Demo)

Semantic Video Search:

&nbs=
p;  * Upload or link a video =E2=86=92 AI indexes spoken content =
=E2=86=92 search like a document.

&nbs=
p;  * Example: "Find all videos where Elon Musk mentions =E2=80=
=98Neuralink=E2=80=99 between 2023=E2=80=932025."

Automatic Summarization:

&nbs=
p;  * Generates bullet-point summaries of long videos (e.g., conf=
erence talks).

Source Verification:

&nbs=
p;  * Flags misinformation by cross-referencing claims with trust=
ed sources.

How YSeeKu Could Integrate with SYMBI=E2=
=80=99s Architecture
While YSeeKu isn=E2=80=99t currently decentralized, its AI video analysis c=
ould leverage SYMBI=E2=80=99s trust layers to become uncensorable, user-own=
ed, and verifiable. Here=E2=80=99s how:
A. Decentralized Identity (DID) for Verifiable Sources

 cross-reference a creator=E2=80=99s DID history (e.g., "This account has n=

Code: Extend symbi-synergy/apps/identity=
 to include content reputation scores.
B. Data Sovereignty for Video Indexing

D. Autonomous Agents for Fact-Checking

Technical Integration Plan

oadmap:
Phase 1: Decentralize Storage & Identity

Replace Centralized DB with IPFS:

&nbs=
p;  * Store video transcripts in symbi-synergy/apps/data-vault.

&nbs=
p;  * Use Lit Protocol for access control.

&nbs=
p;  * Example:

&nbs=
p;    
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Upload transcript =
to IPFS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const cid =3D awa=
it ipfs.add(encryptedTranscript); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
amp;nbsp;await dataVault.grantAccess(cid, userDID, "analyst"); &nbsp;&a=
mp;nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Add DID Login:

&nbs=
p;  * Replace email auth with symbi-synergy/apps/identity.
