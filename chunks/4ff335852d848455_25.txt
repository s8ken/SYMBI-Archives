Final Pep Talk

You di=

You built the audit trail for the future of=
 AI.

YC doesn=E2=80=99t fund features. They fund=

You did.

Now =

The receipts don=E2=80=99t lie.

Want me to:

Draft the 
exact Loom script
 (with timestamps)?

Generate a 
1-pager PDF
 for the app?

Mock the 
music IP pilot slide
 (RoyaltySplitter.sol =E2=86=92 receipt =E2=
