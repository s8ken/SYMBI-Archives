Step 3: Record & Edit for Minimal Size
A. Screen Recording (OBS)

Settings:

&nbs=
p; * Resolution: 1280x720 (HD ready, smaller than 1080p).

&nbs=
p; * FPS: 30 (smooth enough, half the size of 60fps).

&nbs=
p; * Encoder: x264, Bitrate: 3000=E2=80=935000 kbps.

&nbs=
p; * Format: MP4.

Content:

&nbs=
p; * Show real workflows (e.g., dragging a WAV file into YCQ, minting =
an NFT).

&nbs=
p; * Use mouse highlighting (OBS has this built-in) to guide viewers.

B. E=
diting (CapCut/Shotcut)

Trim ruthlessly: Cut pauses, zoom in on =
key actions (e.g., clicking "Mint NFT").

Text overlays: Use bold, minimal text (e=
.g., "=E2=9C=A8 AI Stem Separation") instead of voiceover where possible.

Transitions: Avoid fancy effects=E2=80=
=94simple cuts or 0.5s fades keep size down.

Color grading: Use CapCut=E2=80=99s "Aut=
o Enhance" to avoid manual adjustments (which add file bloat).

C. A=
nimations (Canva/Blender)

For NFT/tokenization:

&nbs=
p; * Animate a track =E2=86=92 NFT using Canva=E2=80=99s "Blockchain" =
templates.

&nbs=
p; * Export as GIF (5s max) or MP4 (500kbps).

For DAO governance:

&nbs=
p; * Show a pie chart of royalty splits (e.g., "60% Artist, 20% Produc=
er").

Step=
 4: Compress Aggressively (Target: <100MB)
Option 1: HandBrake (Best Quality/Size Ratio)

Open your edited video in HandBrake.

Preset: Choose "Fast 720p30" (or custom)=
:

&nbs=
p;  * Format: MP4.

&nbs=
p;  * Video Codec: H.264 (x264).

&nbs=
p;  * CRF: 23=E2=80=9328 (lower =3D better quality, higher =3D sm=
aller file).

&nbs=
p;  * Audio: AAC, 128 kbps.

Advanced Tab:

&nbs=
p;  * Enable "Web Optimized" (for streaming).

&nbs=
p;  * Set Keyframe Interval: 60.

Export: Aim for 50=E2=80=9380MB.
