which repo has the best demo
assistant
Among the SYMBI.world repositories, YCQ-sonate currently has the most polis=
hed and accessible demo, followed by symbi-synergy (which has technical dem=
os but requires more setup). Here=E2=80=99s a breakdown:

YCQ-sonate (Best for End-User Demo)
Why?

Focused on a specific use case (music co=
llaboration) with a clear narrative.

Live demo available: YCQ.world (or testn=
et deployments).

Visual and interactive: Shows real workf=
lows (DAW integration, NFT minting, royalty splits).

How to Run Locally (For Developers)

Clone the repo:

&nbs=
p;  
 &nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/s8ken/YCQ-sonate.git &am=
p;nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd YCQ-sonate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Install dependencies:

&nbs=
p;  
 &nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;pnpm install &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Start the demo:

&nbs=
p;  
 &nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;pnpm run dev  # Frontend (Next.js) &nbsp;&nbs=
p;&nbsp;pnpm run mock:backend  # Local backend simulator &nbsp;&=
;nbsp;&nbsp;

Open 
=
http://localhost:3000
 to see:

&nbs=
p;  * A mock DAW interface (collaborative editing).

&nbs=
p;  * NFT minting flow (testnet contracts).

&nbs=
p;  * AI stem separation (runs locally via PyTorch).

Stre=
ngths of the Demo
=E2=9C=85 No blockchain knowledge needed (abstracts away complexity). =E2=
=9C=85 Interactive (users can upload their own tracks). =E2=9C=85 Visually =
engaging (animations for tokenization, AI tools). =E2=9C=85 Mobile-friendly=
 (works on phones for quick sharing).
Limitations
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Requires testnet ETH/SOL for minting (but demo provides =
faucet). =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F AI tools are client-side (no GPU needed, but sl=
ower on low-end devices).
2. symbi-synergy (Best for Technical Demo)
Why?

Core infrastructure with deep dives into=
 DID, ZK proofs, and agents.

Not as "sexy" as YCQ-sonate, but more po=
werful for developers.

How to Run Locally

Clone and install:

&nbs=
p;  
 &nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/s8ken/symbi-synergy.git =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd symbi-synergy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=
p;pnpm install &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Start the identity demo:

&nbs=
p;  
 &nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;pnpm run dev:identity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbs=
p;  * Creates a DID, signs a verifiable credential.

Test the data vault:

&nbs=
p;  
 &nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;pnpm run dev:data-vault &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;

&nbs=
p;  * Upload a file =E2=86=92 encrypt =E2=86=92 store on IPFS =E2=
=86=92 share via access control list (ACL).

Stre=
ngths of the Demo
=E2=9C=85 Shows the "plumbing" behind YCQ-sonate (e.g., how DIDs work). =E2=
=9C=85 Modular=E2=80=94can demo one feature (e.g., ZK proofs) in isolation.=
 =E2=9C=85 Developer-friendly (APIs, SDKs, and contracts are exposed).
Limitations
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Not end-user friendly (requires understanding of DIDs, I=
PFS, etc.). =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F No polished UI (focused on functionality ove=
