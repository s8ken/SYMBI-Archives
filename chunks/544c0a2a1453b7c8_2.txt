=E2=80=99s turn that into a buildable system. I=E2=80=99ll outline a compac=

Outcomes

Single corpus
 of everything (docs, PDFs, HTML/webarchives=
, TXT).

Idea graph
 linking themes, decisions, and statuses: 
captured / integrated / parked / dismiss=
ed
.

Storyboard engine
 that converts major arcs into scene pro=
mpts for image generation (e.g., Midjourney).

Provenance + timeline
 so we always know 
where
 a concept came from and 
how
 it evolved.

Sidecar pipelines:

Storyboard generator

Exporters

Ingestion & Normalization

File adapters

PDF: 
pdfminer
/
pypdf
 =E2=86=92 text + layout cues.

DOCX: 
python-docx
.

HTML/WebArchive: extract embedded H=
TML, strip scripts/styles, keep headings, dates, links.

TXT/MD: direct read.

Metadata capture

File path, created/modified, sourc=
e URL (if any), mime, language, checksum (SHA-256), size.

Normalization

Unicode cleanup, paragraph reflow,=
 heading hierarchy, quoted blocks flagged, code fences preserved.

Split into 
chunks
 (~800=E2=80=931200 tokens) with over=
lap; store section path (H1/H2 chain).

Dedup & Versioning

Exact:
 checksum equality.

Near-dup:
 MinHash (shingling) + cosine sim on embeddin=
gs; mark canonical =E2=86=92 versions.

Threading:
 if titles/first H1 match =C2=B1 date proxim=
ity, link as revisions.

Idea & Conversation Extractio=

Topic passes:

Pass 1: keyphrase & entity ext=
raction (people, projects, artifacts).

Pass 2: cluster chunks by embeddin=

Conversation reconstruction:
 order items by timestamp;=
 group by author/source when known; link Q=E2=86=92A turns if patterns like=
 =E2=80=9CQ:=E2=80=9D/=E2=80=9CA:=E2=80=9D or reply markers detected.

Decision mining:

ll=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cadopt=E2=80=9D) and modal cues; attach

Status Model (how we tell what=E2=

Heuristics + human confirm:
