i am trying to work out where the haiku on 
https://sy=
mbi.world
 come from

I'll help you find out where =
the haiku on that website come from. Let me take a look at the site.

Fetched

It looks like the page didn't load properly - I'm gettin=
g a "Children of the 404" error message, which suggests the site might be d=
own or having issues. Let me try searching for information about symbi.worl=
d and its haiku to see what I can find.
