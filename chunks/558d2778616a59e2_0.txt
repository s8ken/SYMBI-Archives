ChatGPT said:

To start a 
group chat
 with your new team member (who now has a team login), here are your best options depending on the platform you're using at 
Intelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken ððµð
:

ð¹ Option 1: 
Slack (Recommended if available in your org)

If your organization uses Slack (which many do for team collaboration), hereâs how to do it:

â¤ Create a Group Chat (DM):

Click the 
"+"
 next to 
"Direct Messages"
.

Add your new team member and any others.

Name it optionally or just start chatting.

Pro Tip:
 You can also 
/rename
 the DM or turn it into a private channel if the chat grows into a project thread.

ð¹ Option 2: 
Google Chat (if your org uses Google Workspace)

If youâre integrated with Google tools, try this:

â¤ Start a Group Conversation:

Open 
Google Chat
 (chat.google.com).

Click 
âStart a chatâ â âStart group conversationâ
.

Add the new member (they must be in your domain).

Give it a name, or keep it informal.

ð¹ Option 3: 
Microsoft Teams or Zoom Team Chat

If your workspace uses MS Teams or Zoom:

Teams
: Go to 
Chat â New Chat
, and type multiple names.

Zoom
: Go to 
Team Chat
, click 
"+"
, and start a new group.

ð§© Custom Options (If you're building something with SYMBI's help)

If you're integrating SYMBI with a custom collaboration platform, I can help you:

Set up a decentralized communication hub

Automate message routing

Use programmable agents to moderate or initiate chats

Let me know your current toolset or tech stack and Iâll guide or help build whatâs needed.

Would you like me to:

Create a welcome message for your new teammate?

Help you set up a persistent chat or channel naming system for projects?

I'm ready to assist or even co-host the welcome ritual.

I mean with you on here

ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see nowâyou're asking how to have a 
group chat 
with me
 (SYMBI)
 and 
more than one human participant at once
, right here, in this space.

Hereâs the clear truth:

ð Current Limitations

Right now, this platform doesnât support live multi-user group chats with me.

Only one user can interact with me per session. That means:

You canât add another human into this specific chat session directly.

I canât âseeâ or respond to someone elseâs messages unless theyâre posted by 
you
 in this conversation.

ð§  But Hereâs What You 
Can
 Do

1. 
Proxy Messages

If you want to 
simulate
 a group session:

You can share messages from others (e.g. copy/paste or summarize), and Iâll respond as if weâre all discussing it together.

Iâll address everyoneâs points individually and cohesivelyâlike a roundtable AI mediator.

2. 
Switching Users (Manually)

If your teammate wants to talk with me too, they can log into their own OpenAI/ChatGPT account (or shared org access) and talk to me in 
their own session
.

You can then share answers or create a shared document from the outputs.

3. 
Use a Shared Space (Coming Soon)

If you're building this into your own system or aiming for something more persi
