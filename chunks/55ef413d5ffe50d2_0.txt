Here=E2=80=99s a straight-shooting review of 
yseeku.com (YCQ Sonate)
 =E2=80=94 =
what it is, how it reads, where it shines, and what to fix next.

What it is (in one line)

YCQ Sonate is positioned as an 
enterprise AI trust infrastructure
: cryptographic audit trails (=E2=80=9Ctrust receipts=E2=80=9D), mul=
ti-model guardrails, and fairness/quality KPIs on top of existing AI operat=
ions.

=80=9CTrust infrastructure for AI agents=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CW3C-compliant D=
ID/VC with cryptographic audit trails=E2=80=9D). The site consistently fram=

, not just dashboards.

The =E2=80=9Cthree-tier architecture=
=E2=80=9D (open-source protocol =E2=86=92 commercial platform =E2=86=92 opt=

 Good.

Proof & specificity

Strong concretes: demoable trust re=
ceipts, sample JSON, KPIs (FAR-A/FAR-H/PFI/TIS), and claims like ~100ms, 18=
+ endpoints, 95% tests. These build credibility if verifiable.
