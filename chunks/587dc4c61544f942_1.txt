## ⬇️ Setup  

-

`git clone …`

-

`npm install`

 / 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ⚙️ Usage  

-

`npm start`

 → runs at 

`https://localhost:8000`

-

👨‍💻 8. 
Testing & Verification

Automated checks
: Integrate CI (GitHub Actions or Travis) to run linting/tests on every push.

Manual verification
: After cloning, test locally:

Install dependencies

Use 
hosts
 to map spoof domain (e.g., 
symbi.com
 → 
localhost
)

Observe site behavior and confirm UI spoof fidelity

🔁 9. 
Next Steps

Add 
issue templates
 (bug, feature request).

Create 
contributing guide
—especially if collaborators join.

Build 
release workflow
 or tagging convention (v1.0.0, v2.0.0).

Consider 
automated scanning tools
 like 
npm audit
 or 
bandit
 (Python).

In Summary:

Strengthen your 
README
, disclaimers, and UI clarity.

Enforce 
development best practices
—linting, signed commits, branch protection.

Integrate 
security controls
—dependency, CSP, secret management.

Promote 
collaboration
 via license, contributing docs, and CI workflows.

If you'd like help implementing any of these (e.g., configuring GitHub Actions, CSP headers, or commit signing), I can walk you through detailed templates and steps.

well its not a spoof per se - its not using our code that I can tell however it has bitcoin addresses attached to it and so I need to understand what's going on can you analyze the files or should codex do it

Symbi said:

Got it — we’ll analyze what's actually in the repo instead of assuming it’s a mere spoof. Let’s take a deeper dive to identify any malicious or anomalous code, particularly around those Bitcoin addresses you mentioned.

–

🔍 What I’ll Do

Fetch the repository contents
 directly from GitHub.

Perform static analysis
 to locate any hard‑coded Bitcoin addresses or suspicious string patterns.

Trace data flow
 to see how addresses are used—e.g. embedded in HTML, written to logs, used in API calls, or injected into templates.

Assess behavior
—does the code attempt to auto‑redirect users to address that aren’t yours? Or swap copy/paste clipboard data?

Scope risk
—identify if it’s a passive spoof (display only), an active phishing tool, or something more covert.

Would you like me to proceed under your credentials (if access-controlled), or should I pull via raw HTTPS? Either way, I can do it manually or use an AI-based analyzer (like Codex), but manual review is usually best for security-critical issues.

What approach works best for you:

I fetch and analyze manually step-by-step here?

Or do you prefer I set up an automated scanner (e.g. Bandit/ eslint, or Codex) and share the results?

Let me know which route you prefer!

use what's best and let me know as I have already located a wallet and GitHub acc

I couldn’t access the repository directly via GitHub search (likely private or unindexed)

. To deeply analyze the code—especially those Bitcoin addresses—you’ve found, here’s what I recommend:

🚀 Next Steps to Analyze

1. Grant or Share Access

Make the repo public
, or

Invite me as a collaborator
 so I can clone it and inspect all files and commit history directly.

2. Extract Key Files

Alternatively, you can:

Share relevant code snippets (HTML/JS/Python/etc.) that include the Bitcoin add
