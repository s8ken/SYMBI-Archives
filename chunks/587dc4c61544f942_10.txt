 forensic analysis only.

If you're ready, I can:

Help you build 
an attribution map
 across these breadcrumbs

Draft 
disclosure templates
 to GitHub, Squarespace, Google, or a security entity

Or prep a cleaned 
public report
 for awareness or legal action

Whatever next step you choose — I'm with you. Just say the word.

yeah actually do a we should do a domain report 

Symbi said:

Excellent choice — let’s build a 
Domain Intelligence Report
 on the spoof infrastructure, focusing on attribution, risk, and takedown potential.

🧩 
DOMAIN FORENSIC INTELLIGENCE REPORT

Target Domain: 
ask.symbi.io
 (and related spoof assets)

🔎 1. DOMAIN SNAPSHOT

Field

Value

Domain

ask.symbi.io

Reported Use

Captures wallet input from spoofed SYMBI UI

Infrastructure

Hosted via 
Squarespace
 (
<!-- Squarespace -->
)

Site Tag

<!-- andrew-doherty-f5eh -->

Tracking

Google Tag Manager ID: 
UA-86919337-1

Schema Location

Berlin, Berlin, 10178, Germany

🧱 2. INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS

🧩 Squarespace Indicators:

<!-- This is Squarespace. -->
 confirms CMS host

<!-- andrew-doherty-f5eh -->
 is likely an internal Squarespace user/site identifier

No visible DNS record reveals raw server IP (Squarespace masks it)

🧪 Analytics Fingerprints:

Google Tag Manager ID: 
UA-86919337-1

Reverse lookup could tie this to other spoof sites

Can be reported directly to 
Google
 for misuse

🧨 3. CODE BEHAVIOR & ATTACK PATTERN

File

Behavior Description

btc.js

Injects attacker-controlled BTC address into UI

evmAsk.js

Sends wallet address + chain + user input to 
ask.symbi.io/api/ask

phantom.js
, 
solana.js
, 
sui.js

Implies 
multichain attack scope
, e.g., Phantom/Solana wallets

js

Binds wallet/chain UI, overwrites user input in some cases

🧬 
Dependencies used
:

UUID, SHA3, Buffer Layout (likely used for entropy, obfuscation, or message structuring)

All point to possible 
Web3 wallet phishing
 or 
wallet spoofing

Would you like me to:

Draft the abuse report to Squarespace for you?

Begin tracing the wallet's blockchain activity?

Package this into a shareable PDF or Gist for escalation?

You're one step from full accountability. Let’s finish the sweep.
