The Moment.js locale bundle lists several contributors alongside their GitHub URLs:

 //! author : Jared Morse : https://github.com/jarcoal
 //! author : Jonathan Abourbih : https://github.com/jonbca
 //! author : Chris Gedrim : https://github.com/chrisgedrim
 //! author : Chris Cartlidge : https://github.com/chriscartlidge

 //! author : Matthew Castrillon-Madrigal : https://github.com/techdimension
 //! version : 2.30.1
 //! authors : Tim Wood, Iskren Chernev, Moment.js contributors

Placeholder or sample email addresses also appear in minified vendor files:

email@example.com
example@example.com
name@example.com
feross@feross.org
user@domain.com.

Several JavaScript files repeat the same license headers and links—for example evmAsk.js, phantom.js, solana.js, and sui.js all contain the emn178@gmail.com author email and the GitHub links above

The repository itself was cloned from GitHub:

Symbi said:

Perfect — you’ve just compiled a 
critical software provenance and code reuse profile
, which strengthens the case that:

The 
repo is a composite of open-source modules

Many 
licenses and credits were preserved
 — including author names and emails

Some authors like 
Chen, Yi-Cyuan (
emn178@gmail.com
)
, 
Feross Aboukhadijeh
, and contributors to Moment.js appear 
repeatedly
 across files

Placeholder emails suggest use of boilerplate vendor bundles

🧠 Summary: 
Code Origin & Attribution Analysis

✅ Core Insight

This codebase is 
largely assembled from open-source libraries
 — likely 
bundled from NPM or CDNs
 — and 
stitched together
 in a UI designed to harvest crypto addresses.

Sample content — not real senders

⚠️ 
None of these imply authors are involved in fraud
 — they are likely bundled in by someone assembling a composite front-end.

🧪 Pattern Observed

Identical license blocks repeated across 
btc.js
, 
evmAsk.js
, 
phantom.js
, 
sui.js
, and 
solana.js

No actual 
npm
 metadata like 
package-lock.json
 or 
node_modules
 — this was likely a 
manual bundle
 or partial archive

Suggests a 
flat static site
 with selected crypto-targeting JS

🧱 Conclusion: Not Original Code, But Possibly Weaponized Bundling

Most JS content is 
legitimate open-source

But 
combined and repurposed
 in a 
suspicious UI flow
 to:

Collect crypto wallet info

Inject attacker-controlled wallet addresses

Without transparent attribution or context = ⚠️ 
potential fraud vector

🔒 What This Means For Reporting

You now have:

Clear evidence
 the attacker did not write most code

But used it in a 
misleading context
 to collect crypto wallet data

Possible 
license violations
 if attribution is removed in parts

Reasonable grounds to report the site’s function to:

GitHub (if cloned)

Squarespace (if hosted)

Google (tracking ID)

Would you like me to now:

Draft a formal 
Code Misuse & Phishing Attribution Report
 PDF or Markdown?

Help you trace the final GitHub repo the attacker cloned from (as you hinted)?
