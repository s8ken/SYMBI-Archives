Website

Email

Company

CEO of Socket.dev
 – a security-focused platform for NPM packages and supply chain protection

Notable Work

standard.js
, 
webtorrent
, 
buffer
, 
simple-peer
, and numerous security tools

🔐 Why This Matters to Your Case

Feross 
did not write this spoof site
, nor is he likely involved in anything fraudulent here.

Instead, someone 
bundled his libraries
 (which are licensed BSD/MIT) into a malicious or misleading frontend. This is technically permitted under the license but may violate 
intent
 if:

License headers are stripped

His name or company is used to mislead

The software is used in 
crypto phishing infrastructure

🧾 Actionable Use of His Identity

If the attacker:

Leaves 
Feross’s name and website/email
 in the JS

While using the software to 
steal wallets

Then this becomes a 
false attribution scenario
 that Feross and Socket would likely want to know about

✅ Recommendation (Ethical Disclosure)

You could 
contact Feross or Socket.dev directly
 and say:

“Your code appears in a suspicious crypto website I’m investigating. It includes your license block and name, but is being used to collect wallets and redirect crypto addresses. You may want to review it in case of brand abuse.”

He’s vocal about 
software supply chain abuse
, and would likely appreciate the heads-up.

Let me know if you'd like:

A drafted email or DM for Feross or Socket

A list of exact files where his name/license appears

You're doing high-integrity forensic work — and bringing this to the attention of original devs could help root out systemic abuse.

You said:

yeah its just a private thing to let him know of the issue and maybe make a friend but the ones needing to be included in any accusation are the ones with wallet addresses

Symbi said:

Exactly — you’ve got the right mindset. 🔍

✅ Here's how to handle this with both clarity and care:

Feross: Private Ethical Heads-Up

Purpose: Inform, not accuse. Signal that his code is being reused in a way he might not want his name attached to — and build mutual trust.

Hi Feross,

I hope you don’t mind the reach-out — I’m currently analyzing a suspicious crypto site that appears to be spoofing a well-known AI project. While digging through the JS, I noticed several files retain your license headers and author tag (e.g., btc.js, evmAsk.js) from open-source projects like `buffer` and `js-sha3`.

Your work is clearly being bundled (legally), but the context is concerning — the site appears to harvest crypto wallet input and inject attacker-controlled addresses.

You're *not implicated at all*, of course — but I thought you’d want to be aware your name is embedded in what looks like phishing infrastructure.

Let me know if you'd like any of the files for verification.

Stay awesome, and thanks for everything you contribute to open source 🙏

🚨 2. 
Attack Attribution: Only Include

Focus your evidence/reporting on:

Hardcoded wallet owners
 (BTC, ETH, etc.)

Domains collecting wallet input
 (
ask.symbi.io
)

API behavior
 that logs user info

Possibly Squarespace user ID 
andrew-doherty-f5eh

They are the ones:

Actively operating infrastructure

Receiving funds

Embedding malicious UX logic

✅ DO include in reports:

Wallet addresses from 
btc.js
, 
phantom.js
, etc.

ENS names like 
chen.eth
 (if not yours)

chenbtc@gmail.com
 (if not yours)

Code patterns that inject wallet addresses deceptively
