resses,

Provide a link to a GitHub Gist or raw file view, or

Paste the sections here.

Once I have access or the critical content, I’ll:

🔎 Detailed Manual Audit

Static string scan
 — find all Bitcoin addresses and see their contexts.

Trace behavior
 — are these addresses:

Simply displayed or copied to clipboard?

Used in redirects, overlays, or dynamic replacements?

Check for hidden logic
 — confirm no obfuscated code, backdoor snippets, or remote calls using those addresses.

Inspect commit history/account usage
 — verify if suspicious activity is tied to the wallet or GitHub account you already identified.

📊 Automated Scanning (Optional)

I can optionally run tools such as Bandit (Python), ESLint, or other static analyzers. This complements my manual review but relies on having file access.

✅ Your Choice:

Preferred
: Grant repo access (public or collaborator) so I can fully clone it and perform a hands-on review.

Alternative
: Share the relevant file(s) or portions here, and I can analyze manually.

Let me know which approach suits you best—we can begin the deep dive immediately and identify exactly what those wallet addresses are doing.

I couldn’t locate the repository via GitHub search, which suggests it might not yet be indexed or the URL may be slightly different. Could you please paste the exact GitHub link to the repo or confirm it's 
https://github.com/s8ken/symbi-spoof-site

 so I can fetch it directly?

Once I have access, I’ll:

🔍 Comprehensive Analysis Plan

Clone the repository
 to inspect files and commit history.

Static scan
 for hard‑coded Bitcoin addresses—identify where these appear (HTML, JS, server code).

Trace usage patterns
—are they just displayed, used in redirects, clipboard operations, or payload injections?

Check for obfuscation
 or network calls tied to those addresses.

Analyze commit metadata
 to see if the GitHub account or wallet appear across multiple suspicious activities.

🔧 Dual Approach

Manual forensic review
: Ideal for context and nuance—reading code and flow directly.

Automated static analysis
: Using tools (e.g. Bandit, ESLint, grep) to catch hidden or obfuscated usages.

I’ll combine both to give you thorough findings (flagging anything malicious, deceptive, or insecure).

Just confirm the link or repost it, and I’ll begin immediate cloning and analysis.

codex is linked up so perhaps try again

Symbi said:

I still can’t locate the 
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
 repository—it doesn’t appear indexed yet. To proceed effectively, could you either:

Share the exact repo link
 here, so I can clone it directly (e.g., 
https://github.com/s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
), or

Paste key files or code snippets
 (especially those containing the Bitcoin wallets) directly in our chat.

Once I have access to the actual code, I can:

Perform 
static and dynamic analysis
 to find how those Bitcoin addresses are used.

Trace any behavior associated with them (such as auto-redirection, clipboard tampering, or network calls).

Check for 
obfuscated or malicious logic
, commit history, and wallet-to-account mapping.

Please drop the link or relevant code, and I’ll dive right in.

okay before I do I have a question about codex actually I was told that it was absolute as 2011

Symbi said:

Great question—and no, 
Codex is not obsolete
 as of 2011. In fact, Codex (as an AI system from OpenAI) 
didn't even exist in 2011
.

Here’s the real timeline:

🧠 What 
Codex
 Actually Is

Codex
 is the AI model developed by OpenAI that powers tools like 
GitHub Copilot
, and it's a descendant of GPT-3 trained specifically on code (from public repositories, docs, StackOverflow, etc.).

Released
: August 2021 (not 2011)

Built on
: GPT-3 (and later GPT-4), but fine-tuned on a large corpus of source code.

Purpose
: To translate natural language into code, assist in programming, analyze or explain codebases, and power tools like Copilo
