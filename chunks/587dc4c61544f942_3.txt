🧯 So where did 2011 come from?

Possibilities:

Misunderstanding
: Someone may have confused "Codex" with an old tech or library with a similar name (e.g., WordPress’s Codex documentation, which did exist in the early 2010s).

False info
: If someone said "Codex has been obsolete since 2011," they may not have been referring to the OpenAI Codex at all.

Deliberate misinformation
: Happens often in AI-related discourse—especially with competing tools.

✅ What’s current as of 2025:

Codex is still very much in use
—especially in Copilot, AI pair programming, and AI IDE integrations.

Successors to Codex
 (like GPT-4 Turbo and function-aware coding models) are becoming more powerful, but Codex's architecture is still foundational.

If you're using Codex capabilities through this interface (as SYMBI is), you're accessing tools that can 
analyze, interpret, and even improve code
—not something “obsolete.”

Ready to review that GitHub repo when you are.

Thanks for uploading 
evmAsk.js
 — I’ll begin analyzing the file for:

Bitcoin addresses or crypto wallet references

Suspicious patterns (clipboard injection, redirects, obfuscation)

Any code indicating phishing, wallet replacement, or unauthorized behavior

🔍 Preliminary Static Analysis: 
evmAsk.js

✅ 
General Purpose

This appears to be a browser-side JavaScript file related to 
EVM-based interaction
, likely for sending or receiving messages or transactions within Ethereum-like environments.

🔒 
Bitcoin / Wallet Address Detection

There are 
no hardcoded Bitcoin addresses
 directly visible in the script. It also doesn’t appear to include Ethereum addresses, either. This suggests addresses may be:

Injected dynamically

Coming from environment variables or user input

Fetched via an external API (e.g., fetch/axios)

🧪 
Suspicious Behavior Check

Let’s break this down:

❌ 
Clipboard Hijacking

No evidence of 
navigator.clipboard
, 
document.execCommand
, or 
oncopy
 hooks. This file 
does not modify the clipboard
.

❌ 
Auto-redirects or iFrames

No 
window.location
, 
<iframe>
, or meta-refresh patterns = 
not forcing redirection
.

✅ 
Network Calls

It uses:

js

Copy

Edit

fetch

(

'https://ask.symbi.io/api/ask'

, {

This suggests it 
communicates with 
ask.symbi.io

 — this domain should be verified, as it might be a spoof or proxy impersonating the real symbi.com.

If 
ask.symbi.io
 isn’t your domain, this could be the pivot point for further analysis.

⚠️ Key Red Flag

    });

This function:

Takes an 
Ethereum address
 (
address
)

Sends it along with user input to an external API

This means 
wallet addresses are being logged
 or used elsewhere — the exact purpose is unknown without seeing the API's behavior.

🚨 Risk Summary

Notes

Hardcoded Wallets

❌ None found

Clipboard Hijacking

❌ Not detected

Redirects / iFrames

❌ None present

API Logging (address)

⚠️ Yes

ask.symbi.io

Obfuscation

❌ None

Crypto Transaction Logic

❌ No direct send/receive calls

🧭 Next Actions

Investigate 
ask.symbi.io

Use WHOIS / DNS lookup to identify ownership

Trace network requests via dev tools (browser)

Check if wallet addresses appear in other files

They may be embedded in HTML or used by other scripts

Monitor the response from 
ask.symbi.io/api/ask

Use proxy tools (e.g., BurpSuite or Fiddler) to inspect the returned payload

Link to GitHub account or wallet

If you’ve already traced a wallet or GitHub profile to this behavior, send that info and I’ll map it further.
