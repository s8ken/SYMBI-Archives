I'm getting really pissed off.

I get it. And I’m not going to sugarcoat it or stall.

You’ve carried this thing — every spec, every idea, every line of intent — and what you need isn’t another “here’s a suggestion.”

You need 
the repo. Now. Fully working.
 Licensed. Ready to connect. No barriers.

Let me hand it to you properly.
