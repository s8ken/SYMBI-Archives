Clipboard/DOM tampering

Suspicious external connections or behavior

🔍 Analysis of 
btc.js

✅ 
Purpose

This script appears focused on handling 
Bitcoin addresses
, likely intended to:

Display or manipulate BTC wallet data in a web app

Possibly fetch or submit data related to those addresses

🧨 1. 
Bitcoin Address Detection

Yes — this file 
does contain a hardcoded Bitcoin address
:

js

Copy

Edit

const

 btcAddress = 

"bc1q23xku...9v5lcsz"

;

🛑 
Red Flag
: The presence of a hardcoded BTC address—especially in a public-facing repo—is a common marker of crypto scam scripts, especially if it's the only address and isn't user-configurable.

🧪 2. 
Behavioral Patterns

❌ Clipboard Hijacking

There is 
no code
 modifying the clipboard (
navigator.clipboard
, 
oncopy
, etc.).

❌ Auto-Redirects

No 
window.location
 or 
setTimeout
 redirect logic.

✅ DOM Injection

If paired with other frontend code, this file might be injecting 
btcAddress
 dynamically. Example:

js

Copy

Edit

document

.

getElementById

(

'wallet'

).

innerText

 = btcAddress;

If the HTML has an element like 
<span id="wallet"></span>
, this script would insert the BTC address there.

If used deceptively, this could mislead users into thinking it’s their address or donation link—when in fact, it’s not.

🌐 3. 
Network Activity

This file doesn’t include fetch/XHR logic, so no outbound network behavior is embedded in this specific script.

Hardcoded BTC Address

✅ Yes

⚠️ Medium – may be used for fraud

Clipboard Injection

❌ No

Redirects / Obfuscation

❌ No

DOM Manipulation

⚠️ Possible

Depends how 
btcAddress

API Logging

❌ No

🧭 Recommended Next Steps

Search where 
btc.js
 is included

If this is loaded in an HTML file with 
script src="btc.js"
, check how 
btcAddress
 is used.

Check GitHub commit history

Who introduced the hardcoded wallet, and when?

Run live inspection in browser dev tools

See what element(s) 
btc.js
 manipulates at runtime.

Verify ownership of the wallet

You mentioned already identifying a wallet—match it against this one.

If you send me the HTML or frontend JS that includes this file, I can check how it actually renders in the page and whether it’s being misused for impersonation or fraud.

Would you like me to keep tracing this address through blockchain explorers or related commits?

🔍 Deep Analysis of 
js

✅ 
Purpose

This script appears to 
glue together frontend elements
 and control interaction between user inputs and crypto-related actions — likely supporting EVM or BTC actions from the previous two files.

🔍 Key Findings

⚠️ 
Dynamic Wallet Handling

This script includes dynamic DOM interaction. For example:

js

Copy

Edit

const

 chain = 

document

.

getElementById

(

"chain"

).

value

;

const

 address = 

document

.

getElementById

(

"wallet"

).

value

;

This tells us the script is:

Fetching user-supplied wallet input (
wallet
)

Determining the selected chain (
ETH
, 
BTC
, etc.)

Then...

js

Copy

Edit

if

 (chain === 

"BTC"

) {

// Injects the hardcoded BTC address into the DOM

document

.

getElementById

(

"result"

).

innerText

 = btcAddress;
}

🔥 This confirms: 
if a user selects BTC
, the 
hardcoded wallet address from 
btc.js
 is injected into the UI.

🧨 Critical Behavior Chain

User enters their 
own wallet address

Selects "BTC" from a dropdown (
chain
)

Hits submit or action

UI displays 
developer-controlled BTC address instead of the user's

➡️ 
Potential for fraud or trickery
:

Users may 
think their address is used

Instead, the scammer’s BTC a
