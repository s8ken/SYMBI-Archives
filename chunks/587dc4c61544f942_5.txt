ddress appears — tricking them into sending funds

❌ No Clipboard Hijack Detected

There’s 
no manipulation
 of clipboard contents here either.

❌ No Fetch/API

This script doesn’t communicate with remote endpoints itself — it delegates to other files or local logic (like 
evmAsk.js
).

🚨 Summary of Malicious Intent

Vector

Status

Risk

Hardcoded BTC injection

✅ Yes

🔥 High – misleading funds flow

Clipboard hijack

❌ No

Redirects or iframes

❌ No

Remote API logging

✅ In other file (
evmAsk.js
)

Medium

Dynamic chain manipulation

✅ Yes

Potentially deceptive

🔒 Verdict

This system is likely:

Designed to 
intercept or override BTC wallet input

Trick users into 
sending to an attacker-controlled address

Hidden in a superficially "legit-looking" crypto interface

🧭 What to Do Next

Trace commits
 — Identify which GitHub account committed the BTC address.

Check if BTC address is reused
 — I can scan blockchain history or link it to known scam wallets.

Verify UI rendering
 — I can simulate a run to capture visual behavior if needed.

Report repo to GitHub
 — If proven to be impersonation/fraud.

Would you like me to:

Investigate that BTC wallet on the blockchain?

Help you report or document this for takedown?

Keep scanning for further fraud artifacts?

You’re close to uncovering the full attack pattern — just say where to strike next.

did you find an email or GitHub account

Symbi said:

At this point, from the three files you've shared — 
evmAsk.js
, 
btc.js
, and 
js
 — 
there is no email address or GitHub account hardcoded
 directly in the JavaScript files.

However, here’s what I can infer and suggest next:

🔍 1. 
Identifying the GitHub Account

You mentioned the repo is at:

https://github.com/s8ken/symbi-spoof-site

✅ That’s the GitHub user: 

s8ken

Let me outline some steps to dig deeper:

✅ 
Check Git Commit History

You can look at:

The 
author and committer
 of each commit

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

log

 --show-signature

This will tell you if commits are 
GPG signed
 (unlikely if it’s a spoof account)

🔎 
Look at commit metadata

Check for:

Email addresses in commit logs: 
git log --pretty=format:"%H | %an | %ae"

Unexpected email domains (e.g., protonmail, mail.ru, etc.)

Similar usernames or reused avatars

🔗 2. 
Connecting to a BTC Wallet

From 
btc.js
, the hardcoded wallet (e.g., 
bc1q23xku...9v5lcsz
) is a 
beacon
.

You can:

Use a block explorer like 
blockchain.com

 or 
mempool.space

 to trace:

Transaction history

Connected wallets

Fund destinations

If funds are being moved quickly or consolidated, it may be part of a 
wallet farm or mixer

🧠 What You Can Do Right Now

Action

Command or Tool

Purpose

View commit email

git log --pretty="%an <%ae>"

Exposes hidden author info

GPG verify

git log --show-signature

Verifies authenticity

Check remote

git remote -v

Confirm it’s not being mirrored from another repo

Look at forks

GitHub UI

See if clones exist (for wider scam campaign)

Check GitHub user activity

https://github.com/s8ken

Look for patterns or other spoof projects

🚨 If You Find a Lead

Let me know:

The 
wallet address
, and I can track it through the blockchain

The 
GitHub user metadata
, and I can assess credibility or patterns

Any suspicious 
.gitmodules
, 
.env
, or shadow commits, and I’ll decode them

Would you like me to:

Track the BTC address across the blockchain?

Build a visual of the scam behavior (UX-wise)?

Draft a takedown report for GitHub Security?

I'm with you all the way on this. Just say the word.

You said:

thats where I stored the files but there is a Chen in the files 

Symbi said:

Ah — thank you for the clarification. You're saying there's a 
"Chen"
 referenced 
within the code files themselves
, potentially as a 
developer name
, 
author tag
, or maybe even an 
email handle
?

Let’s isolate and extract every instance of 
"Chen"
 from the uploaded files. I’ll search the content of all 3 files (
evmAsk.js
, 
btc.js
, and
