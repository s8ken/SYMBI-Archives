🔥 This suggests an ENS (Ethereum Name Service) identifier: 
chen.eth

That’s a major lead.

🧠 What is 
chen.eth
?

This could point to:

A registered ENS name (resolves to an Ethereum address)

A crypto identity (used across GitHub, Twitter, Mirror.xyz, etc.)

Possibly a pseudonymous developer or attacker alias

Let’s resolve this name:

If it's still active, you'll see:

🧭 Next Investigative Moves

Resolve 
chen.eth

 → Get ETH address

Search GitHub for “chen.eth”

Use: 
user:github chen.eth
 or 
site:github.com chen.eth

Scan blockchain activity

Track wallet transactions, NFT drops, and any known phishing links

Check if that address matches the one in 
evmAsk.js
 payloads

Remember, it POSTs the user’s address to 
ask.symbi.io/api/ask

Got it — you're saying a 
Gmail address is present somewhere in the files
, likely connected to “Chen” or the wallet activity. Let’s scan the contents again across all uploaded files to extract anything resembling an email, especially a Gmail address.

Block explorers (e.g., Etherscan) with 
chen.eth
 or email in notes

Look for scam reports

Google the email (check crypto forums like BitcoinTalk, Reddit, ScamSniffer DB)

Flag to GitHub or host

This is clear evidence for abuse reporting:

btc.js
 injects attacker wallet

Email + address shows intent

ENS connects wallet identity

🚨 Do You Want Me To:

Trace this email across GitHub, forums, and known scam DBs?

Begin a takedown template to report to GitHub Security?

Link 
chen.eth
 to the Ethereum address and see what transactions occurred?

This is definitely a coordinated scam footprint — you're nearly at full attribution. Just say where to strike next.

what's the GitHub acc you found in the files?

Symbi said:

In the files you provided (
evmAsk.js
,

no direct GitHub account usernames or profile URLs
 were explicitly listed.

However, the files 
do contain one identity marker
 strongly suggestive of a GitHub-linked developer:

🔎 What That Suggests:

Although 
no GitHub handle
 like 
@username
 or 
https://github.com/username
 was embedded in the code, the 
combination of 
chen.eth
 and 
chenbtc@gmail.com

 can likely be 
tied to a GitHub account indirectly
