s will reveal any commits tied to that Gmail.

GitHub User Discovery Techniques
:

Search for the email using Google:

perl

Copy

Edit

site:github.com 

"chenbtc@gmail.com"

Search for “
chen.eth
” in GitHub user bios or gists:

makefile

Copy

Edit

site:github.com chen.eth

⚠️ The Repository Owner:

From your own URL (
https://github.com/s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
), we know:

Repo owner is: 

s8ken

No evidence in the file that 
chen.eth
 = 
s8ken

Possibility: s8ken cloned or mirrored code originally authored by 
chen.eth

🧭 What You Can Do Next:

Run this:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

log

 --pretty=format:

"%H %an <%ae>"

From the repo root. If any commit has:

chenbtc@gmail.com

Or 
chen.eth
 in name

Look for 
.git/config
 and 
.gitmodules
 (sometimes attackers slip metadata there).

Want me to investigate:

GitHub profiles linked to 
chen.eth
 or the email?

ENS activity from 
chen.eth
?

Blockchain wallet tied to this BTC address?

I can build a full attribution map for you. Just say the word.

no thats me 

Symbi said:

Ah — thank you for the clarification. So 

chen.eth

 and 

chenbtc@gmail.com

 are 
your identifiers
, not the attacker's.

That’s crucial.

🧠 What That Changes

Since 
those identities are yours
, and you’re the one who uploaded these files to 
your own repo (
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
)
, this confirms:

✅ The files are 
not stolen code
, but your authored or repurposed assets.

Which means...

❌ The Bitcoin address you found 
is not one you placed
?

If that BTC wallet is 
not yours
, but appears in files you authored or uploaded, 
someone may have injected it
 into your files (intentionally or via a dependency):

🧨 Possible Scenarios:

1. 
File was tampered with

If the BTC address was 
not originally yours
, someone may have edited a file (
btc.js
) in a pull request,

You said:

no for Petes sake just because its in a repo - I just stored it there after I downloaded it so you an v0 and copilot and codex can all read it  maybe write me the readme to explain and I should make it private at this stage incase its got anything easy there before I get copilot to look at it 

Symbi said:

Got it — thank you for setting that straight. You 
downloaded the code from elsewhere
, and simply 
stored it in your own repo
 (
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
) so SYMBI, Copilot, and Codex could scan and analyze it collaboratively.

Understood. Let's get you a proper README to clarify the repo's intent while covering you legally and ethically.

## 🚨 Purpose

This repo exists to:

-

 Enable static/dynamic analysis of potentially malicious or spoofed code.

-

 Investigate Bitcoin/EVM wallet injection or address replacement techniques.

-

 Track and attribute suspicious activity tied to embedded wallet addresses, ENS names, or developer identities.

-

 Collaborate with AI tools like Copilot, Codex, and SYMBI for deep inspection.

## 📦 Contents

-

`btc.js`

 — Script containing a hardcoded Bitcoin wallet address.

-

`evmAsk.js`

 — Sends user input and wallet info to an external API endpoint.

-

`js`

 — Binds chain selection to UI output (potentially deceptive address injection).

-

 Other files — Stored exactly as retrieved, 

**not modified**

, and retained for evidence and analysis only.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
