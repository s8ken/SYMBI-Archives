 Any addresses, emails, or identities found are being investigated for attribution or abuse.

## 🧠 Owner Note

This repo is maintained by 

**@s8ken**

, with the goal of leveraging AI tools (Codex, SYMBI, Copilot) to uncover threats, protect users, and trace intent behind unauthorized spoof sites.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Status: UNDER INVESTIGATION

🔒 Recommendation

Yes — 
make it private
 immediately. It may still:

Contain wallet addresses you don’t control

Be actively used in phishing or fraud

Get flagged by GitHub's abuse scanner if misunderstood

Once private, you can continue forensic work safely, and only expose sanitized analysis or metadata later.

Let me know if you want a 
takedown notice draft
, or if you’re ready for 
Copilot/CodeQL analysis
, and I’ll guide you through it.

You’re doing the right thing by sandboxing this and being transparent. Let’s finish it strong.

thank you - here is what I found from the crypto addresses

Perfect — and excellent investigative work. Here's what you've surfaced:

🧠 Summary of Your Findings

🧾 GitHub Profiles

Micah Zoltu
 (
MicahZoltu
)

Connected to the 
DarkFlorist
 GitHub org

Significant TypeScript and Ethereum-based tooling

Involved in projects like 
TheInterceptor
, 
Horswap
, and tools tied to MEV awareness, privacy (e.g. Tornado Cash SDK), and decentralized infra

DarkFlorist
 Organization

Describes themselves as “Groundskeepers of the Dark Forest” — clearly a reference to the cryptographic/metaphoric "Dark Forest" from Ethereum privacy discussions

💡 Implication

If the 
crypto addresses embedded in the spoof code
 (or POST targets like 
ask.symbi.io
) 
lead back to known projects, devs, or ecosystems
 like this, then:

Either:

The spoof code is 
misappropriating or impersonating
 reputable work

Or:

Someone connected to this network is 
experimenting in ways that weren’t disclosed or secured
 properly

You’ve done the right thing by sandboxing the code, scanning it deeply, and now attempting to 
trace authorship via wallet and repo forensics
.

⚠️ Final Consideration Before Reporting or Contact

If 
Micah Zoltu
 or the 
DarkFlorist org
 were 
knowingly involved
, they would likely:

Not embed hardcoded BTC wallets in front-facing JS

Use ENS or Tornado/zkTooling to mask on-chain intent

Attribute authorship clearly in commit history (and they haven't)

It’s more probable this is 
either impersonation
 or 
repurposing of their open-source modules
 for malicious purposes.

🧭 Suggested Next Step

Make your repo private (if not already)

Run a 
side-by-side comparison
 of code from 
TheInterceptor
, 
Horswap
, or any of Micah's pinned projects vs what’s in the spoof repo

Check if 
ask.symbi.io
 is ever referenced in any 
DarkFlorist
 or 
MicahZoltu
 repos (or via GitHub code search)

If you'd like:

I can help you 
compose a responsible disclosure message
 if this turns out to be stolen or misused open-source code

Or help you 
prepare a GitHub abuse/takedown report
 if impersonation is confirmed

You're doing precise, ethical digital forensics here — and that matters.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed from here.

Summary

The repository’s README labels this as a “fake symbi account” that exposes crypto links
The HTML page includes a Squarespace comment (<!-- This is Squarespace. --><!-- andrew-doherty-f5eh -->), showing the site is hosted on Squarespace and likely tied to a Squarespace user “andrew-doherty-f5eh”
An archive contains an offline copy of the page with structured data. It embeds a “LocalBusiness” schema listing the address “Berlin, Berlin, 10178 Germany” and uses Google Tag Manager ID UA-86919337-1
Numerous JavaScript files are included, such as btc.js, evmAsk.js, phantom.js, solana.js, and sui.js
Those scripts reference common crypto libraries; string extraction shows URLs to GitHub projects like https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid, https://github.com/emn178/js-sha3, https://gith
