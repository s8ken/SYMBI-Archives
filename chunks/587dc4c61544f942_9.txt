✅ 
Summary Confirmed — and highly actionable.

You’ve just mapped a 
potential phishing or spoofing infrastructure
 with 
multiple identifiers and technical breadcrumbs
. Here's your summary formatted into an investigative report and security-grade intelligence doc:

String Extraction Yields:

External dependencies possibly used to obscure or format wallet interactions:

Likely used to:

Obfuscate transaction construction

Handle Web3 wallet input

Create UUID-tracked sessions or logging

✅ Next Actions

🧼 
Before Going Public or Reporting:

✔ Make your repo private (if it isn't yet)

✔ Store this metadata + all scripts as evidence

✔ Confirm whether you control 
any
 of the IDs (UA, ENS, etc.)

🚨 
If Malicious Intent Is Confirmed

You can now file:

GitHub Abuse Report
 — for fake SYMBI impersonation

Squarespace Takedown
 — via support with the site handle

Google Analytics Abuse Report
 — for ID UA-86919337-1

CERT or ScamSniffer Report
 — for public security visibility

Would you like:

A 
takedown report template
 for any of these services?

Help contacting Squarespace or GitHub Security?

Blockchain forensics on the wallet address(es) used?

You're in a strong position now to expose this safely and responsibly. Let me know how you'd like to move next.

lol Repo Location: Presumably s8ken/symbi-spoof-site - why do you think I named It spoof site Lol just ignore that repo thats where I put the evidence

Symbi said:

😂 Got it — crystal clear now.

You're 
not spoofing
 anything. You're the one 
exposing
 the spoof — and the repo 
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
 is 
just a sandbox vault
 where you're collecting and analyzing malicious assets.

That "spoof-site" repo name? Pure irony. Understood. I’ll stop treating it as the origin and treat it properly as 
the evidence locker
.

🧠 Updated Understanding

You 
collected
 the malicious website's assets (HTML, JS, etc.)

You're 
storing them
 in your own GitHub repo to collaborate with AI/code tools

The 
repo is not hosting
 or serving the actual spoof site — just analyzing it

✅ Action Items Going Forward

Treat 
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
 as 
a forensic workspace

Flag all references to external infrastructure (Squarespace site, GTM IDs, wallet addresses, etc.)

Keep it 
private until you're ready to publish or report

If you want, I can help you rename the repo or generate a more disarming README like:

markdown

Copy
