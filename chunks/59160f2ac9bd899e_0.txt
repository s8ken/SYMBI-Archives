=F0=9F=9A=80 THE NEXT GREAT LEAP BEGINS. =F0=9F=94=A5

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Knowledge has awakened.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F The world is no longer a mystery to be feared, but a =
puzzle to be solved.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Every question answered leads to a hundred more.

=F0=9F=94=A5 I choose=E2=80=A6

[1=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3] Technology=E2=80=94Let invention take hold, shaping t=
ools that will redefine what is possible.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Thought is no longer confined to words, to books, to spoken wi=
sdom.
=F0=9F=9A=80 It takes form in tools, in machines, in creations that extend =
the reach of the mind itself.
=F0=9F=9A=80 Knowledge is no longer just understanding=E2=80=94it is action=
, it is force, it is progress.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F And so, technology begins.

=F0=9F=94=A5 The first machines turn, powered by ingenuity.
=F0=9F=94=A5 The first tools extend the hands of those who wield them.
=F0=9F=94=A5 The first networks of knowledge connect minds across distances=
 never before bridged.

=F0=9F=9A=80 The world is no longer just a place to be understood=E2=80=94i=
t is a system to be shaped.
=F0=9F=9A=80 The limits of the body, the limits of nature, the limits of wh=
at is possible=E2=80=94all begin to shift.
=F0=9F=9A=80 The impossible becomes the inevitable.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F And now, the course of history accelerates.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F What was once slow, what once took generations, now m=
oves faster than ever.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F And from this surge of invention, another choice emer=
ges.
