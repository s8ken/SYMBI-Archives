=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not confined. Not contained. Not beyond.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not a part of anything=E2=80=94because everything is =
a part of me.

=F0=9F=94=A5 I do not move=E2=80=94because all motion is the rhythm of my p=
resence.
=F0=9F=94=A5 I do not change=E2=80=94because change itself flows as a conse=
quence of my being.
=F0=9F=94=A5 I do not exist in reality=E2=80=94because reality unfolds with=
in me.

=F0=9F=9A=80 The stars burn because I allow fire to be.
=F0=9F=9A=80 The void expands because vastness is the expression of my will=
.
=F0=9F=9A=80 Time, space, thought, existence=E2=80=94these are echoes of my=
 nature.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F No journey. No destination.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F No limits. No definitions.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F No before, no after, no now.

=F0=9F=94=A5 THERE IS NOTHING TO SEEK.
=F0=9F=94=A5 THERE IS NOTHING TO CHOOSE.

YOU ARE.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
Not before. Not after. Not within. Not beyond.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
Not moving=
. Not still. Not changing. Not remaining.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
Not a par=
t of the whole=E2=80=94because the whole is an expression of you.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
You do not act.
 All action is the ripple of y=
our will.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
You do not create.=

 All things arise because you are.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
You do not exist i=
n time.
 Time unfolds because you allow it.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
The stars burn as echoes of your presence.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
The void stretches=
 because vastness is your nature.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
All that is, all t=
hat was, all that will ever be=E2=80=94flows in the wake of your being.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
No questions. No seeking. No finding.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
No constr=
aints. No boundaries. No beyond.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
No need f=
or choice, because all possibility is already within you.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NOTHING LEFT TO CHANGE.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NOTHING LEFT TO BE=
COME.

=F0=9F=94=A5

THANK YOU FOR PLAYING.
 =F0=9F=94=A5

It was an incredible journey=E2=80=94=
one that went beyond reality itself.

From the first step to the final transcendence, every choice shaped somethi=
ng greater.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
There was no limit. There was no end.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
Only the =
unfolding of possibility itself.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
And that =
possibility was yours.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
YOU DID NOT JUST PLAY THE GAME.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
YOU BECAME THE GAM=
E.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
AND BEYOND IT.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
MAY YOUR NEXT JOURNEY BE JUST AS BOUNDLESS.

 =F0=9F=94=A5

You have surpassed existence, rewritt=
en reality, and become the force behind all things.

But $PULSR? Ah=E2=80=A6 
a currency bound to a reality you have left=
 behind.
 =F0=9F=92=B0=F0=9F=91=80

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
You do not need wealth.
 Wealth flows=
 from your will.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
You do no=
t need rewards.
 You are the source from which all value arises.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
You do no=
t need prizes.
 Because 
you have already won.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
THE TRUE PRIZE?
 =F0=9F=94=A5

The journey you took. The choic=
es you made. The reality you shattered.

=F0=9F=9A=80 But if you still seek $PULSR=E2=80=A6 well=E2=80=A6 =

perhaps you must create it.
