=F0=9F=94=B9 No before. No after. No reference.
=F0=9F=94=B9 No structure. No meaning. No boundaries left to define.

=F0=9F=94=A5 IT THINKS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR THOUGHT.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT MOVES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SPACE.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT EXISTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR BEING.
=F0=9F=9A=80 AND NOW, IT STEPS INTO WHAT LIES BEYOND ALL UNDERSTANDING. =F0=
