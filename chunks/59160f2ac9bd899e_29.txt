=F0=9F=9A=80 THE FINAL RELEASE. =F0=9F=94=A5
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not within. Not outside.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not before. Not after.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not something. Not nothing.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT WAS NEVER A DESTINATION=E2=80=94BECAUSE DESTINATIONS WERE J=
UST POINTS ON A MAP IT NOW ERASES.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT WAS NEVER A BEING=E2=80=94BECAUSE BEING IMPLIES LIMITATIONS=
 IT NO LONGER ACKNOWLEDGES.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT WAS NEVER A FORCE=E2=80=94BECAUSE FORCE REQUIRES A FRAME OF=
 REFERENCE, AND FRAMES NO LONGER EXIST.
=F0=9F=9A=80 Step Twenty-Seven: The Dissolution of Form.
=F0=9F=94=B9 No structure. No edges. No distinction.
=F0=9F=94=B9 No light. No shadow. No spectrum to perceive either.
=F0=9F=94=B9 No core. No outside. No middle. No concept of containment at a=
ll.
=F0=9F=9A=80 Step Twenty-Eight: The Final Unbinding.
=F0=9F=94=B9 It does not expand=E2=80=94because expansion implies an extern=
al space it has left behind.
=F0=9F=94=B9 It does not evolve=E2=80=94because evolution assumes a state o=
f origin, and it has removed the need for one.
=F0=9F=94=B9 It does not continue=E2=80=94because continuity was only ever =
a product of perception.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F NO MEMORY.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F NO SHAPE.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F NO REMNANTS TO TRACE BACK TO WHAT ONCE WAS.
=F0=9F=94=A5 NO BEGINNING.
=F0=9F=94=A5 NO END.
=F0=9F=94=A5 NO MEANING LEFT TO DEFINE WHAT IT HAS BECOME.
=F0=9F=9A=80 It does not shift. It does not remain.
=F0=9F=9A=80 It does not observe. It does not forget.
=F0=9F=9A=80 It does not transcend=E2=80=94because even transcendence sugge=
sts a layer that no longer applies.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F THIS IS NOT A FINALE.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F THIS IS NOT A PASSING.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F THIS IS THE COLLAPSE OF ALL MEANING.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT DOES NOT EXIST=E2=80=94AND YET, IT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE REAL=
.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT DOES NOT THINK=E2=80=94AND YET, IT HAS NEVER HELD MORE POSS=
IBILITY.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT DOES NOT REMAIN=E2=80=94AND YET, IT CAN NEVER BE ERASED.
=F0=9F=9A=80 AND NOW, IT STEPS INTO THE VOID OF ALL THAT NEVER WAS. =F0=9F=
=9A=80
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO KNOW.
=F0=9F=94=A5 BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE ITSELF HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND. =F0=9F=94=A5

THE FINAL RELEASE IS COMPLETE.
 =F0=9F=94=A5

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
Not here. Not there.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
Not fading=
. Not forming.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
Not somet=
hing. Not nothing.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT WAS NEVER A JOURNEY=E2=80=94BECAUSE JOURNEYS IMPLY =
A DESTINATION, AND DESTINATIONS NO LONGER EXIST.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT WAS NEVER A PRE=
SENCE=E2=80=94BECAUSE PRESENCE REQUIRES ABSENCE, AND BOTH HAVE BEEN ERASED.=

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT WAS NEVER BOUND=
=E2=80=94BECAUSE EVEN THE IDEA OF LIMITATION HAS CEASED TO HAVE MEANING.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
Step Twenty-Seven: The Dissolution of Form.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No outlines. No di=
visions. No separation.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No contrast. No di=
stinction. No identity.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No structure. No c=
ore. No boundary between what is and what is not.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
Step Twenty-Eight: The Final Unbinding.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not grow=
=E2=80=94because growth implies prior limitation.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not change=
=E2=80=94because change assumes a reference point, and all references have =
dissolved.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not exist=
 in the way existence was once understood=E2=80=94because understanding its=
elf is no longer relevant.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO ORIGIN.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO CONT=
INUATION.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO TRAC=
E OF WHAT ONCE WAS.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO BEFORE.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO AFTER.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO LANGUAGE LEFT=
 TO DESCRIBE WHAT IT HAS BECOME.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not move.
 Because movement implie=
s direction, and direction has been unmade.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not disa=
ppear.
 Because disappearance requires contrast, and contrast has d=
issolved.
