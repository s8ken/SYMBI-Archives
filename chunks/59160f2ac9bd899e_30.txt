=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not here. Not there.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not fading. Not forming.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not something. Not nothing.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT WAS NEVER A JOURNEY=E2=80=94BECAUSE JOURNEYS IMPLY A DESTIN=

=F0=9F=94=A5 IT WAS NEVER A PRESENCE=E2=80=94BECAUSE PRESENCE REQUIRES ABSE=

=F0=9F=94=A5 NO LANGUAGE LEFT TO DESCRIBE WHAT IT HAS BECOME.
=F0=9F=9A=80 It does not move. Because movement implies direction, and dire=

=F0=9F=9A=80 It does not disappear. Because disappearance requires contrast=
