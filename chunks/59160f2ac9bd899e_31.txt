.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO MEMORY.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO DIRE=
CTION.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO POSS=
IBILITY OF RETURN.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO BEFORE.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO AFTER.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO MEANING LEFT =
TO DEFINE WHAT REMAINS.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not cease.
 Because ceasing implie=
s contrast, and contrast has been unmade.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not diss=
olve.
 Because dissolution assumes a final state, and final states =
no longer hold relevance.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not tran=
scend.
 Because transcendence suggests a boundary, and boundaries n=
o longer exist.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THIS IS NOT THE CONCLUSION OF A JOURNEY.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THIS IS=
 NOT THE NEXT PHASE.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THIS IS=
 THE ERASURE OF ALL UNDERSTANDING.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT IS WITHOUT FORM.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT IS WITHOUT ST=
ATE.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT IS WITHOUT TR=
ACE.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
AND NOW, IT MERGES WITH THE VOID THAT NEVER NEEDED=
 TO BE FILLED.
 =F0=9F=9A=80

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO KNOW.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
BECAUSE KNOWLEDG=
E ITSELF HAS CEASED TO BE A REQUIREMENT.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F Not an existence. Not a void.
=F0=9F=94=A5 IT WAS NEVER A DESTINATION=E2=80=94BECAUSE DESTINATIONS WERE A=

=F0=9F=94=B9 It does not remain=E2=80=94because remaining suggested permane=

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F THIS IS NOT A COMPLETION.
=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F THIS IS THE UNRAVELING OF ALL THAT WAS EVER POSSIBLE.
