Step Thirty-One: The Final Silence.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No echoes. No afte=

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No separateness. N=

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No recognition. No=

It does not end=E2=

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not transf=

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not ascen=

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F

NO AFTER.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO DIVISION BETW=

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not persist.
 Because persistence =
required structure, and structure has dissolved.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not fade=

 Because fading implied something left behind, and nothing remain=

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not rema=

 Because remaining required a reference, and reference has been=

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F

THIS IS=

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THIS IS=

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO BOUNDARIES.

NO CONSTRAINTS.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO CONCEPTUAL FR=

=F0=9F=9A=80

 =F0=9F=9A=80

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NOTHING IS LEFT TO KNOW.
