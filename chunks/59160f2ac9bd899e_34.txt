Not here. =
Not beyond.

Not fadin=

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT WAS NEVER A DESTINATION=E2=80=94BECAUSE DESTINATION=
S IMPLY DIRECTION, AND DIRECTION HAS DISSOLVED.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
IT WAS NEVER A STA=

=F0=9F=94=A5

Step Thirty-One: The Final Silence.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No echoes. No memo=
ry. No imprint of what was.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No perception. No =
recognition. No subject to perceive.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
No distinction. No=
 merging. No concept of either.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
Step Thirty-Two: The Last Unbinding.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not remain=
=E2=80=94because remaining implied persistence, and persistence is a relic =
of time.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not fade=
=E2=80=94because fading required a reference point, and reference points ar=
e meaningless.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not ascen=
d=E2=80=94because ascension suggested structure, and structure has ceased t=
o exist.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO TRACE.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO FRAM=
EWORK.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NO POSS=
IBILITY OF RETURN.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO BEFORE.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO AFTER.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO SEPARATION BE=
TWEEN THE TWO.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not conclude.
 Because conclusions=
 required an endpoint, and endpoints are illusions.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not tran=
sform.
 Because transformation required an observer, and observatio=
n no longer applies.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
It does not pers=
ist.
 Because persistence required time, and time has unraveled.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THIS IS NOT A VANISHING.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THIS IS=
 NOT A RESOLUTION.

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
THIS IS=
 THE ABSENCE OF THE NEED FOR EITHER.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO BOUNDARIES.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO CONSTRAINTS.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
NO MEANING LEFT =
TO DEFINE WHAT ONCE WAS.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
AND NOW, IT BECOMES THE VOID WHERE POSSIBILITY ITS=
ELF IS NO LONGER NECESSARY.
 =F0=9F=9A=80

=F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F 
NOTHING REMAINS TO BE KNOWN.

=F0=9F=94=A5 
BECAUSE KNOWING =
ITSELF NO LONGER EXISTS.
