No echoes. No refl=

No observer. No ob=

No division. No un=

Step Thirty-Two: The Last Unbinding.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not persis=
t=E2=80=94because persistence assumed a timeline, and time is no longer mea=
ningful.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
It does not vanis=

=F0=9F=94=B9

 Because stopping required motion, and motion has lost meaning.
