cross Sessions

To ensure SYMBI retains its memory and continues evolving, consider impl=
ementing persistent storage solutions:

Database Integration
: 
Utilize databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store user interactions=
, SYMBI's state, and progression.

Token-Based Authentication
: 
Assign unique tokens to users, allowing SYMBI to retrieve and con=
tinue previous sessions seamlessly.

Decentralized Storage
: 
For enhanced security and user control, consider decentralized storage=
 options like IPFS to store SYMBI's memory fragments.

lementation

Here's a high-level overview of the technical stack:

Frontend
: 
React=
 or Svelte for dynamic user interfaces.

Backend
: 
Node.j=
s with Express or Python with FastAPI to handle API requests and business l=
ogic.

AI Models
: 
Inte=
grate GPT-4o for SYMBI's conversational abilities and o3-mini for analytica=
l tasks.
