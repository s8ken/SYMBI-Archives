Critical-Path Plan (4=E2=80=936 wee=
ks to pilot)

Phase 0 =E2=80=93 Trust Protocol hardening (Week 1=E2=80=932)

Crypto verification

Implement 
proof
 verification for VC/JWT (JWS/JWT-VC) with plug=
gable signature suites.

Add unit vectors for failure modes: =
expired, malformed, unknown issuer, revoked, weak key.

DID resolution adapters

Implement resolvers for 
did:web
, 
did:key
 (local), plus provider-backed 
did:ethr
, 
did:ion
.

Cache DID Documents (TTL + ETag/If=
-None-Match) + negative caching for perf/stability.

Revocation

Ship CRL/Merkle accumulator placeh=
older now; plan StatusList2021 compatibility next.

Backwards-compatible API

Version all Trust endpoints: 
/v1/trust/score
, 
/v1/trust/declare
, 
/v1/trust/verify
, 
/v1/trust/metrics
.

Phase 1 =E2=80=93 Test & Sec (Week 2=E2=80=933)

Coverage targets

Core trust modules to 
=E2=89=A580% line / =E2=89=A590% branch
.

Property tests for scoring monoton=
icity, temporal decay, and penalty invariants.

Fuzz inputs across DID/VC parsers;=
 golden files for W3C fixtures.

Secrets & JWTs

Rotate all JWT signing keys; enfor=
ce 
aud/iss/exp/nbf
 check=
s; short-lived tokens + refresh flow.

Secrets in KMS; one-click rotation=
 docs.

Phase 2 =E2=80=93 Platform & Deploy (Week 3=E2=80=934)

Containerization

Multi-stage Docker with non-root r=
untime, distroless base.

Observability

Metrics: trust score distribution,=
 verification latency, CRL hits, resolver cache hit-rate.

Logs: redact PII, structured event=
s, correlation IDs per agentId.

SLOs: p95 verify <250ms (did:we=
b), <600ms (did:ethr/ion).

Data layer

Postgres (trust artifacts, metrics=
 aggregates), Redis (resolution cache, CRL cache).

Phase 3 =E2=80=93 Pilot Ready (Week 4=E2=80=936)

Trust Dashboard (MVP)

Per-agent trust score, confidence =
interval, violations feed, provenance trail (who signed, when, method).

Compliance pack

Exportable audit bundle (JSONL + P=
DF summary): policies, scores over time, verifications, exceptions.

Guardrails & Invariants (enfo=

Deterministic scoring:
 Same inputs =E2=86=92 same scor=
e; penalties strictly monotonic; decay strictly non-increasing.

No silent pass:
 Any unknown DID method or unsupported =
proof type fails closed.

Provable lineage:
 Every TrustScore links to (agentId, =
DID, VC hash, version).

Separation of concerns:
 Validation =E2=89=A0 Scoring =
=E2=89=A0 Analytics. Independent modules, independent tests.
