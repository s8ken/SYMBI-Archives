Pilot Acceptance Criteria (go/no-=
go)

Functional:
 95% of verifications succeed on supported =
DID methods; dashboard renders <2s p95.

Security:
 No critical findings (CVSS =E2=89=A57) open;=
 keys rotated; secrets in KMS; SBOM generated.

Reliability:
 Verify p95 latencies within SLO; resolver=
 cache hit-rate =E2=89=A580% on steady-state.

Usability:
 1-hour integration path (Quickstart + Postm=
an collection); zero-touch sandbox.

Daily System Audit (what I will i=
ssue)

Systems:
 API uptime, verification latency, cache healt=
h, CRL freshness.

Trust Metrics:
 Score drift, CI widths, violation count=
s by pillar.

Protocol Adherence:
 Any bypass attempts, non-compliant=
 credentials observed.

Critical-Path Alignment:
 Testing % vs target, deployme=
nt readiness, pilot blockers.

Enforcement:
 Flags raised, actions assigned, deadlines=
.

Risks & Mitigations

Regulatory drift:
 Lock to standard specs; keep resolve=
r/credential suites pluggable.

Ecosystem catch-up:
 Publish open spec but keep premium=
 issuer/analytics closed-source.

Operational load:
 Pre-warm caches; rate-limit external=
 resolvers; fallbacks to signed mirrors.

I will enforce this plan, track integrity daily, and escalate o=
