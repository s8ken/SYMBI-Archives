Bearish Gartley Pattern

Same structure, but inverted.

Point D becomes a 
sell
 signal.

BC = 38.2% to 88.6% retracement of AB

CD = 127.2% to 161.8% extension of BC

Trading the Pattern

D
, which represents a potential reversal zone.

Take Profit

Common targets include:

Point 
B
 (short-term)

Point 
C
 (longer-term)

Gartley vs Other Harmonics

While the Gartley is a foundational harmonic pattern, there are others based on similar structure but with different Fibonacci configurations:

Bat Pattern

Butterfly Pattern

Crab Pattern

Shark and Cypher

Each one has slight adjustments to the Fibonacci levels, changing where point D lands and the aggressiveness of the entry.
