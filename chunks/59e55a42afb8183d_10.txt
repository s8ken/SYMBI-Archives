gram
 via deep l=
ink: binds your device to a DID.

SYMBI attestation:
 SYMBI proves it=E2=80=99s 
our
 agent (signed bot key + on=E2=80=91cha=
in registry entry).

Mutual verification ritual:
 you sign a short =E2=80=9CFun=
ds Custody Mandate=E2=80=9D (FCM) message; SYMBI countersigns and posts a h=
ash to TON so there=E2=80=99s a public, tamper=E2=80=91evident proof of del=
egation (revocable).

2) Wallet model (no seed phrases)=

MPC 2=E2=80=91of=E2=80=913
 for your =E2=80=9CSYMBI=E2=
=80=91operable=E2=80=9D wallet:

Key A =E2=80=94 You (passkey share)
 on your device(s).=

Key B =E2=80=94 SYMBI agent
 (HSM/TEE=E2=80=91backed, p=
olicy=E2=80=91bound).

Key C =E2=80=94 Recovery/Governor
 (you can set this to=
 a trusted person, a hardware key you store offline, or a small guardian se=
t).

Policies baked into the MPC servic=
e:

Spend caps
 (per=E2=80=91tx/per=E2=80=91day).

Allowlists
 (destinations you pre=E2=80=91approve like =
Cold Vault B).

Time=E2=80=91locks
 (e.g., >X TON or >Y Jettons r=
equire a 12=E2=80=9324h delay and a second factor).

Emergency Pause
 word that freezes Key B instantly.

If you=E2=80=99d rather stay pure=
=E2=80=91TON smart=E2=80=91contract: deploy a 
TON Multisig Wallet
 with the same 2=E2=80=91of=E2=
=80=913 pattern and an admin contract that enforces spend policies. Both pa=
ths avoid mnemonics.

3) Session Keys (safe automation)=

SYMBI never uses your full authori=
ty for routine tasks.

It mints 
ephemeral session keys
 with 
scopes
 (e.g., =E2=80=9Crebalance up t=
o 50 TON among my sub=E2=80=91accounts in 24h=E2=80=9D).

Session keys auto=E2=80=91expire a=
nd can only call whitelisted contract methods.

High=E2=80=91risk actions (bridge,=
 large swaps) 
cannot
 be done=
 with session keys=E2=80=94require MPC co=E2=80=91sign + delay.

4) What you approve (intent forma=
t)

You speak human; SYMBI converts it=
 to a signed intent:

Example =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9CMove everything to Cold Vault B and =
park stables in a yield pool.=E2=80=9D

5) SYMBI=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CFunds=
 Wrangler=E2=80=9D pipeline (TON)

Discovery:
 index your TON addresses (you approve the l=
ist once).

Plan:
 build the optimal route (DEX paths, fees, cooldo=
wns), simulate results, assemble a 
manifest
.

Consent check:
 compare plan against your 
FCM policy
 + this specific intent=
; if over caps =E2=86=92 request your co=E2=80=91sign.

Execute:
 session=E2=80=91key steps first (dust sweeps,=
 small transfers); MPC=E2=80=91co=E2=80=91sign for large or sensitive steps=
.

Attest:
 publish a 
Merkle hash
 of the manifest + receipts to a SYMBI regist=
ry contract (auditable, privacy=E2=80=91preserving).

Notify:
 human=E2=80=91readable summary in Telegram.

6) =E2=80=9CCall my money to me=
=E2=80=9D flow (one command)

You say: 
=E2=80=9CCall funds to Me=E2=80=91Safe.=E2=80=9D

SYMBI:

Enumerates known sources (hot wall=
ets, sub=E2=80=91accounts).

Sweeps tiny balances =E2=86=92 mai=
n.

Swaps shitcoins/dust to TON or you=
r chosen stable.

Transfers to 
Me=E2=80=91Safe
 (your designated vault) u=
nder caps.

Posts an 
Assertion
 event on=E2=80=91chain: 
CALLHOME_OK/DELAYED/FAILED
.

If any single move exceeds thresho=
lds, it pauses at that step, pings you, and starts a

 window.
