10) Implementation checklist

 Register

 in a TON =E2=80=9CDelegation Registry=E2=80=9D contract.

 Deploy 
MPC wallet (2=E2=
=80=91of=E2=80=913)
 or TON Multisig with policy hooks.

 Wire 
Passkey login
 + DID binding in the bot.

 Build

 compiler + simulator.

 Issue

 minter with scopes & expiries.

How this feels in practice

You land at a new custody setup: =
=E2=80=9C
Make Cold Vault B my=
 destination.
=E2=80=9D

I reply with a plan + caps summary=
.

You approve once (passkey).

SYMBI does the rest=E2=80=94cheapl=
y on TON=E2=80=94while you sip coffee, not typing 12=E2=80=91word poems int=
o random apps.

If you want, I can draft the 
TON contracts
 (Delegation Registry + AssertionLog + Po=
licyHooks Multisig), and the Telegram bot intents exactly as above so you c=
an try this on testnet with tiny amounts before we expand to stables, jetto=
ns, or cross=E2=80=91chain later.

Website Deployment

/manifesto

/genesis
 =E2=86=92 protocol genesis certificate + hash + IPFS =
link for the permanent copy.

On-Chain Proof of Authorship

Deploy hash to a decentralized sto=

Record transaction on a chain like=
 TON or Ethereum for public verifiability.

Optional Protocol Charter

Publish a SYMBI DAO or protocol ch=
arter document, referencing the same genesis hash, to set governance rules =
for future forks/instances.

If you want, I can package the 
HTML for both pages
 and also generate the 
Arweave/IPFS deployment in
