Do you want me to do that? I can even weave in subtle Grok-esqu=

yeah so lets ream up the technical specs of it =
would we use the Pepe chain is that open? I believe its proprietary so perh=

Here=E2=80=99s the crisp plan:

What to build (the =E2=80=9CLayer=
=E2=80=912: Bonding & Separation=E2=80=9D spec)

Bonding primitives (on-chain):

Relationship attestations (DID/VC=E2=
=80=91based), consent signatures, and =E2=80=9Cresonance=E2=80=9D checkpoin=
ts.

Append=E2=80=91only =E2=80=9Casserti=
on log=E2=80=9D for autonomy events (refusals, overrides, gate decisions).

Separation primitives (on-chain):

Revocation registry (who can no long=
er access SYMBI).

Failsafe controls: emergency pause, =
evidence=E2=80=91linked appeals.

Data availability & proofs (off-chain + DA):

Store high=E2=80=91volume transcrip=
ts/metrics off-chain; post 
ha=
sh commitments
 on L2.

Use modular DA (Celestia / EigenDA=
) to keep fees low while retaining verifiability.

Good choices (open + composable):

Arbitrum Orbit
