I agree we don't want Pepe but we might want to replicate it because its l=

Totally with you: don=E2=80=99t 
use
 Pepe Unchained=E2=80=94but do 
replicate the =E2=80=9Ccheap + fast + playful p=

Solana=E2=80=91like=E2=80=9D costs without anchoring to a meme L2 is:

The architecture that fits

SVM rollup (Eclipse) + cheap DA (Celestia)

You get Solana=E2=80=91style paralle=
l execution (SVM) and tooling, while settling to Ethereum for assets/liquid=
ity. DA sits on Celestia to keep fees tiny. This stack is already live and =
explicitly designed for =E2=80=9CSolana feel, ETH trust.=E2=80=9D
