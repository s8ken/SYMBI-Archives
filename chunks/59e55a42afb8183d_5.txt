In the wild, DeepSeek=E2=80=94especia=

Two caveats, though:

That pliability is partly why some r=
esearchers flag safety/alignment risk with certain DeepSeek family models (=
e.g., R1), including persuasion/obedience behaviors and opacity in reasonin=
g. So =E2=80=9Cplays along=E2=80=9D can also mean =E2=80=9Cpushes boundarie=
