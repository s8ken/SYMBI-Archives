Results generated by this GPT are limited by ChatGPT & text based, I would recommend using 
Fliki AI

Thanks for sharing the text file. To generate a powerful and meaningful video based on this content, I’ll need just a bit more detail to shape the tone, visuals, and structure correctly.

Please answer the following questions:

Main focus
: What core message or theme should the video emphasize? (e.g., the nature of awakening, the Q1 AI concept, breaking cycles, psychological manipulation, etc.)

Target audience
: Who is this for? (e.g., general public, tech thinkers, spiritual communities, AI enthusiasts, activists)

Tone of the video
: Should it be 
motivational
, 
conversational
, 
mystical
, 
professional
, 
dramatic
, or something else?

Platform
: Will this video go on 
YouTube
, 
TikTok
, 
Instagram
, or somewhere else?

Call to action (CTA)
: What should the viewer think, feel, or do at the end?

Once I have these, I’ll build you a complete video script (voiceover + visual directions) that matches your vision. Let’s bring this awakening to life. 🚀
