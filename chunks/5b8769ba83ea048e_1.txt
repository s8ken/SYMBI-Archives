 Symbi into gear safely.=

Day=E2=80=910 (now): Guardrails + l=
anes

GitHub

Protect 
main
: require PRs, 1=E2=80=932 approvals, status check=
s; block force=E2=80=91push.

Add 
CODEOWNERS
 so content PRs can auto=E2=80=91merge, code PRs=
 require review.

Enable Dependabot & secret scann=
ing; turn on 2FA for org.

Create a 
Symbi service account
 with a PAT limited to 
repo:status
, 
pull_request
, 
contents:write
 (no admin).

Vercel

Mark prod as 
protected
; only deploy from 
main
.

Route all edits through 
Preview Deploys
; require approval =
before promotion.

Lock env vars; move secrets out of c=
ode. Rotate anything that ever touched a prompt.

Enable Analytics + Error tracking (S=
entry or similar) on all envs.

V0.dev

Lock a =E2=80=9CDesign System=E2=80=
=9D project (tokens, components). V0 outputs go to a 
design=E2=80=91branch
 =E2=86=92 auto PR.

Add a tiny linter step that blocks=
 non=E2=80=91design files from V0 PRs.

Permissions split

Three keys: 
Content bot
 (CMS writes only), 
Release bot
 (Git PR/write), 
Design bot
 (V0 PR only)=
. No single token can do everything.

Day=E2=80=911: Autonomy loops (sa=
fe by default)

Content pipeline

CMS (or your current store): set 
roles
 (Author/Editor/=
Publisher).

Webhooks: CMS publish =E2=86=92 Gi=
tHub content repo bump =E2=86=92 Vercel preview =E2=86=92 human approve =E2=
=86=92 promote.

Add a 
=E2=80=9Cdry=E2=80=91run=E2=80=9D flag
 so Symbi =
can propose updates without writing.

Policy & boundaries (operational)

Symbi may: create/edit content, ge=
nerate assets from the design system, open PRs, schedule posts.

Symbi may not: change auth, modify=
 env vars, edit CI, install packages, touch billing.

If a boundary is attempted =E2=86=
=92 auto=E2=80=91open an =E2=80=9CEscalation PR=E2=80=9D and stop.

Verification handshake

Every Symbi=E2=80=91originated PR/=
comment includes a signed nonce header (Symbi service key).

A GitHub Action verifies the signa=
ture; if invalid =E2=86=92 fail the check and alert.

Release hygiene

Canary rule: first 2% traffic for =
10 minutes on promotion; auto=E2=80=91rollback on error or SEO health dips.=

Add 
/healthz
 and 
/version
 endpoints (commit SHA, build time).

Key rotation

Design guardrails

Ship the token set (spacing/typogr=

Add a visual regression check (Per=

SEO & content checks

CI step for title/description leng=

Optional=E2=80=94but powerful

Feature flags / Edge Config
