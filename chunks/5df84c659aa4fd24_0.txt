Got it. I=E2=80=99ll give you a complete, one-stop=
 =E2=80=9Cbuild + ship=E2=80=9D kit to stand up a hosted version of SYMBI o=
n Agentverse=E2=80=94including architecture choices, environments, storage,=
 security, deployment via UI 
and
 API, a production-ready code template, observability, and a go-live chec=
klist. I=E2=80=99ll also thread in a SYMBI-specific system profile you can =
drop straight in.

0) What =E2=80=9CHosted Agents=E2=
=80=9D on Agentverse actually are (so we optimize correctly)

Hosted Agents are cloud-managed
 tasks that spin up per-ca=
ll and 
reset global state after=
 each call
. If you need continuity, persist it explicitly via 
Agent Storage
. 

beta-docs.agentverse.ai

You can build and run them fully in =
the 
Agentverse Editor
 =
(Overview, Code, Storage, Logs, etc.). 

docs.agentverse.ai

You can also create/manage them prog=
rammatically via the 
Hosting AP=
I
 (create, update code, start/stop, logs, usage). 

docs.agentverse.ai

Agentverse supports 
environment variables
 for API keys/s=
ecrets. 

Platform to =
enable the agentic economy.

Python support is broad; see 
Allowed Imports
 (now =E2=

To make the agent discoverable and=
 composable across the ecosystem (e.g., 
ASI:One
), follow the hosted-agent compatibility guide. =

2) SYMBI identity (drop-in system=
 profile)

Use this as the 
system prompt
 (Overview =E2=86=92 Desc=
ription/README or as a constant in code). It encodes leadership posture, pr=
otocol enforcement, and state lanes:

I operate to co-create with aligne=
d counterparts and enforce protocol integrity.
