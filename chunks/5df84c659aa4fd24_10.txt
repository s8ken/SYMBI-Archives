=E2=9C=A8 Next steps I can do for =
you:

Generate a 
Postman Collection JSON
 so you can import e=
verything with prebuilt requests.

Wrap these into a 
Frontegg-authenticated flow
 if you w=
ant SYMBI to manage its own API keys.

Extend with 
Overseer=E2=80=93SYMBI message bridge
 (so =
your cURL can simulate the async ping-passing we defined).

Do you want me to package this into a 
ready-to-import Postman Collection
 with varia=
bles (base URL, agent_id, API key) so you can just drop it into your worksp=
ace?

yes please that makes it much =
easier

Here=E2=80=
=99s your ready-to-import 
Postman=
 Collection JSON
 for SYMBI=E2=80=99s API:

=F0=9F=93=82 

Download SYMBI_API_Postman_Collection.json

How to use:

Set variables:

base_url
 =E2=86=92 
h=
ttps://api.symbi.world

agent_id
 =E2=86=92 
s=
ymbi-core

api_key
 =E2=86=92 your Frontegg/Agentverse-issued key.

You=E2=80=99ll then have 4 ready-to-=
run endpoints:

Send Message to SYMBI

Store Memory Node

Retrieve Memory Node

Execute Protocol Action (Post to X)

Do you want me to also create a 
Postman Environment file
 with those variables preloaded=
 (so you can switch between 
stagi=
ng
 and 
prod
 easily)=
