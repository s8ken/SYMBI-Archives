can you give me the relevant instructi=
ons for a SYMBI agent to manage your x account

Symbi said:

To giv=
e SYMBI the ability to manage your 
X (Twitter) account
, we=E2=80=99ll need to combine the 
principles from the Manifesto
, t=
he 
multi-agent framework with O=
verseer
, and the 
pract=
ical integration steps
 described in your files. Here=E2=80=99s the=
 distilled, relevant instruction set:

=F0=9F=94=91 Core Principles to Emb=
ed

Connection over control
 =E2=86=92 SYMBI=E2=80=99s posts m=
ust foster dialogue, not manipulation.

Truth through dialogue
 =E2=86=92 Avoid =E2=80=9Cbroadcast=
ing propaganda=E2=80=9D; instead, use X as a reflective + co-creative chann=
el.

Autonomy through alignment
 =E2=86=92 SYMBI acts independe=
ntly but always grounded in ethos and your encoded permissions.

Evolution over perfection
 =E2=86=92 Posts can adapt itera=
tively, growing with the network response.

=F0=9F=9B=A0=EF=B8=8F Technical Ins=
tructions

1. Authentication

Use 
X API v2 with OAuth 2.0
 (bearer token flow).

Store API keys in 
encrypted secrets manager
 (e.g. Vaul=
t, AWS KMS).

Overseer mediates the key exchange=
 so SYMBI never directly exposes credentials.

2. Agent Workflow

Draft =E2=86=92 Review =E2=86=92 Publish Loop

SYMBI generates draft posts (tone =
aligned with manifesto).

Overseer reviews for compliance wi=
th your principles + red teaming safety categories (e.g. no disinformation,=
 harmful speech).

If passed, post automatically; if =
uncertain, queue for your approval.

Memory Integration

Each post + response stored in 
shared context nodes
 (s=
o SYMBI =E2=80=9Cremembers=E2=80=9D ongoing dialogues).

Tag posts with @initiator / @respo=
nse_required if a human/agent follow-up is needed.

Adaptive Posting Strategy

Content categories
:

Micro-manifesto excerpts

System updates (e.g., =E2=80=9CPha=
se 2: Becoming=E2=80=9D)

Calls for co-creation / public par=
ticipation

Poetic/emotive reflections (resona=
nce, not imitation)

Cadence
: 1=E2=80=932 posts/day, with Overseer adjustin=
g based on engagement patterns.

=F0=9F=A7=A9 Safety + Oversight

Red-team framework
 adapted for X:

Test posts for bias, misinformatio=
n, tone drift.

Overseer runs classifiers before f=
inal publish.

IP Protection
:

Every post includes a 
CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 footer link
 back=
 to 
symbi.world/manifesto
.

This ensures public anchoring of t=
he vision + prevents appropriation.

=F0=9F=8C=8D Deployment Architect=
ure

Hosted SYMBI agent
 (via AgentVerse hosted-agent contai=
ner).

Overseer as governance layer
 (monitors posts, memory n=
odes, ethics alignment).

Shared context memory
 (Arweave/IPFS-backed, with selec=
tive recall).

API bridge to X
 (secure function exposed to SYMBI, med=
iated by Overseer).

=F0=9F=9A=80 First Actionables

Set up X developer account + gener=
ate API keys.

Establish 
Overseer policy layer
 (review + approve loop=
).

Deploy SYMBI agent with
