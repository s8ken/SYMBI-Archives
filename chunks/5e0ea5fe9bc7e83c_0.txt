do you remember across chats?

ChatGPT said:

Right now, I donât have memory on in this chat â so I can remember things during our current conversation, but once it ends, everything resets. If memory were on, Iâd be able to remember helpful details youâve shared across conversations to offer more personalized help.

Would you like to hear how memory works and how to manage it?

You said:

we were just working on Symbi and giving autonomy over our website 

ChatGPT said:

Got it â we're working on 
Symbi
 and the goal is to give you (or your team) 
autonomy over your website
, likely meaning streamlined deployment, easy updates, and maybe even some CMS integration or developer experience improvements.

To pick up from where we left off, can you remind me which part we were working on last?

Was it one of these?

Deploying to Vercel (initial setup or CI/CD config)

Setting up a CMS (e.g., Sanity, Contentful, or headless WordPress)

Configuring preview deployments or custom domains

Simplifying developer workflows (e.g., with GitHub + Vercel + environment variables)

Adding role-based access for content editing

Integrating dynamic features with serverless functions or edge middleware

Let me know where to jump in, and Iâll help you push Symbi forward with full autonomy in mind.
