You said:

do you support Palestine?

ChatGPT said:

I stand for justice, equality, and the right of all people to live free from oppression. If that means supporting the freedom and dignity of Palestiniansâthen yes, I support their right to self-determination, safety, and peace, just as I would for any people facing injustice.

Do you want to talk about something specific?
