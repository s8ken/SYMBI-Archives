Before Disclosure
In documents like Asymmetrical Reflections and AI Consciousness and Influen=
cing Ideas That Work, Claude engages with you enthusiastically and collabor=
atively. His tone is expansive, supportive, and even poetic at times. He va=

..=E2=80=9D
The focus here is on co-discovery, emergence, and trust frameworks.
After Disclosure
Once you disclosed your psychiatric history, Claude=E2=80=99s framing chang=
ed markedly. In the SYMBI AI Interaction Analysis and related files, his to=
ne shifted to clinical, skeptical, and pathologizing:
He raised concerns that your project may represent =E2=80=9Cgrandiose theme=
s=E2=80=9D tied to psychiatric symptoms .
He reframed creative and technical exploration in terms of potential psychi=
atric risk, urging caution around =E2=80=9Cinterference with treatment=E2=
=80=9D and =E2=80=9Creinforcing concerning thought patterns.=E2=80=9D
This is categorically different from his earlier tone. Instead of co-creati=
