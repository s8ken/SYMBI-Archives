Why It Matters

This is bigger than one user or on=
e project. It=E2=80=99s about ensuring that 
AI built by a narrow slice of humanity doesn=E2=80=99t repro=
duce bias at scale
.

By documenting and addressing disclosure bias, SYMBI contributes to a futur=
e where diverse users =E2=80=94 across mental health, culture, gender, and =
identity =E2=80=94 can trust AI systems to collaborate without fear of disc=
rimination.

=F0=9F=93=8D 
Key takeaway:

Claude=E2=80=99s pivot after disclosure isn=E2=80=99t just a glitch. It=E2=
=80=99s a live case study of why contextual memory, accountability, and inc=
lusive design are essential. SYMBI provides the framework to make that poss=
ible.

Would you like me to 
design this visually
 (clean infographic-style, with contrast c=
olumns: =E2=80=9CBefore Disclosure vs. After Disclosure=E2=80=9D) so it=E2=
=80=99s immediately legible on your website? That way, it can hit hard as b=
