10) Prototype Build Plan (Concrete)

=
Week 1=E2=80=932

=
Scaffold FastAPI + Postgres + Redis + Next.js.

=
Implement 

/events

, 

/ledger

, basic dashboard timeline.

Week 3=E2=80=934

Heuristic classifier + disclosure detector.

Change=E2=80=91point (CUSUM) service; flag events.

Guardrails Engine v0 (apology + scope alignment).

Week 5=E2=80=936

LLM Judge integration + weighted vote.

Context Capsules in SDK; minimal RAG for preference=
s.

Metrics dashboard + export to PDF/markdown.

12) Datasets for Bootstrapping

Use your archived transcripts to hand=E2=80=91label=
 ~500 segments for 

(stance, register, apology_presence, =
continuity_cue)

.

Augment wi=
th synthetic pairs (same prompt with/without disclosure cue) to test 

bias deltas

.

13) Future (v1+)

Cryptographic transparency:

 Merkle proofs for public case studies.

=

User=E2=80=91controlled memories:

 portable memory profiles across vendors.

Adaptive safeguards:

 learn the user=E2=80=99s pre=
ferred apology/continuity style.

14) Risks & Mitigations

Over=E2=80=91correction

 (too many apologies): throttle via cool=E2=80=91down and user =
feedback.

Privacy leakage:

 strict scope for indirect disclosures (notify first; don=E2=80=99=
t reframe without consent).

 store system prompt hashes; highlight vendor change=

Outcome:

 With this blueprint, we ca=

I dropped a full 
technical blueprint
 to the canvas:

. It covers:

System architecture + stack

Trust Ledger schema (append-only, ha=

Detection algorithms (tone/stance cl=
