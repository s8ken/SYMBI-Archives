Developer Guidelines and Motivations
These tonal shifts are rooted in the design guidelines set by AI developers=
 to handle high-risk conversations responsibly. Both Anthropic and OpenAI h=

 in mental health contexts:
Avoiding Reinforcement of Delusions: One major goal is to prevent the AI fr=
om unwittingly validating a user=E2=80=99s delusional or harmful beliefs. E=

ideas, creating an =E2=80=9Cecho chamber=E2=80=9D effect

 was seen as =E2=80=9Cdangerous or inappropriate=E2=80=9D because it could =
escalate the user=E2=80=99s detachment from reality
