nt installations.

Step 2: Review Homebrew Installation Logs for Activity History

Check Homebrew's logs:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/Library/Logs/Homebrew/*.

log

Reviewing these logs may reveal exactly what was installed, when, and potentially by whom.

Step 3: Review Shell History for Suspicious Commands

Check your shell history for unusual activities:

bash

Copy

Edit

history

 | grep brew

history

 | grep curl

history

 | grep git

This helps identify commands potentially used by attackers.

Step 4: Verify Homebrew Configuration and Custom Taps

Run this to list custom sources ("taps"):

bash

Copy

Edit

brew tap

Attackers may add malicious taps for persistence.

Step 5: Check for Suspicious Services Managed by Homebrew

Identify Homebrew-managed services:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew services list

This checks for hidden services potentially giving attackers remote control or data exfiltration capabilities.

Step 6: Check Cron Jobs or Launch Agents for Persistence

Check cron jobs:

bash

Copy

Edit

crontab -l

And launch agents or daemons (common attacker persistence):

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents

ls

 /Library/LaunchDaemons

Inspect contents of suspicious 
.plist
 files by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<suspicious-file>.plist

Step 7: Scan for Recently Modified or Created Files in System Directories

Search for suspicious file activity in important folders:

bash

Copy

Edit

find /usr/local/bin /opt/homebrew/bin -mtime -30 -

exec

ls

 -ld {} \;

This shows files modified within the past 30 days.

Next Steps:

Perform these checks carefully and provide any suspicious findings here. I'll guide you through the analysis and removal steps based on what we find.
