ents could indicate persistent processes. We need to analyze their contents.

Next Steps:

Check for Homebrew remnants

find
 / 
-name

"*homebrew*"

2
>/dev/null

Inspect suspicious plist files

cat
 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist

cat
 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist

Investigate AirPlay activity

log show 
--predicate

'process CONTAINS[c] "AirPlay"'

--last
 7d

User: There were 2 network drives they were accessing.

Assistant: Let's find out what they were accessing and whether the attacker is still here.

Step 1: Identify Mounted Network Drives

mount | 
grep

"//"

df 
-h
 | 
grep

"//"

Step 2: List Recently Accessed Files

find
 /Volumes/<NetworkDriveName> 
-type
 f 
-atime

-7

-exec

ls

-ltu
 {} \; | head 
-20

Step 3: Check Active Network Connections

smbutil statshares 
-a

lsof 
-nPi
 TCP | 
grep

-i
 smb

lsof 
-nPi
 TCP | 
grep

-i
 afp

Step 4: Unmount Unauthorized Network Drives

diskutil unmount force /Volumes/<SuspiciousDrive>

User: Says it wants access to folders on my desktop.

Assistant: This is a 

security red flag

. Let’s check who’s trying to access it.

Step 1: Identify the Requesting Process

log show 
--predicate

'subsystem contains "TCC" AND eventMessage contains[c] "Desktop"'

--last
 30m | 
grep

-i

"access"

Step 2: Check Permissions Already Granted

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 
'SELECT * FROM access'
 | 
grep
 Desktop

Step 3: List Files Currently Accessed on Desktop

lsof +D ~/Desktop

User: It's the mount / grep.

Assistant: This means the network drive is likely still present, but we need more details. Let's see what's currently mounted:

mount | 
grep

"//"

User: There are multiple Remote Management processes running.

Assistant: This strongly suggests unauthorized remote access or MDM (Mobile Device Management) control.

Immediate Actions:

Check for Unauthorized MDM Profiles

profiles status 
-type
 enrollment

profiles list

Check Active Remote Management & Screen Sharing

sudo
 launchctl list | 
grep

-i
 screensharing

sudo
 launchctl list | 
grep

-i
 remotemanagement

Disable Remote Management

sudo
 /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart 
-deactivate

-stop

Disable Screen Sharing

sudo
 launchctl disable system/com.apple.screensharing

User: Today, we need a high-level summary. Focus on:

Who they are

Where they are from

What they were trying to do

What they accessed

What they left behind

If they are still here

Any identifiers

Assistant: Understood. Let’s collect the final evidence quickly and summarize our findings.

Final Steps:

Check Active Network Connections for Attacker IPs

lsof 
-i

-P
 | 
grep
 ESTABLISHED

Check MDM Logs for Attacker Activity

log show 
--predicate

'eventMessage contains "MDM"'

--last
 7d

Find Any Hidden User Accounts They Created

dscl . list /Users

Check for Any Rogue Startup Items

ls

-la
 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

ls

-la
 /Library/LaunchDaemons/
