rminal immediately after seeing the request:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem contains "TCC" AND eventMessage contains[c] "Desktop"'

 --last 30m | grep -i 

"access"

This will explicitly reveal recent requests by apps to access Desktop (TCC handles permissions).

✅ 
Step 3: Check Permissions You've Already Granted

Run to check existing permissions:

bash

Copy

Edit

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

This will reveal apps already given access to critical locations like Desktop or Documents.

✅ 
Step 3: Immediately Deny Access If Uncertain

If you don’t clearly recognize the app, 
deny the request
 immediately to limit further exposure.

✅ 
Step 4: Investigate Active Connections and Files Opened on Desktop

Check active file access on Desktop:

bash

Copy

Edit

lsof +D ~/Desktop

This lists active processes accessing files on your desktop.

✅ 
Step 4: Check for Suspicious Processes

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -Ei 

'ssh|smb|vnc|remote|screensharing|anydesk|teamviewer'

Look for unexpected remote or suspicious processes.

✅ 
Next Steps:

Please share the exact name of the app prompting the permission.

Also, share any suspicious outputs from above steps.

We will quickly confirm the situation and proceed carefully to shut down this unauthorized access.
