These findings indicate 
active Remote Management and Screen Sharing components
 running on your Mac, along with 
frequent permission prompts
, strongly suggesting that your Mac is currently under a 
remote management profile or remote monitoring scenario
.

🚨 
Critical Observations:

Multiple Remote Management processes
:

RemoteManagementAgent

ScreenSharingSubscriber

DiskManagementSubscriber

SecuritySubscriber

and others under 
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/RemoteManagement.framework/

This usually occurs when 
Remote Management or MDM (Mobile Device Management)
 is enabled on your Mac. If you did 
not knowingly authorize or enroll
 your Mac into a remote-management system or MDM (like Jamf, Mosyle, or Apple's own Remote Management), this strongly suggests an attacker has silently enrolled your device into a remote management profile or MDM.

✅ 
Immediate Actions (High Priority):

1. Verify Remote Management Profiles (Critical)

Check if an MDM or profiles are configured on your Mac:

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

profiles status -

type

 enrollment

and also run:

bash

Copy

Edit

profiles list

If there are any profiles listed that you did not install or authorize, this strongly indicates compromise.

2. Check Screen Sharing and Remote Management Status:

In Terminal, verify:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i screensharing
sudo launchctl list | grep -i remotemanagement

And check:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist

3. Immediate Isolation Steps (If unauthorized profiles found):

Disable remote management immediately
 by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -stop

Also disable Screen Sharing (as an extra precaution):

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing

3. Check Permissions granted by macOS Privacy (TCC Database):

bash

Copy

Edit

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

 | grep Desktop
