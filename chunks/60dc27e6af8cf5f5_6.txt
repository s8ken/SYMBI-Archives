=F0=9F=A7=A9 1. Datadog Browser SDK=
 Loaded Twice

c=
sharp

Copy code

[

Warning

]=
 Datadog Browser SDK: =E2=80=93 

"S=
DK is loaded more than once. This is unsupported..."

Cause

This means the Datadog browser monit=
oring script (
datadog-logs.js
 or 
datadog-rum.js
) is =
being injected 
multiple times
, possibly by:

Two separate tag managers (Datadog +=
 GTM or Clarity both adding it),

A client-side import and a hardcoded=

<script>
 tag,

A misconfigured build script that in=
cludes Datadog in both 
app.js
 and an injected snippet.

Fix

Search for multiple imports
 of Datadog:

b=
ash

Copy code

grep -r 

"datad=
og-logs"

 ./src

Ensure you 
only initialize Datadog once
, e.g.:

=
js

Copy code

import

 {=
 datadogLogs } 

from

=

'@datadog/browser-logs'

;
datadogLogs.

init

({ 

clientToken

: 

'xyz'

, 

site

: 

'datadoghq.com'

, 

forwardErrorsToLogs

=
: 

true

 });

If you use Google Tag Manager, rem=
ove Datadog from your GTM container and initialize it 
directly in your app code
.

=F0=9F=8C=80 2. Ortto Tracking Co=
de Already Initialized

css

Copy code

=

[Log]

 Ortto tr=
acking 

code

 already initialised

Cause

The same issue: Ortto (marketing a=
nalytics) script is being initialized twice, usually due to:

Multiple script tags (e.g. inside =

index.html
 and in 
app.js
),

Page rehydration on client-side na=
vigation (SPA reload).

Fix

Wrap initialization in a guard:

js

Copy code

if

 (!

window

.

_orttoInitialized

) {

window

=

.

_orttoInitialized

 =3D 

true

;

// Ortto init code here

}

=F0=9F=94=92 3. =E2=80=9CBlocked =
a frame with origin ... must match=E2=80=9D

csharp

Copy code

Blocked a frame 

with

 origin 

"https://=
super.myninja.ai"

from

 accessing a frame 

with

 origin 

"https://www.googletagmanager.com"

Cause

These are 
Cross-Origin Frame Access Errors (CORS/Same-Origin Po=
licy)
.

They happen when embedded scripts like Clarity, Stripe, GTM, or Google APIs=
 try to read data (like cookies or DOM) from each other.

This is 
normal and expected
 behavior =E2=80=94 browser=
s forbid cross-domain access.

Fix

You 
don=E2=80=99t need to fix this
 unless it=E2=80=99s=
 breaking functionality.

These warnings are safe to ignore =
for 3rd-party scripts (Stripe, GTM, Clarity, etc.).

If you=E2=80=99re injecting any 
iframe
 content dynamically=
 or using 
postMessage
, e=
nsure you=E2=80=99re not calling 
.contentWindow
 or 
.doc=
ument
 on cross-origin iframes.

=F0=9F=93=A6 4. =E2=80=9CFailed t=
o load resource: 404 / 425 .zip=E2=80=9D

lua

Copy code

=

Failed to 

load

 resource: the server responded with a 

status

 of 

425

 / 

404

 () (f874d24a-...zip)

Cause

These are likely session replay or=
 log payload uploads (e.g. from Clarity, Datadog, or your recorder) that:

reference expired session files,

or use wrong CDN/storage URLs.

Fix

If the URLs (like 
40420061-846a-4cb6-90fd-c65942fcfaa0.zip
=
) are your own assets =E2=86=92 verify the resource exists in your build ou=
tput or CDN.

If they=E2=80=99re generated by 
Datadog RUM
 or 
Microsoft Clarity
, it=E2=80=
=99s harmless. These 
.zip
 =E2=80=9Cchunks=E2=80=9D are session replay uploads failing transiently.

You can safely ignore 425 (=E2=80=
=9CToo Early=E2=80=9D) and 404 on those unless they=E2=80=99re flooding log=
s.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 5. clarity.js and re=
corder.js Frame Blocking

These are Microsoft Clarity=E2=80=
=99s internal scripts trying to track user behavior inside iframes that bel=
ong to Google or Stripe.

Fix

You can tell Clarity to skip ifram=
es:

js

Copy code

clarity

(

"set"

,=

"iframe"

, 

false

);

Or wrap initialization in a try/ca=
tch to prevent these internal stack traces from surfacing in the console.

=E2=9C=85 Recommended Clean Setup=

To stop console spam and unexpecte=
d tracking behavior:

Load each analytics SDK once only
 (Datadog, Clarity, G=
TM, Ortto).

Initialize 
only in prod
