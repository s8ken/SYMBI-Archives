Disable Clarity iframe tracking:

Copy code

clarity

(

"set"

,=

"iframe"

, 

false

);

Use 
async + defer
 on all 3rd-party 
<script>
 tags.

Review your GTM container for dupl=
icate tags.

Would you like me to give you a 
clean example snippet
 showing how to correctly init=
ialize Datadog, Clarity, Ortto, and GTM together (with guards to prevent du=
plicates)?

That setup usually eliminates all of these warnings.
