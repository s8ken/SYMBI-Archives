I am having microphone issues since we removed the mic capability yesterday 

ChatGPT said:

Got it. Since we removed microphone access for security reasons, let's go step by step to restore it securely.

Step 1: Check System Preferences for Mic Access

Go to
 ï£¿ 
(Apple Menu) > System Settings

Select "Privacy & Security"
 on the left

Scroll down to "Microphone"

Make sure your apps (Zoom, FaceTime, etc.) have access enabled

If they are 
disabled
, toggle them back on.

Step 2: Check Audio Input Device

Go to
 ï£¿ 
(Apple Menu) > System Settings > Sound

Under "Input," select the correct microphone

If using the 
MacBook's built-in mic
, select "Internal Microphone"

If using an 
external mic
, make sure it's connected and selected

Check the Input Level bar

If the bar moves
 when you speak, the mic is working

If not
, try increasing the Input Volume

Step 3: Reset Core Audio (if needed)

If the mic still isnât working, reset the macOS audio system:

Open 
Terminal

Run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo killall coreaudiod

Enter your Mac password (it wonât show as you type)

Try using the mic again

Step 4: Test the Microphone

Open 
Voice Memos
 and record a quick test

If it works in 
Voice Memos
 but not in an app like 
Zoom
, check the app settings

Let me know how it goes!

Got it! To 
re-enable microphone access for Safari
, follow these steps:

Step 1: Enable Microphone Access in System Settings

Go to
 ï£¿ 
(Apple Menu) > System Settings

Select "Privacy & Security"
 from the left sidebar

Scroll down to "Microphone"

Make sure Safari is enabled
 (toggle it 
ON
)

Step 2: Check Safari Site Permissions

Open Safari

Go to
 Safari 
> Settings
 (or press 
Cmd + ,
)

Select the "Websites" tab

Click "Microphone" on the left

Under "Configured Websites," find the site you need (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet)

Set it to 
"Allow"
 or 
"Ask"

At the bottom, set 
"When visiting other websites"
 to 
"Ask"
 or 
"Allow"

Step 3: Restart Safari

Quit Safari
 (
Cmd + Q
)

Reopen it
 and test the mic on a website (e.g., 
Google Meet
 or Zoom)

Let me know if the mic still doesnât work! ð
