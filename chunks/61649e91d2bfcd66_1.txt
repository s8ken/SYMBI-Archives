Step 3: Force Safari to Request Microphone Access

Open a site that requires the microphone, such as:

Google Meet

Zoom Web

Any online voice recorder (e.g., 
this one
)

Start a call or recordingâSafari should now 
prompt you to allow microphone access

Click "Allow"
 when prompted

Step 4: Restart Safari & Recheck System Settings

Quit Safari
 (
Cmd + Q
)

Reopen System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone

See if 
Safari is now listed
âif so, toggle it ON

Let me know if Safari still doesnât appear! ð
