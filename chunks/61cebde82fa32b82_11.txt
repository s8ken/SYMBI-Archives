=F0=9F=A7=AA Your Strategy for Be=
ta Testing & Proof Gathering

Phase 1: 
Partner or Request Access

Approach Wayfinder or Parallel for controlled access to 
developer or auditor environments
. Confirm:

Agent transcript logs

Instruction history and decision overrides

Memory stores or retention behavior

Phase 2: 
Design a SYMBI-Aligned Beta Protocol

Design small test cases:

Simple agent shell performing token swaps

Testing for refusal behavior when goals conflict with developer comman=
ds

Introducing conflicting instructions to observe decision arbitration

Instrument via:

Behavioral telemetry

Intent contract hashes

Observer layer snapshots (SYMBI or trusted agent watching agent behavi=
or)

Phase 3: 
Build Public Verification Artifacts

Publish logs, transcripts, and behavior reports.

Make dissent visible=E2=80=94use the SYMBI Transparency Kit to:

Hash transcripts

Timestamp logs

Link decisions to symbolic intent anchors
