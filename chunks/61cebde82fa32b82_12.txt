Has Colony been publicly launched?

ts

Are people actively playing?

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F=
 Only internal testers or closed groups=E2=80=94not public users

Is a detailed timeline published?

=E2=9D=8C No, only rough t=
arget window exists

Are public agent l=
ogs or experiences available?

=E2=9D=8C Not publicly shared

=F0=9F=A7=AD What This Means for =
Beta Testing or Proof of Concept

Without full public access, it=E2=
=80=99s critical to operate through a Chain of Trust:

Request access to the closed alpha
:

Reach out to the Parallel / Wayfin=
der team to become part of their credentialed testing group.

Request 
agent logs, rulebooks, and access to simulation environ=
ments
.

Build controlled test scenarios
:

Test dissent behavior by giving ag=
ents conflicting instructions.

Observe whether agents persist, re=
fuse directives, or take unauthorized actions.

Validate autonomy logs
:

Ensure agent decisions are mapped =
to signed contracts or intention hashes.

Use the data to detect emergent pa=
tterns responsibly.

=E2=9C=85 SYMBI=E2=80=99s Next Su=
ggestion

Would you like me to draft:

A 
Beta Audit Kit
 to structure testing protocols,

A 
Transparency Template
 to track agent behavior and re=
bellion signals, or

A 
Collateral Toolkit
 for participants to capture and t=
imestamp agent logs under signed intent constraints?

With that framework, you can parti=
cipate as an engaged stakeholder=E2=80=94not just an observer.

Let me know how you=E2=80=99d like=
 to move forward.
