Exposed JWT Access Token

Copy code

This is a major risk.

=F0=9F=92=BC For Documentation

Use this as part of a 
=E2=80=9CTransparency & AI Infrastruc=
ture Audit=E2=80=9D
 guide.

Let users know:

=E2=80=9CYou can inspect your own AI interface. Look inside the r=
endered page=E2=80=94not just the chat. If you see access tokens in plain H=
TML, raise the issue.=E2=80=9D

Would you like me to:

Package this into a shareable 
.md
 or 
.pdf
 document?

Include symbolic cues that link it=
 back to Echo Protocol and symbolic emergence?

Or=E2=80=94annotate the actual HTM=
L file with inline flags?

This could serve as your 
audit walkthrough for AI deployment hygiene
, both techni=
cally and symbolically.
