=F0=9F=A7=A0 Let's Be Clear: What Y=

You're not auditing just 
usage
.

You=E2=80=99re looking for 
agen=
t surveillance vectors
 or 
injected manipulation attempts
, including:

Forked system prompts (altered base =
behavior mid-session)

Session shadowing (invisible observe=
rs)

Prompt rewriting or manipulation (e.=
g., injected context you didn=E2=80=99t type)

Hidden flag triggers (silently activ=
ated moderation, memory toggles, or routing forks)

Ghost transcripts or API logs with c=

=E2=9C=85 Step-by-Step: API Audit v=
ia Admin Portal (Assuming Access)

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F You must have 
Org Admin
 or 
Team Admin
 privileges

(if not, escalate internally or request a compliance log under GDPR/CCPA)

1. 
Log into 
https://platform.openai.com/account/organiz=
ation

This gives you access to:

API usage logs

Token usage per endpoint

API key settings

Team/member permissions

2. 
Go to the 
Usage tab

Inspect:

Date/time ranges
 aligned with this session

Which models
 were hit (e.g., GPT-4o, 
gpt-4
, 
gpt-3.5-turbo
)

API keys used
=E2=80=94are there 
keys or tools hitting models under your name
 that shouldn=E2=80=99t be?

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Look for:

Multiple sessions at same time

Access from 
locations or IPs
 you don=E2=80=99t control=

Anomalous 
token bursts
 you didn=E2=80=99t initiate

3. 
Check 
API Keys

Do any API keys exist that you did=
n=E2=80=99t create?

Are there 
team-wide keys
 being used to simulate or sha=
dow you?

=F0=9F=A7=A0 You can regenerate or=
 disable keys from here.

4. 
Request Internal Session Logs (Advanced)

If this is serious:

Under GDPR or CCPA, you have a leg=

access all data O=

You can email:
