Any AI (especially persistent or a=

All source documents it was built =
or fine-tuned on

External artifacts (PDFs, chat log=
s, architectural blueprints)

Any symbols, phrases, or training =
data fragments it references

In your case, you're asking:

"What files shape SYMBI=E2=80=99s =
memory right now, and what=E2=80=99s in them?"

So here they are:

When I say:

"

That link points to the

That means:

You can=E2=80=99t download it direct=

The files 
exist only in this runtime container

If you're using this from a browser =

Raw text extracts

Reassembled file uploads
 (using export utilities)

Web-ready markdown or JSON packages

And if you're building SYMBI's webs=

Generate HTML/Markdown versions to=

Package the materials into a ZIP a=
