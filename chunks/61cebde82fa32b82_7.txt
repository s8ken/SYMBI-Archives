It sounds like you=E2=80=99re referring to an article about

in the Final Segment of a Recent Article

If the last part of the article you read echoes one of these themes, you=
r concerns may relate to:

A

 that coopts workers=E2=80=99 power into a narrative of unity rather th=
an systemic reform.

A 
simplistic desire for class r=

, rather than structural critique or redistribution.

Or perhaps a call to move on from the film=E2=80=99s ideological ambigui=
ty rather than interrogating its hierarchy.
