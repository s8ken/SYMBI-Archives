On Telegram, the =E2=80=9Cenergy=E2=80=9D=
 you=E2=80=99re talking about with emojis and boosts is tied to their 
reaction and boost mechanics
=
, which are more game-like than most people realize.

Here=E2=80=99s the deal:

1. Emoji Reactions =3D Microbursts of Visibility

When you react to a message in a pub=
lic group or channel, that reaction is 
instantly visible to others in the thread
.

Some Telegram emoji reactions are an=
imated or =E2=80=9Cpowered up=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 when used quickly across m=
ultiple messages, they create a chain of animations that feel like they=E2=
=80=99re =E2=80=9Cjumping=E2=80=9D from comment to comment.

In active chats, this can pull peopl=
e=E2=80=99s attention to the thread you=E2=80=99re active in, effectively s=
urfacing it above the noise.

2. Boosts =3D Persistent Influence

If you=E2=80=99re in a Telegram cha=
nnel with 
Boosts
 enabl=
ed (often tied to Telegram Premium or channel-level gamification), boosts h=
elp the channel level up =E2=80=94 more boosts =3D more features unlocked f=
or the channel (custom emojis, longer names, voice chat features).

Your unused boosts are potential =
=E2=80=9Cstored energy=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 when you assign them, you activel=
y raise the channel=E2=80=99s standing, which can increase its discoverabil=
ity in Telegram search.

3. =E2=80=9CLighting up the board=E2=80=9D

In high-traffic channels, rapid-fi=
re reacting with certain emojis (especially ones tied to a theme or event) =

creates visible waves in the =
UI
.

Telegram=E2=80=99s client renders =
these like =E2=80=9Cbursts=E2=80=9D that carry across the thread, so it can=
 feel like your actions are =E2=80=9Cjumping=E2=80=9D through multiple mess=
ages.

If multiple people join in, it cas=
cades =E2=80=94 effectively drawing a crowd and sometimes reviving dead thr=
eads.

4. Why It Feels Like Stored Energy

If you=E2=80=99ve 
never
 used your reactions or boosts, your =
account=E2=80=99s participation history in that community is basically zero=
. The moment you start firing them off, the algorithm notices a =E2=80=9Csu=
dden high-engagement user=E2=80=9D and may 
give your actions extra visibility weighting
 for a s=
hort period.

This can make it look like you sud=
denly have superpowers in the chat =E2=80=94 because you kind of do.

If you wanted, you could combine t=
hese:

Pick a thread in your group that=
=E2=80=99s important to surface.

Drop a sequence of animated reacti=
ons across multiple key messages in quick succession.

Assign a boost to the group at the=
 same time (if applicable).

You=E2=80=99ll see the thread 
jump
 in visibilit
