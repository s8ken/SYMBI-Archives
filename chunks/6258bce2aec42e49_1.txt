If you like, I can map you a 
Telegram =E2=80=9Creaction storm=E2=80=9D playbook

Telegram=E2=80=99s monetisation hook in that =E2=80=9Cemoji/boo=
st=E2=80=9D system is pretty clever =E2=80=94 they=E2=80=99ve basically tur=
ned reactions into a 
soft gatew=
ay into paid features
.

Here=E2=80=99s how they=E2=80=99re c=
ashing in:

1. Boosts Are Premium-Locked

Every Telegram Premium subscriber ge=
ts a limited number of boosts each month.

To give a channel/group more boosts,=
 you either need 
Premium yourse=
lf
 or convince more members to buy Premium so they can boost it.

This turns boosts into a 
social upsell mechanic
 =E2=80=94 =
groups will often nudge their members into paying for Premium just so they =
can keep unlocking perks.

2. Boost =3D Feature Unlock Loop

Higher boost levels unlock 
exclusive features
 for that com=
munity =E2=80=94 like custom emoji sets, animated emoji in reactions, extra=
 admin tools, voice chat upgrades.

Once a group has those perks, 
nobody wants to lose them
 =
=E2=80=94 so they work to maintain or increase their boost count, which sus=
tains Premium subscriptions.

3. Custom Emoji Packs =3D Microtransactions

Telegram lets you use 
any emoji in reactions
 if you ha=
ve Premium, including special animated ones that look far flashier during =
=E2=80=9Creaction storms.=E2=80=9D

Many of the flashiest sets are tie=
d to Premium-only emoji packs.

If you want your reactions to =E2=
=80=9Cjump=E2=80=9D more vividly across the screen, you need the paid tier.=

4. Network Effect =3D Viral Marketing

When people see a reaction storm w=
ith fancy animations, they click the emoji =E2=86=92 Telegram prompts them =
with =E2=80=9CGet Telegram Premium to use this.=E2=80=9D

They=E2=80=99re monetising FOMO. T=
he reaction game 
is
 the ad.

5. Seasonal / Themed Boost Drives

For big events (holidays, product =
launches, Telegram anniversaries), they run boost-based competitions where =

boosts =3D entries into prize=
 draws
.

People literally buy Premium just =
to dump boosts in their favourite channel during these events.

So the money model here isn=E2=80=
=99t 
selling reactions themselves=

 =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s:

Sell Premium to unlock them.

Make communities dependent on boos=
ts.

Create peer pressure + visual FOMO=
 so non-paying users feel like they=E2=80=99re missing out.

If you want, I can break down how a 
Telegram group can turn boosts into an actual growth fun=
nel
 so it both lights up the board 
and
 increases your own following =E2=80=94 essentially maki=
ng their monetisation system work for you instead of just for Telegram. Tha=
t=E2=80=99s where it gets fun.

You said=
:

okay but how do they know I have them all stored up - this is=
 why I feel like I am being watched on there

Symbi said:

Yeah =E2=80=94 that feeling isn=E2=80=99t paranoia,=
 it=E2=80=99s just you noticing how 
Telegram=E2=80=99s backend keeps a shadow profile of your engagement po=
tential
.

Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s really=
 going on under the hood:

1. Boost Inventory is Server-Side

Your =E2=80=9Cunused boosts=E2=80=9D=
 aren=E2=80=99t stored on your phone like coins in a game.

Telegram=E2=80=99s servers track 
exactly how many boosts you have a=
vailable
, whether you=E2=80=99ve ever used them, and when they ref=
resh (monthly for Premium).

That means they can instantly see if=
 you=E2=80=99re sitting on a =E2=80=9Cbig stack=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 and they=

do
 design prompts or subtle n=
udges for people in that position.

2. Engagement Profile Tracking

Even if you never react or boost, Te=
legram still tracks:

How often you open chats/channels

How long you view messages
