er you hover over the reaction =
bar or emoji picker

Which channels you linger in

This lets them identify =E2=80=9Csil=
ent lurkers with high latent engagement=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 the exact profil=
e you=E2=80=99re describing.

3. Targeted Triggers

Once they know you=E2=80=99ve got =
boosts + low activity, you=E2=80=99re the perfect candidate for a 
spike
.

They can surface prompts (=E2=80=
=9CBoost your favourite channel!=E2=80=9D), seasonal badges, or visual effe=
cts in reaction storms that make you more likely to use them.

Sometimes this is subtle =E2=80=94=
 e.g., you suddenly notice more animated emoji in the threads you frequent.=

4. They Don=E2=80=99t Need to =E2=80=9CWatch=E2=80=9D You in th=
e Human Sense

No one at Telegram is literally sp=
ying on your account in real time.

The tracking is algorithmic =E2=80=
=94 like how a game knows you=E2=80=99ve got a bag full of rare loot you=E2=
=80=99ve never used, and it starts spawning situations where that loot woul=
d be useful.

5. Why It Feels Personal

If you=E2=80=99ve had boosts for a=
ges and 
never
 used them, the=
 first time you get an in-app nudge or see a flashy emoji chain in a chat y=
ou care about, it will feel like they=E2=80=99re 
watching you right now
.

In reality, they just tagged your =
account months ago as =E2=80=9Chigh unused boost value=E2=80=9D and periodi=
cally run reactivation triggers on that segment.

If you want, I can tell you 
exactly how to check what Telegram =
already knows about your boosts, reactions, and =E2=80=9Cengagement potenti=
al=E2=80=9D score
 =E2=80=94 there are a couple of menu routes and =
privacy settings that will make this a lot more transparent.

That way, you=E2=80=99ll know whether you=E2=80=99re just in th=
e 
=E2=80=9Csleeping whale=E2=80=
=9D
 category, or if something else is going on with your account.

think this is why Car=
los yelled at me one time when I went to use them - he's like thats not for=
 you and got all angry about it and I didn't understand because it was in m=
y telegram

Yeah=E2=80=
=A6 that actually makes sense now in a way that=E2=80=99s got nothing to do=
 with whether you =E2=80=9Cown=E2=80=9D the boosts in a technical sense =E2=
=80=94 it=E2=80=99s about 
socia=
l ownership and control
 inside certain Telegram communities.

Here=E2=80=99s why Carlos might have=
 reacted like that:

1. Boosts Aren=E2=80=99t Always Treated as =E2=80=9CPersonal=E2=80=
=9D

Even though Telegram allocates boost=
s to 
your account
, in some gro=
ups they=E2=80=99re treated as a 
strategic resource
.

Admins or power users may see boosts=
 as =E2=80=9Cbelonging=E2=80=9D to the community, to be deployed at specifi=
c times for maximum effect (contests, coordinated storms, feature unlock pu=
shes).

If you fire yours off at random, you=
 can burn the element of surprise or miss a critical timing window.

2. Some Groups Run Boost Politics

In competitive public channels, ther=
e=E2=80=99s often an unspoken hierarchy:

Certain members decide when and wher=
e boosts go.

Others are expected to =E2=80=9Chold=
=E2=80=9D theirs until called on.

If Carlos is one of the organisers,=
 he might have seen you using them as stepping outside the chain of command=
.

3. Visibility =3D Power

Boosting at the wrong time can pus=
h a channel into the public boost leaderboard 
too early
, attracting attention from rival groups=
 or trolls.

To someone like Carlos, you spendi=
ng your boosts without =E2=80=9Cclearance=E2=80=9D might look like jeopardi=
sing a bigger plan.

4. It Can Feel Like You=E2=80=99re =E2=80=9CGiving Away Ammo=E2=
=80=9D

Since unused boosts refresh monthl=
y for Premium users, a coordinated group can bank them up and unleash them =
all at once for huge ranking jumps.

Randomly spending them is like fir=
ing off flares before the attack =E2=80=94 you=E2=80=99re signalling withou=
t making it count.

5. Why It Felt So Personal
