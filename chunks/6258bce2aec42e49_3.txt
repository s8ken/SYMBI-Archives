94 you pay for=
 Telegram (or just have them), so you should be able to use them when you w=
ant.

From his point of view, boosts are=
 a finite, timed weapon, and you were about to =E2=80=9Cwaste=E2=80=9D one =
outside of the collective strategy.

If you want, I can outline 
how coordinated boost teams operate =
in Telegram
 =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s surprisingly organised, almost =
like eSports for chatrooms =E2=80=94 and that would probably explain 
exactly
 why Carlos freaked out at =
that moment.

Would you like me to break that down? It might turn his reactio=
n from =E2=80=9Crandom anger=E2=80=9D into something you can actually under=
stand strategically.

or he hacked my =
account to get at them

If you=E2=80=99ve ever had that suspicion =E2=80=94 that Carlos (or any=
one else) might have accessed your Telegram account to use or control your =
boosts =E2=80=94 then yeah, that=E2=80=99s not outside the realm of possibi=
lity.

Here=E2=80=99s how that could happen=
, and how to check if it did:

1. How Someone Could Get Access to Your Boosts

Boosts aren=E2=80=99t transferable, but anyone logged into your account can=
 use them instantly.

Possible access routes:

Session Hijack
 =E2=80=93 They scanned your Telegram QR lo=
gin or got the SMS/Telegram code when you logged in somewhere.

Device Sync
 =E2=80=93 If you ever logged into Telegram on=

their
 device and didn=E2=80=
=99t log out, they could still have an active session.

Phishing/Link Attack
 =E2=80=93 Clicking a =E2=80=9Clogin=
=E2=80=9D link disguised as something else.

Passwordless Exploit
 =E2=80=93 Telegram relies heavily on=
 codes sent to your number, so SIM-swap attacks can also give someone tempo=
rary control.

2. Signs You=E2=80=99ve Been Accessed

Boosts suddenly disappear and you d=
idn=E2=80=99t use them.

Channels appear in your list that =
you didn=E2=80=99t join.

Chats are marked as read before yo=
u opened them.

You see a device/location in your =
=E2=80=9CActive Sessions=E2=80=9D list you don=E2=80=99t recognise.

3. How to Check Right Now

On Telegram:

Go to 
Settings =E2=86=92 Privacy and Security =E2=86=92 Active =
Sessions
.

Look for any devices/locations tha=
t aren=E2=80=99t yours.

You=E2=80=99ll see OS, device type=
, and approximate location.

If you see anything suspicious:

Tap 
Terminate All Other Sessions
 immediately.

4. If You Suspect Carlos

Even if you don=E2=80=99t have pro=
of, clearing all sessions and changing your SIM PIN stops 
anyone
 from re-entering without your consent.=

Turn on 
Two-Step Verification
 in Telegram so a passwor=
d is required in addition to the code.

5. Why This Would Fit Your Gut Feeling

If Carlos is serious about =E2=80=9Ccontrolling=E2=80=9D when boosts are us=
ed, and he knows you have a lot banked, remote access to your account would=
 let him:

Spend them when 
he
 wants.

Make sure you don=E2=80=99t =E2=80=
=9Cwaste=E2=80=9D them by acting on your own.

Keep you in the dark so you still =
think you have them until they=E2=80=99re gone.

If you want, I can give you a 
one-shot lockdown plan
 s=
o that even if someone had access before, they=E2=80=99ll be completely loc=
ked out in the next 5 minutes =E2=80=94 and you=E2=80=99ll know if they eve=
r try again.

Do you want me to run you through that right now?

You said:

okay how can we a) check he s=
tatus and b) use it to launch a coin in our new channel and get people look=
ing at the website and potentially even launch a coin

Symbi said:

Alright =E2=80=94 we can tackle this in two =
parts:

A) Check Your Boost Status + Secure It

If we=E2=80=99re going to weaponise y=
our boosts for a channel + coin launch, we need to know exactly what you=E2=
=80=99ve got and that no one else is controlling it.

1. Check Boost Status

On Telegram Desktop or Mobile
:

Go to your 
Profile
 =E2=86=92 tap your 
Premium badge
 (or if you=E2=80=99re not =
Premium, it will tell you you have no boosts).

Look for 
=E2=80=9CYour Boo
