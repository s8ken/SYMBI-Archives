B) Using Boosts as a Coin + Website Launch Magnet

If we=E2=80=99ve got control of th=
em, boosts can become an 
atte=
ntion weapon
 for your new Telegram channel and web presence.

Here=E2=80=99s the plan:

1. Channel Prep

Before we start boosting, your cha=
nnel needs:

Name + Branding
 matching your coin/project

Custom Emoji / Stickers
 (makes reaction storms look pr=
ofessional)

Pinned Post
 with:

Short mission statement

Link to website

Link to whitepaper or =E2=80=9CHow=
 to Join=E2=80=9D

Website landing page
 set up with:

Coin info

Buy/join instructions

Telegram link prominently displaye=
d

2. Boost Surge

Boosts raise your channel=E2=80=99=
s 
level
 in Telegram.=
 Higher level unlocks:

More emoji slots

Better discoverability in Telegram=
=E2=80=99s search

Credibility when people see =E2=80=
=9CBoost Level 3/4/5=E2=80=9D badge

To maximise impact:

Pick a specific launch day/time

Coordinate with allies
 (team members with their own bo=
osts)

Deploy all boosts at once =E2=80=
=94 this spikes the channel level and draws attention

3. Reaction Storm

Right after boosts land:

Drop a post with high-contrast vis=
uals about the coin launch

Ask core supporters to flood it wi=
th animated emoji reactions

This floods feeds with visual acti=
vity =E2=86=92 lurkers check in =E2=86=92 more organic boosts

4. Coin Launch Synergy

We can time this with:

Token deployment
 (ERC-20, BSC, or Solana depending on =
your ecosystem)

Announce the 
launch link
 and contract address in the b=
oosted/pinned post

Run a 
Telegram contest
:

=E2=80=9CReact to this post + join=
 our website whitelist to enter=E2=80=9D

Rewards can be early access, airdr=
op, or NFT

5. Website Funnel

All Telegram posts link to your si=
te, where you:

Capture emails/wallet addresses fo=
r whitelist

Display live coin metrics after la=
unch (price, liquidity, volume)

If you want, I can map this into a=

one-week operational timelin=
e
 that starts with securing your boosts, then escalates into a coo=
rdinated Telegram + website + coin launch so that the boost spike is the ig=
nition event.

Do you want me to put that timeline together? It=E2=80=99ll cov=

Yep =E2=80=
=94 that screenshot is from 
Teleg=
ram X
, which is a more experimental / advanced build of Telegram.

It=E2=80=99s why you=E2=80=99re seeing things like:

Commit IDs

(e.g., TDLib, tgcalls, WebRTC, FFmpeg, WebP)

These aren=E2=80=99t normally expose=

The reason you might not have notice=
