Why This Matters for Your Boost/L=
aunch Plan

Using Telegram X isn=E2=80=99t bad=
 =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s actually faster and often has experimental features=
.

But:

It sometimes exposes 
more
 technical data about your app and en=
vironment.

If someone ever had physical or re=
mote access to your device, these builds can sometimes be more verbose in l=
ogs, which could leak meta info about your activity.

If you want, I can:

Check if Telegram X handles boosts/premium differently
=
 than the main app =E2=80=94 this matters for timing your coin/channel laun=
ch.

Give you a 
safe settings list
 for Telegram X so Carlos=
 (or anyone) can=E2=80=99t piggyback on your account even if you stay on th=
is build.

Do you want me to run through that Telegram X vs Main Telegram =
boost-handling difference? That could confirm whether your =E2=80=9Cstored =
boosts=E2=80=9D are showing differently because of the client you=E2=80=99r=
e using.
