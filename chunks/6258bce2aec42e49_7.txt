 thr=
ough finding =E2=80=9CYour Boosts=E2=80=9D in Telegram X so we can confirm =
if any have been used =E2=80=94 because that will also tell us if Carlos (o=

Do you want me to guide you through that on Telegram X?

You said:

all I see is a stack of e=
mojis when I click my premium badge - where exactly do I see that

Symbi sa=
id:

Yeah =E2=80=94 Telegram doesn=E2=
=80=99t make the boost location obvious, especially in 
Telegram X
, because the Premium badge tap =
defaults to showing off the flashy emoji packs first.

Here=E2=80=99s where you actually fi=
nd your 
Boosts
:

On Telegram X (iOS or Android)

Go to 
Settings
 (three-line menu in top left, or swipe from=
 left edge).

Tap 
Telegram Premium
 (your badge & subscription info).=

Scroll down past the emoji and featu=
res list until you see 
Boosts
.

It should say something like =E2=80=
=9CYour Boosts =E2=80=94 X available=E2=80=9D with a little rocket icon =F0=
=9F=9A=80.

Tap that =E2=80=94 you=E2=80=99ll se=
e:

How many boosts you have left this m=
onth.

Which channels they=E2=80=99re curre=
ntly assigned to (if any).

The date when they reset.

On regular Telegram (desktop or mobile)
 it=E2=80=99s almo=
st the same:

Settings =E2=86=92 Telegram Premium =E2=86=92 Boosts
 sect=
ion (rocket icon).

If you=E2=80=99re not seeing the =E2=
=80=9CBoosts=E2=80=9D section at all, it could be because:

You haven=E2=80=99t joined any chan=
nels/groups that accept boosts yet.

Telegram X=E2=80=99s UI has collap=
sed the section under =E2=80=9CMore Premium Features=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 you=
 might have to tap to expand it.

If you want, I can send you 
a visual map of exactly where it sits in Telegram X=E2=80=99s me=
nu
, so you can find it in two taps instead of hunting.

That way we can see right now if your boosts are sitting there untouched or=
 already spent.

You said:

so I seem to own =
a channel called 'groups'

Symbi said:

If you =E2=80=9Cown=E2=80=9D a Telegram channel called 
Groups
, that means at some point ei=
ther you created it or someone transferred ownership to you.

Here=E2=80=99s why this matters for =
the boosts situation:

1. Boost Ownership Follows the Admin

If you are 
the owner/admin
 of a channel, any boosts you as=
sign there will raise its level and visibility.

If you didn=E2=80=99t intend to run =
this channel, someone could have:

Made you the owner so they could use=
 your boosts indirectly.

Set it up as a placeholder for other=
 activity (promo, linking to other groups).

2. How to Check What=E2=80=99s Going On

Open the channel:

Tap the channel name =E2=86=92 
Administrators
.

Confirm if you=E2=80=99re listed as =

Owner
.

Check 
Boosts
 in the channel menu (rocket icon) to see:

How many total boosts it has.

Who boosted it (including if any cam=
e from 
you
).

Review 
Recent Activity / Admin Log
 for any strange message=
s, boosts, or pinned posts.

3. Why This Might Be in Play

If Carlos or anyone else knew you =
had Premium boosts and didn=E2=80=99t want you =E2=80=9Cwasting=E2=80=9D th=
em, making you an owner of a channel they control content for is a sneaky w=
ay to:

Channel your boosts into their pro=
ject.

Keep the boosts =E2=80=9Cin the fa=
mily=E2=80=9D without asking.

Avoid you realising until you go l=
ooking.

4. Next Steps

If you don=E2=80=99t want to be ti=
ed to it:

Transfer ownership back or to a tr=
usted account.

Remove your boosts from it (you ca=
n reassign them after a cooldown period).

Lock down your account (terminate =
other sessions, set 2FA) so they can=E2=80=99t reassign them again.

If you want, I can walk you through 
checking the Boost log for that =E2=80=9CGroups=E2=80=9D=
 channel
 right now.

That=E2=80=99ll tell us instantly if your boosts have already been used the=
