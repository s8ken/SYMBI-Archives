=F0=9F=A7=A0 Reasoning Behind the=
 Structure

The weighting reflects:

The origin of SYMBI as an independ=
ent, founder-led research and codebase (documented across 158 archival deve=
lopment sessions and multi-site architecture).

The near-term goal of building a s=
mall, highly skilled founding team around the 
SYMBI trust protocol
 and 
SYMBI-SYNERGY
 backend.

Commitment to 
open-core licensing
 and 
ethical AI governance
, with long-t=
erm inclusion of contributors through grants or equity-linked fellowships (=
via Gammatria research foundation).

=F0=9F=AA=9C Future Allocation No=

Equity cliffs and vesting
 will follow a 4-year vesting=
 schedule with a 1-year cliff for all founders and early employees.

Gammatria (nonprofit)
 will not hold equity directly bu=
t may receive grant-based funding for governance and research continuity.

Future rounds may include a 
community or public research pool (=
1=E2=80=932%)
 tied to open-source development contributions.

Would you like me to format this in 
YC form-answer tone
