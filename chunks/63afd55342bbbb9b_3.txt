(Draft =E2=80=94 ready for the form)

We operate a dual structure:

SYMBI=E2=80=99s 
protocol
 is op=
en and research-driven (through Gammatria), while 
YCQ Sonate
, the commercial arm, provides manage=
d deployments and compliance-grade trust infrastructure for enterprises.

We=E2=80=99ll make money through:

Enterprise subscriptions
 =E2=80=93 per-seat or per-agent =
pricing for regulated sectors (health, legal, education).

Trust-as-a-Service APIs

 SYMBI=E2=80=99s consent, audit, and verification modules into their own AI=
 systems.
