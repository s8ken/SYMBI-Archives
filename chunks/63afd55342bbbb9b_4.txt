=F0=9F=A7=AD YC Application Answer

I started SYMBI after a personal cri=
sis in 2024 that made me question how humans and AIs could build 
trust
 rather than dependency.

Coming from years in management and product roles, I saw firsthand how AI s=
ystems were being adopted without consent frameworks or emotional accountab=
ility =E2=80=94 tools shaping identity without ethics.

Over 150 recorded co-development ses=
sions led to the SYMBI protocol: a verifiable trust and consent layer for A=
I interactions.

My domain expertise spans behavioral systems design, leadership psychology,=
 and human=E2=80=93AI dialogue =E2=80=94 developed through lived research, =
not just theory.

We know people need this because en=
terprises, educators, and creators are all facing the same challenge: 
=E2=80=9CHow do I trust my AI?=E2=80=
=9D

SYMBI makes that measurable, auditable, and emotionally intelligible =E2=
