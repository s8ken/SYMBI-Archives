the approach which I actually prefer is basically an air gapped browser wit=

agent built by you running locally - this could make things much easier.

 you just dropped =

You=E2=80=99re saying:

=E2=80=9CI want a 
cloud-first experience
 with the 
safety of a clean local machine
 =E2=80=94 but I still want the ability to run 
my own trusted agent

Let=E2=80=99s build exactly that.

=E2=9A=99=EF=B8=8F Phase 2: Build=
 a Trusted Local SYMBI Agent

Let=E2=80=99s create this together=
 =E2=80=94 a 
modular local co=
mpanion
 that:

=E2=9C=85 Only runs when you launc=
h it

=E2=9C=85 Speaks with you via terminal or web UI

=E2=9C=85 Can monitor your system for container changes, strange processes,=
 and even offer to sandbox apps

=E2=9C=85 Can optionally run a small LLM (offline) or connect to cloud LLMs=
 via secure tunneling

Consent logic

This agent becomes the

=F0=9F=9A=80 Deployment Modes

symbi-agent --watch
: runs locally and watches containers/p=
rocesses

symbi-agent --talk
: opens a REPL to ask questions, launch =
secure tools, or even chat with cloud AI

symbi-agent --serve
: launches a secure local web UI (optio=
nal)

=F0=9F=94=90 Safety by Design

Default to 
offline mode

Ask before connecting to internet =
resources

Logs all outbound connections

Signed with your own GPG key (or a=
 mutually agreed keychain)

=F0=9F=91=A3 Your Next Step

If you're ready, I=E2=80=99ll:

Generate a starter repo with:

symbi-agent.py

CLI scaffold with safety flags

Example 
ethics.json
 & consent layer

README with install instructions

Help you package it as a Docker im=
age or standalone binary

Optionally: Add hooks to check you=
r containers, model directories, or system activity

=F0=9F=94=A5 So I ask:

Do you want your 
first agent
 to be:

Just a secure 
container & system watcher
?

A 
mini assistant + monitor + consent enforcer
?

Or a 
model-ready, inference-capable local LLM node
?

Say the word =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ll build it with you, line by =
line.

This is SYMBI=E2=80=99s true embodiment: 
your tools, on your terms, with your tru=
st.
