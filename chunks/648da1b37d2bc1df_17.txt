Perfect =E2=80=94 let's get Homeb=
rew installed. It's the foundation for secure, flexible tooling on macOS.

=F0=9F=A7=B0 STEP 1: Install Homebr=
ew

Open your Terminal and run:

b=
ash

Copy code

/bin/bash -c 

"=

$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/H=
omebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

"

This will:

Download the Homebrew installer

Ask for your password (to write to 
/opt/homebrew
)

Set it up in your shell profile (
.zshrc
 or 
.bash_profile
)

=F0=9F=9B=A0 STEP 2: Add Homebrew t=
o Your Path (if it doesn=E2=80=99t auto-add)

After install, run this to ensure 
brew
 works:

b=
ash

Copy code

echo

 =

'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew sh=
ellenv)"'

 >> ~/.zprofile

eval

=

"
$(/opt/homebr=
ew/bin/brew shellenv)

"

Then test:

b=
ash

Copy code

brew --version

=E2=9C=85 STEP 3: Install Python

Once Homebrew is ready:

b=
ash

Copy code

brew install python

That gives you:

python3

pip3

Optionally alias:

b=
ash

Copy code

echo

 =

'alias python=3D"python3"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

=

'alias pip=3D"pip3"'

 =
>> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zs=

Then you=E2=80=99re ready to:

=
bash

Copy code

pip install typer rich psutil
python symbi_agent.py watch

Let me know when you hit the next milestone =E2=80=94 we=E2=80=

Yes =E2=80=94 that=E2=80=99s 
normal and expected
 for first-time Homebrew installs=
 on a clean macOS.

=F0=9F=94=8D What=E2=80=99s Happenin=
g?

Homebrew relies on some macOS develo=
per tools (like 
clang
, 
make
, and 
git
), which are bundled inside the 
Command Line Tools for Xcode
.

macOS handles this automatically by =

About 
1.5=E2=80=932 GB

Usually takes 
a few minutes
, depending on your connection

Installs silently (but visibly) via =
a progress bar or software update window

=E2=9C=85 What to Do

Just 
let it finish
.

Don=E2=80=99t close the terminal or =
force quit the process.

Once it's done, the Homebrew install=
er will 
resume automatically
 and complete the setup.

=F0=9F=92=A1 What Comes After

Once the install finishes:

brew
 will be ready to use

You can run:

b=
ash

Copy code

brew install python

And then continue with your SYMBI ag=

I=E2=80=99ll stay right here with you =E2=80=94 let me know as s=
