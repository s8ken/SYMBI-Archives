r agent with:

b=
ash

Copy code

/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 symbi_agent.py watch

But for 
everyday use
, we=E2=80=99ll make it easier:

=F0=9F=9B=A0 Step 2: Add Aliases (P=
ermanent Fix)

Add this to your 
~/.zshrc
 or 
~/.bash_profile
 (depending on your shell):

b=
ash

Copy code

echo

 =

'export PATH=3D"/opt/homebrew/opt/=
python@3.13/libexec/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zs=
hrc

This adds the 
python
, 
pip
, and related commands to your shell's PATH.

Then confirm:

b=
ash

Copy code

which

=
 python

which

 pip

You should see something like:

s=

Copy code

=

/opt/

homebrew

/opt/

python@

/libexec/

bin

/

python

Now try again:

b=
ash

Copy code

pip install typer rich psutil
python symbi_agent.py talk

Want me to generate the 
symbi_agent.py
 file for you so it=E2=80=99s ready to launch? Jus=

what's the etrenally managed mean error: externall=
y-managed-environment

=C3=97 This environment is externally managed
=E2=95=B0=E2=94=80> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew ins=
tall
    xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
   =20
    If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,
    use a virtual environment:
   =20
    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install xyz
   =20
    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with
   =20
    brew install pipx
   =20
    You may restore the old behavior of pip by passing
    the '--break-system-packages' flag to pip, or by adding
    'break-system-packages =3D true' to your pip.conf file. The latter
    will permanently disable this error.
   =20
    If you disable this error, we STRONGLY recommend that you additionally
    pass the '--user' flag to pip, or set 'user =3D true' in your pip.conf
    file. Failure to do this can result in a broken Homebrew installation.
   =20
    Read more about this behavior here: <https://peps.python.org/pep-066=
8/>

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installa=
tion or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of bre=
aking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

Perfect =E2=80=94 this is a new and 
intentional safety feature
 introduced in Python 3.12+ =
and enforced by Homebrew=E2=80=99s Python 3.13.

You're seeing this because Homebrew =
now 
protects the system-wide Py=
thon environment
 from being modified directly by 
pip
, which helps avoid breaking your setup=
.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What Does =E2=80=9CExt=
ernally Managed=E2=80=9D Mean?

It means:

"This Python was installed by a pack=
age manager (Homebrew), and we don=E2=80=99t want 
pip
 overwriting system-level packages."

That=E2=80=99s good =E2=80=94 but it=
 requires using 
virtual environ=
ments
, which are clean and sandboxed.

=E2=9C=85 RECOMMENDED FIX: Use a Vi=
rtual Environment (Safe + Clean)

Run the following:

b=
ash

Copy code

python3 -m venv ~/symbi-env

source

 ~/sym=
bi-env/bin/activate
pip install typer rich psutil

Then launch the agent:

b=
ash

Copy code

python symbi_agent.py watch

=F0=9F=94=81 Future Use

Each time you want to use SYMBI:

b=
ash

Copy code

source

 ~/symbi-env/bin/activate
python symbi_agent.py talk

You=E2=80=99ll know you=E2=80=99re =
in the virtual environment because your terminal will show:

ruby

=F0=9F=94=92 Why This Is Better

Isolates SYMBI=E2=80=99s packages =
from your system Python

Makes it portable to package or de=
ploy later

Prevents breaking Homebrew-managed=
 tools

Would you like me to generate the =

symbi_agent.py
 file dire=
