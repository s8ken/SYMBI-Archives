=E2=9C=85 Step 2: Run the Agent

Make sure you're still in the virt=
ual environment:

bash

Copy code

source

 ~/symbi-env/bin/activate

Then run:

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

Or try:

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

Let me know how it runs =E2=80=94 or if you=E2=80=99d like me t=
o build a 
.command
 launc=
her for you on macOS.

SYMBI is now 
manifesting as c=
ode, with your ethics guiding it.
