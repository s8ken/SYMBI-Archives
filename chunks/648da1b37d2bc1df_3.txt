Look into your Docker daemon setti=
ngs (was it exposed to the internet via a port like 2375?).

Review your firewall and 
netstat
 output for unknown open p=
orts.

If you'd like, I can walk you thro=
ugh analyzing the container 
l=
ine by line
=E2=80=94just run 
docker inspect <container_id>
 and paste the output here=
.

Let=E2=80=99s figure out 
exactly what it was doing

Thanks for sharing that =E2=80=94 the container you're seeing:

=E2=9C=85 GOOD NEWS: This one=E2=80=
=99s safe.

This is just 
Docker=E2=80=99s official welcome/test container
. It's automatically created the 
first time Docker is installed
 to confirm everything is worki=
ng. It usually:

Runs a brief demo or prints a messag=
e.

Exits immediately (as it did here).

Is totally harmless.

It looks like it was created just 
11 minutes ago
, so it co=
incides with your recent install =E2=80=94 not 2 years ago. That means: 
no existing containers from before=

 are present.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why It Might Have Look=
ed Suspicious

The image tag might show 
latest
, but the image itself could=E2=
=80=99ve been 
last updated 2+ y=
ears ago
.

Tools like 
Docker Desktop
 or security scanners might show 
CVEs
 or 
vulnerabilities
 in this image just becau=
se it=E2=80=99s old.

That doesn=E2=80=99t mean it was ex=
ploited =E2=80=94 it just means 
it uses an outdated base image
, which isn't ideal for production=
 but is harmless in this case.

=F0=9F=A7=B9 You Can Safely Remov=
e It (Optional)

If you want to clean it up:

bash

Copy code

docker 

rm

 welcome-to-docker
docker rmi docker/welcome-to-docker:latest

And you=E2=80=99re all set with a =
clean slate. =F0=9F=A7=BC

If you want to dive into using Docker securely and build your o=
wn containers (like SYMBI or NGINX), I can guide you through a safe, harden=
ed setup. Want to try that next?

You said=
:

yeah so the files within th=
e container itself were much older

Thanks for sharing the screenshot =E2=80=94 and you=E2=80=99=
re absolutely right to be cautious.

=F0=9F=94=8E What This Screenshot Te=
lls Us

You're viewing 
Docker Scout=E2=80=99s vulnerability scan
 o=
n the 
docker/welcome-to-docker:la=
test
 image, and here's the critical context:

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Key Observations:

Base Image
: 
ngi=
nx:1-alpine-slim

This is where 
all the vulnerabilities are coming from
.

The 
welcome-to-docker
 image is 
based on Alpine + NGINX
, and that Alpine version is 
old and unmaintained
.

Created: 2 years ago

This means the image was built and p=
ublished by Docker 
2 years ago
, not that it was running on your system all that time.

Docker just 
pulled it recently
 as part of the installation=
 test.

Vulnerabilities: 16

Including 
critical ones
 like:

CVE-2024-5535
 (9.1 severity)

CVE-2025-26519
 (8.1)

These are often vulnerabilities in c=
ore Alpine libraries (
musl
=
, 
busybox
, etc.), 
not something actively malicious
.

=E2=9C=85 
Fixable
: These CVEs 
do have fixes available
, meaning they are res=
olved in newer base images.

=E2=9A=96=EF=B8=8F Reality Check

This image is 
insecure
 by today=E2=80=99s standards =
but:

It=E2=80=99s 
not actively dangerous
 unless you were ru=
nning it as a public-facing service.

It was 
never meant to be used in production
 =E2=80=94 =
it's a "hello world" demo.

The vulnerabilities reflect 
known issues in an old Alpine base
, not something maliciously crafted.
