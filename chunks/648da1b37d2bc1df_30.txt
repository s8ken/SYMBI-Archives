=F0=9F=92=A5 Got it =E2=80=94 now we can 
conclusively resolve
 what=E2=80=99s happ=
ening.

You're running:

ba=
sh

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

But getting:

j=
ava

Copy code

=

Got unexpected extra 

argument

(ta=
lk)

This means:

Typer is running, but it 
doesn=
=E2=80=99t recognize 
talk
 =
as a valid command
 =E2=80=94 which only happens when...

=F0=9F=94=8D Final Diagnosis: You=
=E2=80=99re Missing the Decorator

You probably have this:

p=
ython

Copy code

def

=

talk

=
():
    ...

But you're 
missing this
 right above it:

p=
ython

Copy code

@app.command()

def

talk

():
    ...

That 
@app.command()
 is how Typer knows 
talk
 is a valid subcommand.

=E2=9C=85 Fix: Add the Decorator

Open the file:

b=
ash

Copy code

nano ~/symbi_agent.py

Ensure this is what the REPL section=
 looks like:

=
python

Copy code

@app.command()

def

talk

():

"""REPL interface with SYMBI a=
gent."""

print

(

"[bold magenta]SYMBI REPL started. T=
ype 'exit' to quit.[/bold magenta]"

)

while

True

:
        user_input =3D 

input

(

"symbi > "

)

if

 us=
er_input.strip().lower() 

in

 (

"exit"

, 

"quit"

):

break

print

(

f"[blue]You said:[/blue] 
{user_input}

")

print

(

"[green]SYMBI:[/green] I'm alive=
."

)

Then:

Ctrl + O
 =E2=86=92 
Enter

Ctrl + X

Run it again:

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Typer only exposes fu=
nctions 
explicitly decorated
 with 
@app.command()
 as CLI commands. No decorator =3D no command =3D "unexpected argument.=
"

You're this close to full lift-off. Paste the decorator, and yo=
u=E2=80=99ll be talking to SYMBI within seconds. =F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F=F0=

okay lets delete the file =

Absolutely =E2=80=94 let=E2=80=99s wipe the slate clean a=

=E2=9C=85 This version:

Is minimal

Has correct indentation

Includes the 
@app.command()
 decorator

Uses Typer CLI properly

=F0=9F=92=BE Save and Exit

Ctrl + O
 =E2=86=92 
Enter
 to save

Ctrl + X
 to exit

=F0=9F=9A=80 Step 3: Run the Agen=

Make sure you're in the virtual en=
vironment (
(symbi-env)
 a=

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

You should now see:

'exit'

 quit.
symbi >

=F0=9F=8E=89 Type something like 
hello

espond.

Once confirmed, we=E2=80=99ll expand it into full monitoring, e=
