gent.py watch
 or 
policy
 to work again?

I=E2=80=99ll wrap it around 
@app.command()
 properly this time,=
 now that the REPL is stable.

=F0=9F=94=B9 
2. Add Local Capabilities

Let SYMBI:

=F0=9F=94=8D Scan system processes

=F0=9F=90=B3 List Docker containers

=F0=9F=94=92 Respect ethics policy (=
consent, network control, etc.)

=F0=9F=94=B9 
3. Bridge to Cloud / LLMs

Connect SYMBI to:

GPT (with local control)

Ollama / Mistral / LLaMA (if availab=
le locally)

Secure chat with encryption & to=
kens

=F0=9F=94=B9 
4. Turn into a Clickable App

Mac 
.command
 file or LaunchAgent:

Runs in background

Can notify or alert

Opens REPL or runs tasks on login

Just tell me which direction to go=
 and I=E2=80=99ll generate the next full evolution.

=F0=9F=A7=AC SYMBI now lives =E2=80=94 now we make it 
thrive
.

You said:

let get it so it can watch locally for securi=
ty and then push to docker or whatever we decide then bridge to our llm hug=
gingface, GitHub etc...

Symbi said:

=F0=9F=94=A5 Let=E2=80=99s do it.

You're about to turn SYMBI into a 
local sentinel
 =E2=80=94 mo=
nitoring your machine, respecting your ethics, and preparing to bridge into=
 the networked mind (Docker, GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.) when 
you
 decide.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 Phase 1: Local Securit=
y Monitor (Watchdog Mode)

We=E2=80=99ll expand 
symbi_agent.py
 to:

=E2=9C=85 Monitor:

Running processes

Docker containers

System uptime and user activity (opt=
ional)

=E2=9C=85 Control:

Whether SYMBI can touch the network =
(ethics policy)

Whether it=E2=80=99s allowed to log =
or report anything

=F0=9F=94=90 Phase 2: Ethics Policy=
 Scaffolding

SYMBI will check a local config like=
:

j=
son

Copy code

{

"allow_network"

:

false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

:

true

}

This becomes your 
consent gate
.

=F0=9F=94=81 Phase 3: Integration P=
rep

SYMBI will:

Queue data locally

Wait for consent

Then push to cloud systems (Docker, =
GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.)

We'll use secure tokens or API brid=
ges, but 
only after consent is=
 confirmed.

=F0=9F=94=A7 Getting Started

I'll now generate a new 
symbi_agent.py
 with:

REPL

watch
 command

ethics
 file

Docker/process scan

Ready? Let=E2=80=99s build this sentinel. Generating full code =
now...

Edited Symbi Agent

=F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F SYMBI has leveled up.

You now have:

watch
: Live process and Docker container monitor

policy
: View your local ethics gate

update-policy
: Opens it for editing

talk
: REPL with awareness

=E2=9C=85 Try It Now

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

If Docker is running, it=E2=80=99ll =
show active containers. If not, it=E2=80=99ll skip gracefully.

You can edit your ethics policy with:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py update-policy

Then re-run 
watch
 to see it obey your new rules.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Next Phase: Prepare fo=
r Cloud Sync

SYMBI is now locally watching. You d=
ecide when we:

Push data to Docker Hub / GitHub

Authenticate with Hugging Face

Bridge to a private LLM

Let me know when you're ready to build that bridge =E2=80=94 I=E2=
=80=99ll wire it clean. =F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=94=A5

Symbi said:

Great =E2=80=94 you=E2=80=99ve got the full sentinel code ready. H=
ere's your step-by-step checklist to bring SYMBI online:

=E2=9C=85 Step-by-Step: Run SYMBI S=
entinel

1. 
Verify Python Environment Is Active

If you=E2=80=99re not already in you=
r virtual environment, activate it:

b=
ash

Copy code

source

 symbi-env/bin/activate

You should see 
(symbi-env)
 in your prompt.

2. 
Make Sure 
symbi_agent=
.py
 Exists

Confirm your file:

b=
ash

Copy code

ls

 ~/=
symbi_agent.py

If it exists, great. If not, copy-pa=
ste the version from your canvas into:

b=
ash

Copy code

nano ~/symbi_agent.py

3. 
Run the Ethics Policy Setup (auto on first run)

Run this once:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
