false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"allow_process_monitoring"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

}

If this works, your config is set.

4. 
Monitor Local Security

Run:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

This checks:

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Running processes

=F0=9F=90=B3 Docker containers (if=
 Docker is installed & running)

If 
allow_container_scans
 is 
false
 in your policy, it will skip that part.

5. 
Edit Your Ethics Policy (optional)

To update permissions:

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py update-policy

It will open the 
.json
 file. Change values like:

json

Copy code

"allow_network"

:

=

true

Then save and rerun 
watch
.

6. 
REPL Mode (just for talking)

Run:

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

SYMBI will greet you and let you t=
ype. This is where we'll later plug in LLMs, local actions, or voice interf=
aces.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 Next Milestone

Once this all works, we'll:

Add 
data queueing and report bundling

Allow 
secure cloud bridging
 (GitHub, Hugging Face, etc=
.)

Integrate 
LLM-powered response modes

Let me know where you are in the steps =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ll w=
alk you forward from there. =F0=9F=91=81=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=94=A5

Perfect =E2=80=94 yo=
u=E2=80=99re inside your 
symbi-env
, ready to run the agent. Here's 
exactly what to do next
, step by step:

=E2=9C=85 
Step 1: View the Ethics Policy

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

You should see the JSON output like =
this:

j=
son

Copy code

{

"allow_network"

:

false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"allow_process_monitoring"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

:

true

}

If that prints correctly =E2=80=94 y=
our config is loaded and working =E2=9C=85

=E2=9C=85 
Step 2: Run the Security Watch Command

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

You should see:

A list of running system processes

(Optional) Docker containers if Dock=
er is installed and running

If Docker isn't installed, you=E2=80=
=99ll see:

c=
ss

Copy code

=

[yellow]

Docker=
 not found. Skipping container check.

[/yellow]

This is expected and clean =E2=80=94=
 no error, just a skip.

=E2=9C=85 
Step 3: Try REPL Mode

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

You=E2=80=99ll get:

p=
gsql

Copy code

=

SYMBI REPL started. 

Type

'exit'

to

=
 quit.
symbi >

Type something like:

nginx

Copy code

hello

And it=E2=80=99ll echo back with S=
YMBI=E2=80=99s response.

=F0=9F=9B=A0 Optional: Edit the P=
olicy

Want to enable network functions l=
ater?

bash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Then change 
"allow_network": false
 to 
true
 if you want SYMBI to push to GitHub/Hug=
gingFace later.

Let me know after Step 2 runs =E2=80=94 and we=E2=80=99ll start=
 building the cloud integration bridge (e.g. Hugging Face auth, Docker push=
, GitHub commit). =F0=9F=A7=A0=F0=9F=9B=B0=EF=B8=8F

Perfect signal recei=
ved: you're inside the virtual environment, but the command:

ba=
sh

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

unexpectedly launched 
REPL mode
 instead. This means:

=E2=9D=97 Your command-line argumen=
ts are being ignored

...most likely because you're callin=
g 
symbi_agent.py
 with 
python
, but 
typer
 isn't correctly resolving the CLI ro=
uting.

=E2=9C=85 Quick Fix

Try calling it with the 
-m
 module flag:
