ly there =E2=80=94 the only issue now is that your 
python3
 environment doesn't have=
 the required packages (
rich
, 
typer
, 
psutil
) installed outside the virtualenv.=

Since you're using a virtual environ=
ment called 
symbi-env
, 
you need to use the 
python3
 binary from inside that env
 =E2=80=94 not the global 
/op=
t/homebrew/bin/python3
.

=E2=9C=85 Fix in One Shot:

1. Reactivate Your Virtual Environm=
ent

b=
ash

Copy code

source

 ~/symbi-env/bin/activate

You should see:

b=
ash

Copy code

(symbi-env) SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$

2. Reinstall the Requirements (insi=
de venv)

b=
ash

Copy code

pip install rich typer psutil

3. Run SYMBI Again

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

=E2=9C=85 Once that works, you can r=
un:

watch
 =E2=80=94 for monitoring

talk
 =E2=80=94 for REPL

update_policy
 =E2=80=94 to change behavior

Would you like me to also generate a=

requirements.txt
 and 
install.sh
 so you can bootstra=
p this on any machine in one line later?

Let=E2=80=99s confirm this part works first. Then we go deeper. =

Perfect p=
rogress =E2=80=94 SYMBI is fully operational, but you=E2=80=99ve just disco=
vered something subtle:

=F0=9F=94=8D Problem: Every command =
you run (e.g. 
policy
, 
watch
) is going into REPL mode=
 instead of the CLI mode.

Why? Because you're typing:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

But the current script is interpreti=
ng that 
as if you ran 
talk

.

=E2=9C=85 Fix: We Need to Reorder t=
he Default Mode

Let=E2=80=99s separate:

CLI commands
: 
w=
atch
, 
policy
, 
update_policy

REPL mode
: only when explicitly run

Right now, every 
python ...
 command just launches the REPL, be=
cause the 
talk()
 function =
is probably overriding the CLI parser unintentionally.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What To Do

I=E2=80=99ll update the script right=
 now so:

CLI commands work like:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

REPL runs only when you say:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

Give me 5 seconds... =F0=9F=94=A7

Edited Symbi Agen=
t

=E2=9C=85 Don=
e: SYMBI now cleanly separates REPL from CLI commands.

=F0=9F=A7=AA Try This Now

=F0=9F=94=B9 For CLI Commands

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

These will now show JSON or system i=
nfo as expected.

=F0=9F=94=B9 For REPL Mode

If you just run:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py

Then it enters the SYMBI REPL automa=
tically:

n=
ginx

Copy code

=

symbi

You're fully back on track. Want to start building the cloud brid=
ge next (GitHub, HuggingFace, LLM integration)? Just say the word. =F0=9F=

 REPL mode now =E2=80=94 which means SYMBI is listening.

Here=E2=80=99s 
what you can do next
, and how to move forward=
:

=E2=9C=85 What You Can Do 
Now
 in REPL Mode

REPL is currently minimal =E2=80=94 =
it just echoes input. Try typing:

b=
ash

Copy code

exit

This exits the REPL and brings you b=
ack to the terminal.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What You 
Probably Meant
 to Do

You likely wanted to run a CLI comma=
nd like:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

or:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

But since you launched 
without arguments
, you entered REPL=
 (
talk()
 is default when n=
o CLI args are passed).

=F0=9F=A7=AD From Here: What You Sh=
ould Do Now

1. =E2=9D=8C Exit the REPL:

b=
ash

Copy code

exit
