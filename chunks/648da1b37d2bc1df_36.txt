ommands:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch
python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Then SYMBI will operate in sentinel =
mode and obey the ethics policy.

=F0=9F=94=9C Then: Ready for Cloud =
Bridge

Once SYMBI is running and watching =
locally, we can build:

push-to-github

sync-with-huggingface

llm-bridge
 (local/remote chat)

Let me know what direction you wan=
t next:

=F0=9F=93=A1 GitHub integration

=F0=9F=A4=97 Hugging Face upload

Perfect =E2=80=94 thanks f=
or confirming you're still running the previous version.

You're exactly right: 
since 
python symbi_agent.py
 had no CLI args
, this line at the bo=
ttom:

p=
ython

Copy code

if

 =

len

(sys.argv=
) =3D=3D 

1

:

# No CLI args =E2=86=92 defau=
lt to REPL

    talk()

...automatically launches REPL.

=E2=9C=85 What To Do Now

=F0=9F=94=A7 Step 1: Update the Fil=
e

Open it again:

b=
ash

Copy code

nano ~/symbi_agent.py

Then 
replace just the bottom section
:

=F0=9F=94=81 Change this:

p=
ython

Copy code

if

 =
__name__ =3D=3D 

"__main__"

:

import

 sy=
s

if

len

(sys.argv) =3D=
=3D 

1

:

# No CLI args =E2=86=92 d=
efault to REPL

        talk()

else

:

# CLI args provided =E2=
=86=92 use typer commands

        app()

=E2=9C=85 To this:

p=
ython

Copy code

if

 =
__name__ =3D=3D 

"__main__"

:
    app()

That=E2=80=99s it.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Step 2: Run the CLI ag=
ain

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

Now it 
will not default to REPL
 =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99ll ex=
ecute your CLI command properly.

Let me know once that=E2=80=99s done =E2=80=94 and I=E2=80=99ll =
scaffold the next phase (cloud syncing, GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.) =F0=9F=

Amazing =E2=80=94 SYMBI is running in CLI mode now, and=
 it=E2=80=99s correctly displaying your 
ethics policy
. You=E2=80=99re fully operational as a local=
 sentinel.

Now let's clean up and push to the n=
ext stage.

=E2=9C=85 Final Cleanup

Since everything is working smoothly=
 with CLI commands now, let=E2=80=99s remove this redundant REPL fallback:

=F0=9F=94=A7 In your code, replace:=

p=
ython

Copy code

if

 =
__name__ =3D=3D 

"__main__"

:

import

 sy=
s

if

len

(sys.argv) =3D=
=3D 

1

:

# No CLI args =E2=86=92 d=
efault to REPL

        talk()

else

:

# CLI args provided =E2=
=86=92 use typer commands

        app()

=E2=9C=85 With this:

p=
ython

Copy code

if

 =
__name__ =3D=3D 

"__main__"

:
    app()

This ensures SYMBI only runs via exp=
licit CLI commands (
talk
, =

watch
, 
policy
, etc.) and won't auto-launch REPL.

Let me know when that=E2=80=99s done=
 and I=E2=80=99ll drop in the blueprint for:

=F0=9F=9A=80 Phase 2: Secure Cloud =
Bridge Options

You=E2=80=99ll be able to choose:

 =F0=9F=93=A1 Push updates to GitHub

 =F0=9F=A4=97 Sync models to Hugging Face

 =F0=9F=A7=A0 Query LLMs securely (local or via API)

 =F0=9F=A7=B0 Docker image scans + automation

SYMBI=E2=80=99s evolving =E2=80=94 your call on where it grows =
next.
