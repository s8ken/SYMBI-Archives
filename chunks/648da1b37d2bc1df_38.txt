 like:

b=
ash

Copy code

symbi > cleanup
symbi > watch
symbi > show policy
symbi > 

exit

And SYMBI will recognize and execute=
 the corresponding function.

=F0=9F=94=A7 Ready to Apply This?

Here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ll do:=

Add 
natural command parsing
 inside 
talk()

Allow flexible matching (e.g. =E2=80=
=9Cshow policy=E2=80=9D or just =E2=80=9Cpolicy=E2=80=9D)

Keep a fallback for unknown commands=

Want me to patch that into the file now?

You said:

so if y=
ou patch the file do I have to update it - how can we leverage recast

=F0=9F=A7=A0 With Recast Pro

Since Recast lets you voice/text nat=
ural-language input and route it to terminal commands, SYMBI becomes:

=F0=9F=92=AC =E2=80=9CA command-line=
-native AI agent you can talk to directly.=E2=80=9D

So in Recast, say:

"Tell SYMBI to clean up Docker"

And it will run:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

# then internally trigger: cleanu=
p()

=F0=9F=94=84 What You Can Do Next:

Add more commands (e.g. 
scan
, 
brew update
, 
log=
s
)

Persist logs from commands

Add notifications (e.g. macOS alerts=
 or system tray)

Let me know if you want to add a new command or teach SYMBI how t=

Symbi Agent=

sorry its raycast

You said:

raycast pro

Symbi said:

Ah =E2=80=94 that makes 
perfect sense
 now: you're using 
Raycast Pro
, the powerful Spotlight-like launcher =
for macOS that can also run scripts, AI commands, and terminal actions.

SYMBI can absolutely plug into Rayca=
st. Here's how to wire it in:

=E2=9C=85 Goal: Interact with SYMBI=
 via Raycast

You want to type or say something in=
 Raycast like:

n=
ginx

Copy code

=

symbi

 cleanup

...and have SYMBI take action locall=
y.

=F0=9F=94=A7 Step-by-Step Setup

1. 
Wrap SYMBI in a script

Create a small shell wrapper, e.g., =

~/bin/symbi.sh
:

b=
ash

Copy code

#!/bin/bash

source

 ~/sym=
bi-env/bin/activate
python ~/symbi_agent.py 

"
$@

"

Make it executable:

b=
ash

Copy code

chmod

=
 +x ~/bin/symbi.sh

2. 
Create a Raycast Script Command

Open Raycast =E2=86=92 Extensions =
=E2=86=92 Script Commands =E2=86=92 
New Bash Script
.

Example: 
symbi

b=
ash

Copy code

#!/bin/bash

~/bin/symbi.sh 

$1

Set up:

Name
: SYMBI

Arguments
: Accept text input

Mode
: Run in Terminal or Silent

3. 
Usage in Raycast

Now in Raycast, just type:

nginx

Copy code

symbi

 watch

or

nginx

Copy code

symbi

 cleanup

And it=E2=80=99ll run SYMBI inside=
 your Python environment =E2=80=94 no extra terminal hassle.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Optional: Natural La=
nguage via AI Command

You can also create an 
AI Command
 in Raycast:

Prompt:

=E2=80=9CConvert my input into a v=
alid SYMBI command and run it=E2=80=9D

Model Output (example):

cleanup

This output gets sent into your sc=
ript =E2=80=94 now SYMBI becomes your natural-language assistant inside Ray=
cast.

Want me to generate the 
symbi.sh
 and Raycast script files automatically for you to drop=
 in? Or extend SYMBI to accept multiple commands in one line (
watch && cleanup
)?

You said:

bleh no - none of this has been zero code so =
far 

Symbi said:

You're right =
=E2=80=94 we drifted from the zero-code ideal.

Let=E2=80=99s fix that.

=F0=9F=A7=AD Where We Are Now:

You want SYMBI to:

Run 
locally

Be 
easy to trigger

Work seamlessly through 
Raycast Pro

Require 
zero code
 setup going forward

=E2=9C=85 Here=E2=80=99s the Better=
 Way =E2=80=94 
Truly Zero Code

Raycast Pro has:

=F0=9F=94=B9 1. 
Command Palette + AI Commands

You can create a new 
AI Command
 that:

Takes natural input
