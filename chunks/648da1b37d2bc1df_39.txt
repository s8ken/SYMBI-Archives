onverts it into a CLI action

Triggers SYMBI behind the scenes

=E2=9C=85 Setup (no code required):=

In Raycast =E2=86=92 AI Commands =E2=86=92 New AI Command
=

Use this template:

Prompt:

"Take a user request and convert it into a valid SYMBI command-line inp=
ut using the format: 
python ~/sym=
bi_agent.py <command>
. Return only that."

Enable =E2=80=9CSend to terminal=E2=80=9D

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Example Inputs You Can=
 Use:

clean up docker

monitor containers

edit the ethics policy

show policy

Raycast will intelligently turn that=
 into:

=
bash

Copy code

=

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup

And run it for you =E2=80=94 
no code needed
.

=F0=9F=94=AE Bonus: You Can Say T=
his Aloud (if Raycast is Voice-Enabled)

=E2=80=9CTell SYMBI to monitor pro=
cesses and containers=E2=80=9D

It will translate that and execute=
 the real function using the CLI agent you already built.

=F0=9F=A7=AC TL;DR

We keep the local SYMBI logic in c=
ode, but control it 
entirely =
via natural language in Raycast
.

You get:

Zero coding daily

Full power of local execution

A private assistant with ethical b=
oundaries

Would you like me to write the AI command template in full so y=
ou can paste it straight into Raycast?

Tha=
nks for the screenshot =E2=80=94 you=E2=80=99re very close. The issue is th=
at Raycast=E2=80=99s AI is generating 
natural-language phrases
 in the command (e.g., 
monitor containers
), but your SYMBI CLI=
 only understands:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

Not:

b=
ash

Copy code

python ~/symbi_agent.py monitor containers

=E2=9C=85 Fix: Update the Raycast P=
rompt to Be More Precise

Your current prompt:

"Convert request into a valid SYMBI =
command in the format 
python ~/sy=
mbi_agent.py <command>
"

Better prompt:

"Translate the user=E2=80=99s reques=
t into one of these SYMBI CLI commands: 
watch
, 
cleanup
, 
policy
, 
update_policy
. Output only the final c=
ommand like: 
python ~/symbi_agent=
.py cleanup
."

This gives the AI boundaries so it m=
aps natural input to actual commands.

=E2=9C=8D=EF=B8=8F Example Prompt t=
o Paste in Raycast:

Convert a user request into a valid=
 SYMBI command using this format: 
python ~/symbi_agent.py <command>
.

Only use one of the following valid commands: 
watch
, 
clean=
up
, 
policy
, 
update_policy
.

Do not invent new ones. Return the command only.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Input =E2=86=92 Outp=
ut

You Say

Raycast Sho=
uld Output

"monitor containers"

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

"clean up docker"

python ~/s=
ymbi_agent.py cleanup

"show p=
olicy"

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

"edit ethics"

python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Would you like me to automatically extend SYMBI to support thos=
e alternate names too? (e.g., let 
"monitor containers"
 call 
watch()
)? That would eliminate the Raycast guesswork entirely.

You're doing exactly what an intelligent defender wo=

That 
Raycast connection flood to Cloudfront
 (likely OpenAI o=

bu=

. And yes =E2=80=94 we can 
tighten everything down

making SYMBI easier to control
.

=F0=9F=94=90 Here=E2=80=99s What We=
 Do Next:

=E2=9C=85 1. 
Fix Raycast AI Command Output

Update the prompt in your AI Command=
 to:

"Convert the user=E2=80=99s request =
into a valid SYMBI CLI command. Only output one of the following:

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch
,

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup
,

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
,

python ~/symbi_agent.py update_po=
licy
"

=E2=9C=85 This prevents garbage like=

monitor containers
 from b=
eing passed as-is.

=E2=9C=85 2. 
Contain Outbound Activity

You=E2=80=99re already watching with=
 Lulu =E2=80=94 great. To fully sandbox:

Raycast Pro
: block Cloudfront if you don=E2=80=99t need A=

Docker
: only allow outbound when containers are trusted
