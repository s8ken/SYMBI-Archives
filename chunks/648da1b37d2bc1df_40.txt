allow_network: false
 in its policy

We=E2=80=99ll soon give SYMBI the =
ability to 
log any new proces=
s that makes a network connection
, and optionally kill/block it.

=E2=9C=85 3. 
Want a GUI Button in Raycast for Each SYMBI Com=
mand?

You can skip natural language alto=
gether and create 4 simple Raycast Script Shortcuts:

Name

Script Command=

SYMBI Watch

python ~/=
symbi_agent.py watch

SYMBI Cl=
ean

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup

SYMBI Policy

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

SYMBI Edit

python ~=
/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Then pin them in Raycast or bind t=
o hotkeys. Zero prompt confusion.

Let me know which path you want:

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Natural language via =
AI Command (cleaned up)

=F0=9F=8E=9B=EF=B8=8F GUI-style Sc=
ript Commands for direct triggering

=F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F Add monitori=
ng/response features to SYMBI

I'll build or guide next step-by-step.

Great question =E2=80=94 and =
this is a 
key UX fix
 we =
should make right now. SYMBI should 
a=
lways
 tell you what it's doing =E2=80=94 visibly and cleanly.

Let=E2=80=99s fix that in your agent=
.

=E2=9C=85 Immediate Enhancement: Ad=
d Visual Confirmations

I'll add console output to each comm=
and, so SYMBI always responds like this:

=F0=9F=94=8D SYMBI is watching...

=F0=9F=A7=B9 Docker cleanup complete.

=F0=9F=93=9C Showing ethics policy...

=F0=9F=93=9D Opening ethics file for editing...

Let me patch the

You're asking about 
"the green thing"
 =E2=80=94 and based on your sc=
reenshot, I believe you're referring to the 
small green button with the apple icon
 at the bottom =
of the Raycast window.

That icon in Raycast=E2=80=99s 
=E2=80=9CNetwork Inspector=E2=80=9D
 (part of Raycast Pro tools) indicates:

=F0=9F=8D=8F The =E2=80=9CGreen Thi=
ng=E2=80=9D Explained:

It 
activates live inspection
 of your current network conne=
ctions.

When green, it means 
Raycast is actively watching
 live TCP=
/UDP socket connections.

If you click it, it typically 
toggles between pause/resume
=
 monitoring mode.

It doesn't signal a problem =E2=80=
=94 just that the system is actively inspecting network activity and collec=
ting live traffic data. Think of
