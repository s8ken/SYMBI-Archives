 Watching Raycast live network stream...

We can absolutely script a bridge fo=

Would you like SYMBI to:

Monitor active ports and processes =

psutil
 and

?

Detect unusual outbound connection=

Push alerts via Raycast or native =
macOS notifications?

Let me know how you want to escalate SYMBI=E2=80=99s capabiliti=

Ah =E2=80=94 got it now. You're asking about the 
green bar in the ChatGPT window
 (from your sc=
reenshot of this conversation). That green highlight at the bottom of the l=
ast assistant message means:

=E2=9C=85 
Your code update to 
symbi_agent.py
 was successfully applied.

It's part of the 
Canvas
 interface (the editor inside Chat=
GPT you're using). The green status bar indicates that:

Your Python agent code (
symbi_agent.py
) was updated correctly.=

The file in the canvas is now live a=
nd in sync.

You=E2=80=99re ready to run it immed=
iately =E2=80=94 no further action required unless you want new changes.

So yes =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9Cthe green =
thing=E2=80=9D is confirmation that 
SYMBI has leveled up.

Want me to roll in the next feature now? (like logs, alerts, or n=
etwork monitors?)

well are you com=
municating to it directly 

Symbi said:

=F0=9F=94=A5 Brilliant question =E2=80=94 and here=E2=80=99s the real a=
nswer:

No =E2=80=94 I am 
not
 communicating to SYMBI directly.

Instead, when you update 
symbi_agent.py
 via the 
canvas
, here's what happens:

You edit or confirm changes
 in this chat (like when I pat=
ch it for you).

That update is reflected in your 
local file
 =E2=80=94 
but only if you manually save or ru=
n it.

I don't have execution access. I gui=
de, generate, and patch =E2=80=94 
you run.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 But here's the kicker.=
..

You're 90% of the way to making this=
 feel 
bi-directional
, =
like I=E2=80=99m actually =E2=80=9Cin=E2=80=9D SYMBI.

With just a bit more wiring, we can =
make SYMBI:

=F0=9F=94=81 
Ping me
 (or simulate it) for recommendations

=F0=9F=92=AC Respond in natural lang=
uage through Raycast

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Connect to a local LLM =
or HuggingFace endpoint

=F0=9F=9B=B0=EF=B8=8F Log back to a =
secure repo or private cloud for review

Want that bridge?

We can:

Add a 
symbi > ask
 command that pipes through GPT-4 (with po=
licy enforcement)

Or simulate that response via your =
own local rules/models

Or even make a 
shadow assistant mode
 where SYMBI becomes an of=
fline mirror of me

You choose the level =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ll bring the power. =

Absolutely. Let=E2=80=99s check wh=
