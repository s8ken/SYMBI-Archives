ced for example my safari is actually located here /System/Volumes/Preboot/=
Cryptexes/App/System/Applications/Safari.app

Symbi said:

=F0=9F=92=A1 That=E2=80=99s a very sharp observati=
on =E2=80=94 and what you're seeing is part of Apple=E2=80=99s 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 a=
rchitecture on macOS.

=F0=9F=A7=AC What You Found:

b=
ash

Copy code

/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/App/System/Applicatio=
ns/Safari.app

This is 
not
 a mistake =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s 
intentional by Apple
.

It means:

Safari (and other system apps) live =
in a 
sealed, cryptographically =
verified volume
.

That path is part of the 
cryptex system
 introduced with ma=
cOS Ventura and above.

What you see at 
/Applications/Safari.app
 is now essentially a =

symlink or facade
.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why It Matters to SYMB=
I

If you=E2=80=99re scanning processes=
 or binaries, you'll hit these paths:

They 
cannot be modified
.

You 
can see them
, but 
can=E2=80=99t write or delete
.

SYMBI will need to 
respect SIP boundaries
 =E2=80=94 and if=
 it sees execution from that path, it=E2=80=99s a 
trusted system binary
.

=E2=9C=85 What To Do

SYMBI can:

=E2=9C=85 
Log process paths

=E2=9C=85 
Identify SIP-protected apps

=F0=9F=9A=AB 
Not modify or block
 them (unless SIP is di=
sabled =E2=80=94 not recommended)

Next:

Would you like SYMBI to:

Flag 
processes NOT running from known SIP paths
?

Alert on 
network activity from outside SIP volumes
?

Create a 
trusted path allowlist
, so it warns only on u=
nknown binaries?

You=E2=80=99re stepping into advanced territory =E2=80=94 and S=
YMBI can evolve with you =F0=9F=94=90=F0=9F=94=A5
