=E2=98=81=EF=B8=8F What Is a VPS?

A 
VPS (Virtual Private Server)
 is a private virtual machine=
 running in the cloud.

It gives you 
full control
 like your own server =E2=80=94 without managing hardware.

You can:

Install anything (Docker, Python, SY=
MBI, databases, etc.)

Host APIs, agents, websites, service=
s

Run continuously =E2=80=94 24/7

Lock it down: firewall, encryption, =
logs

Avoid GitHub, Vercel, or BigTech int=
egrations if you want

Think of it as:

=F0=9F=A7=B1
