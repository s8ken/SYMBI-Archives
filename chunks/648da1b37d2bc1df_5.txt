tells Docker to open port 80
 on the container. This means=
:

The container is 
configured to serve HTTP traffic
, usuall=
y via something like 
NGINX
, 
Apache
, or anoth=
er web server.

It's a signal to any orchestration o=
r networking tools (like 
docker r=
un -p
, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes) that 
=E2=80=9Cthis is the port you probably want to forward.=
=E2=80=9D

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Important Clarif=
ication

EXPOSE does 
not
 autom=
atically publish the port to the outside world.

Here=E2=80=99s the difference:

Command

What it does

EXPOSE 80
 (in Dockerfil=
e)

Declare=
s intent. Makes port 80 available 
w=
ithin the container network
.

docker run -p 80:80

Actually publishes th=
e port to your 
host
, m=
aking it accessible 
from outsid=
e
.

So unless 
someone ran the container with 
-p 80:80
 or similar
, the port is not reacha=
ble from the outside world.

You can verify this with:

=
bash

Copy code

docker ps

If the 
PORTS
 column is empty (like it was in your first po=
st), then 
nothing is exposed =
externally.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 Why Is This Insecure=
 If Misused?

If you had started this container =
with:

bash

Copy code

docker run -p 80:80 ...

...then:

It would expose a 
possibly vulnerable NGINX server
 to =
the internet.

If the server=E2=80=99s config or =
Alpine base had security flaws, you could be vulnerable to:

RCE (Remote Code Execution)

DoS attacks

Information leaks

Or worse: container escape or late=
ral movement on your host.

=F0=9F=A7=B0 Safe Practice

If you're building containers:

Only 
EXPOSE
 ports that 
must
 be used.

Use 
firewalls
 or 
Docker network segmentation
 to control access.

Avoid 
-p
 unless you 
trust
 the container and have it hardened.

=E2=9C=85 Want to Take Action?

We can:

Build a 
secure, minimal container
 that doesn=E2=80=99t=
 expose anything unless you choose to.

Wrap it in a 
docker-compose.yml
 with explicit network rule=
s.

Add a 
reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
 and access control.

Vulnerability:

CVE-2024-5535

CVSS Score:

9.1

(Critical)

This vulnerability exists in version=
s 
older than 3.1.6-r0
.=

The 
fix version
 exists =E2=80=94 but the image you're usin=
g hasn=E2=80=99t been updated to include it.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F What=E2=80=99s t=
he Risk?

CVE-2024-5535
 is a 
critical flaw
 in the 
=
OpenSSL crypto library
 included in Alpine.

That means:

Anything using cryptography inside t=
hat container (HTTPS, JWTs, etc.) 
may be exploitable
.

It 
does not need to be in use directly
 =E2=80=94 sometimes=
 just having the vulnerable package in the image is enough for an attacker =
to find a path.

Even if your app doesn=E2=80=99t us=
e OpenSSL explicitly, many tools (like 
wget
, 
curl
,=

git
, etc.) do =E2=80=94=
 which expands the attack surface.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why Is This in the I=
mage?

Because:

The 
base image
 (layer 5, as shown) is using an 
outdated Alpine version
.

Specifically, a version with OpenS=
SL 
< 3.1.6-r0
.

Since this image is 
2 years old
, it predates the vulne=
rability disclosure.

=F0=9F=9B=A0=EF=B8=8F What You Sh=
ould Do

If you=E2=80=99re building your ow=
n containers:

Use a newer base image
:

dockerfile

Copy code

FROM alpine:3.20

or a fresh NGINX build:

dockerfile

Copy code

FROM nginx:1.25.3-alpine

Run updates during the build
 (for Alpine):

dockerfile

Copy code

RUN apk update && apk upgrade

Use Docker Scout or Trivy in CI/CD
 to scan every build=
.

Avoid long-lived containers
