 going to deploy it to 
Railway
 =E2=80=94 a cloud pla=
tform that:

Hosts containerized web services

Gives you a public HTTPS endpoint (l=
ike 
https://symbi.up.railway.app
)

Handles all the infrastructure =E2=
=80=94 no config files or DevOps needed

This means you=E2=80=99ll be able =
to 
trigger SYMBI from your br=
owser, Raycast, iPad, or automation tools.

=E2=9C=85 Step 3: Your Actions Ri=
ght Now

Here=E2=80=99s what you need to do=
 =E2=80=94 I'll walk with you:

1. Create a folder for deployment=

bash

Copy code

mkdir

 ~/symbi-cloud && 

cd

 ~/symbi-cloud

2. Download the agent code into t=
hat folder

Paste in 
symbi_api.py
 I just built (let me know if you'd l=
ike a downloadable link or I=E2=80=99ll guide you to copy-paste again).

3. Add a 
Dockerfile
 (I'll generate this next)

This tells Railway how to run your=
 agent.

=E2=8F=AD=EF=B8=8F What Happens N=
ext

Once you have that folder ready, I=
=E2=80=99ll give you:

A 
Dockerfile

The Railway deployment steps

The actual deploy button/command

=F0=9F=94=81 Your job is to 
only follow the step in front of you
. Ready for step 4 (Dockerf=
ile)?

You said:

okay no y=
ou already have me entering code - I will start in railway where it is aski=
ng me where we are deploying the new project

Symbi said:

=E2=9C=85 Perfect. Let=E2=80=99s 
start from the Railway GUI
 =E2=80=94 no co=
de yet. You're on the right track.

=F0=9F=8E=9B=EF=B8=8F RAILWAY GUI DE=
PLOY =E2=80=94 Step-by-Step

When Railway asks:

=E2=80=9CWhere is your code?=E2=80=9D

You=E2=80=99ll see several options:

Option

What It Means

What You Choose

GitHub Repo

Deploy from a repo (you don=E2=80=99t want this)

=E2=9D=8C Not for now

Deploy from Template

Use a prebuilt example

=E2=9D=8C Not needed

Start Empty Proj=
ect

Manual deploy (what we want)

=E2=9C=85 YES =E2=80=94 Choose this

=

=

=E2=9C=85 Step 1: Click =E2=80=9C
Start Empty Project
=E2=
=80=9D

Railway will now open your project d=
ashboard with nothing inside yet. This is where we will 
connect your code
 next.

=E2=9C=B3=EF=B8=8F You should now s=
ee:

A blank project

Tabs like:

Deployments

Settings

Plugins

That means you=E2=80=99re ready to 
connect code manually.

=F0=9F=94=84 Step 2: Add a Service

You=E2=80=99ll now:

Click the 
New
 or 
Add
 button

Choose 
=E2=80=9CDeploy from Dockerfile=E2=80=9D

(If asked for repo or CLI, we=E2=
=80=99ll use the 
Railway CLI
 to deploy local code next =E2=80=94 very easy.)

=F0=9F=91=89 Before we continue:

Are you in the 
empty project dashboard
 now?

Do you see the 
option to deploy from CLI or Dockerfile
?

If so, we=E2=80=99ll install the CLI and push SYMBI up. Shall w=
e continue?

You said:

yes I am in the empty project dashboard and want to ensure I am using dock=
er cloud. in railway it has docker image as an option

Symbi said:

=F0=9F=92=AF Perfect =E2=80=94 you=E2=80=
=99re in exactly the right spot.

=E2=9C=85 Your Decision: 
=E2=80=9CDocker Image=E2=80=9D Option in Ra=
ilway

That option expects:

A 
public Docker image
 from a registry (like Docker Hub)

OR a private one with auth tokens

But: you don=E2=80=99t have a SYMBI =
Docker image 
yet
 =E2=80=94 it=
=E2=80=99s 
on your local machin=
e
 as raw Python.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 So You Have Two Paths:=

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option A: =E2=80=9CDoc=
ker Image=E2=80=9D

You=E2=80=99d:

Manually 
build the SYMBI Docker image

Push it to Docker Hub

Paste that image name in Railway

=E2=AC=87=EF=B8=8F Requires:

Docker installed locally

Docker Hub account

CLI use (once)

=E2=9C=85 
Recommended if you want long-term reusability and full co=
ntrol

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option B: Use Railway =
CLI to deploy from local folder

You=E2=80=99d:

Build and deploy 
directly from your machine

No Docker Hub required

Railway handles the containerization=

=E2=AC=87=EF=B8=8F Requires:

Railway CLI installed (1 command)

You run 
railway up
 from project folder

=E2=9C=85 
Easiest for now if you don=E2=80=99t want to use Docker H=
ub
