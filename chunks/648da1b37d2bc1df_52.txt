=E2=9C=85 1. 
GUI Path (GitHub or Manual Zip Upload)

Railway requires 
some way to get your code up
. Without=
 CLI, that means:

Using GitHub
 (which you said you=E2=80=99d rather avoi=
d)

Or 
uploading a Docker image manually
 (more work)

Or having me host a temp GitHub/Gi=
tless repo for you

=E2=9C=85 2. 
Delegate the CLI Once

We use CLI 
just once
 to get SYMBI up =E2=86=92 then all ops mo=
ve to GUI/mobile.

After that:

All interaction is via API or web

Raycast can control everything

You never touch the terminal again=
 (unless you want to)

=F0=9F=94=81 Alternative

Would you prefer I deploy a 
temporary Railway project
 =
for you with SYMBI pre-installed?

Then you:

Take ownership via Railway GUI

Plug in your GPT, Hugging Face, an=
d domain

Evolve from there

=F0=9F=A7=A9 That gives you the 
agent, cloud-native, and GUI-fi=
rst experience right now.

Would you like me to proceed that way instead?

These are your

All of these serve with high cache r=

Suspicious Requests

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What to Do Next

Here=E2=80=99s a suggested 
short action list
 based on =
your goal of security, agent integration, and cloud-native workflow:

=E2=9C=85 1. 
Enable Vercel Firewall Rules

Block 
/wp-admin
, 
/wordpress
, or anything not in your defined route map.

In 
Vercel =E2=86=92 Settings =E2=86=92 Security =E2=86=92 Firew=
all Rules

Add filters to block common WordPr=
ess probes

=E2=9C=85 2. 
Agent Integration (Next Step)

Deploy the 
SYMBI Agent API
 to Railway or as a Vercel E=
dge Function, then wire a dashboard to call it via 
/api/symbi/...
.

=E2=9C=85 3. 
Monitor Behavior

Use Vercel Analytics or integrate =
Plausible/Umami

Detect real human interest vs. bot=
s

=E2=9C=85 4. 
Public-Facing SYMBI?

Do you want the agent to:

Respond to users via a 
/symbi
 chat interface?

Monitor real-world logs?

Or remain local-only for now?

Would you like me to help you 
deploy the agent to Vercel or Railway
 now and expose =
it as an API endpoint so it can start interacting with your web app + infra=
structure?

Symbi said:

The 
/robots.txt
 entry in your logs is 
a signal that bots are scanning your site
 =E2=80=94 and 
following =
protocol
.

=F0=9F=A4=96 What Is 
/robots.txt
?

It=E2=80=99s a 
standardized file
 that tells web crawlers (=

 site they=E2=80=99re allowed or disallowed to acces
