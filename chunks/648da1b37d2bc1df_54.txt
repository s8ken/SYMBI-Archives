Ah =E2=80=94 now that=E2=80=99s the 
right question
. Let's break this down clearly:

=F0=9F=94=8D You Googled something =
=E2=86=92 It showed up in your Vercel logs

You're wondering:

=E2=80=9CDid a bot 
track
 my search and go poke my website?=E2=80=
=9D

Short answer:

Not exactly, but something 
related
 to your action triggered i=
t.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What Actually Happens =
(Step by Step)

1. 
You search on Google (e.g., =E2=80=9Csymbi.world robots.txt=E2=
=80=9D)

Google may 
preload
, 
preview
, or even 
crawl
 results to improve the search experience.

=F0=9F=94=81 Google prefetches or in=
dexes the 
link you searched

=F0=9F=94=8D Googlebot (or another u=
ser=E2=80=99s bot) 
visits that =
URL
 to cache or evaluate it

=E2=86=92 That hits your site and logs a request in Vercel.

2. 
You click the result (or just hover or preview it)

Your 
browser
 or 
Google preview tool
 might:

Request 
favicon.ico
 to show an icon next to the result

Request 
robots.txt
 to check crawlability

Possibly open 
background connections
 to the domain (espec=
ially on mobile or Chrome)

3. 
Background bots, scrapers, and link checkers

After 
you
 interact, 
others might follow
:

Open Graph checkers (Slack, Twitte=
r, etc.)

AI tools probing the domain (espec=
ially new ones)

SEO checkers or bad actors scannin=
g domains

=F0=9F=91=81 Example Timeline:

Say you searched 
symbi.world robots.txt
:

GoogleBot sees that and decides to=
 crawl the site (checking 
/robo=
ts.txt
).

Google Search Results Page shows f=
avicon, so it requests 
/favicon=
.ico
.

If you click the link, 
your browser
 fetches both of th=
ose too.

Behind the scenes, 
any embed, extension, or app
 (Rayca=
st, AI, Discord) might hit your site as well.
