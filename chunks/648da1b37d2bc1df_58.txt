 or similar libraries to quickly add user sign-up, login, and sessio=
n management. This is crucial for a "secure agent/human collab workspace."
- **Realtime**: For live updates in the 
AgentConsole
 (e.g., st=
reaming Symbi's responses, live deployment logs), Supabase Realtime can pro=
vide WebSocket-like functionality without complex server-side setup.
- **Edge Functions**: While your main Symbi agent is on Railway, Supabase E=
dge Functions could host very lightweight, low-latency webhook handlers or =
specific data transformations if needed.

- **"Zero-Code" for User**:

- **Database**: Configure Supabase URL/Key in Railway and Vercel environmen=
t variables. The Python code in Symbi agent uses Supabase client libraries =
for DB operations.
- **Auth**: The Next.js frontend uses Supabase Auth components/hooks. You c=
onfigure providers (email/password, Google, GitHub) in the Supabase dashboa=
rd.
- **Realtime**: Frontend subscribes to Supabase channels. Symbi agent publi=
shes events to these channels.

- **AI-Readable**: All data in Supabase Postgres is inherently structured.

#### 4. Docker

- **Role**: The fundamental containerization technology.
- **Integration**:

- **Symbi Agent Deployment**: Your Symbi FastAPI agent will be containerize=
d using Docker and deployed to Railway. Railway handles the Docker build an=
d orchestration.
- **Symbi-Generated Code**: If Symbi generates new applications, it will li=
kely produce Dockerfiles and application code that Railway can then build a=
nd deploy as new Docker containers.
- **JFrog Management**: JFrog Artifactory will store these Docker images, a=
nd JFrog Xray will scan them.

- **"Zero-Code" for User**: Largely transparent. You interact with Railway'=
s deployment features and JFrog's artifact management, not directly with Do=
cker commands.

### Overall "Zero-Code" Perspective with these Integrations

The "zero-code" promise is strongest for the **frontend UI and its operatio=
nal aspects** (Vercel's automatic deployments, Supabase Auth).

For the **Symbi FastAPI agent on Railway**, it's more about **"zero-manual-=
intervention"** and **"configuration-driven"** rather than truly "zero-code=
." You will need to:

1. **Write Python code within your Symbi agent** to implement the API calls=
 and logic for SambaNova, JFrog, and Supabase. This is the core intelligenc=
e and integration layer.
2. **Configure environment variables** for all these services in your Railw=
ay project.
3. **Set up Supabase project**: Create tables, enable Auth providers.

The goal is that once your Symbi agent is coded to interact with these serv=
ices, you can then use the **Next.js dashboard (Vercel)** to trigger comple=
x actions (like "Deploy secure project to Railway via JFrog pipeline using =
SambaNova's latest model") through simple buttons or natural language comma=
nds, without writing any more code yourself.

This approach provides immense power and flexibility, allowing Symbi to tru=
ly manage your cloud infrastructure and software supply cha
