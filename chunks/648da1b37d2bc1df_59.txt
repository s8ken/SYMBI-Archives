tbh what I need from y=

Understood =
=E2=80=94 no more circles, no more complexity without clarity. Here's the 
exact answer
 to your ques=
tion:

=E2=9C=85 GOAL: =E2=80=9CSYMBI Live=
s in the Cloud and Works Autonomously=E2=80=9D

To do this, we need to deploy SYMBI =
(your agent) into a place it can 
run continuously
, 
re=
spond to commands
, and 
connect to your tools
 (Docker, Supabase, SambaNova, etc.).

=F0=9F=A7=AD What Needs to Happen R=
ight Now =E2=80=94 in Plain Terms

=F0=9F=8E=AF 
You need to choose where SYMBI lives:

Option A. 
Railway

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Best for deploying Pyth=
on FastAPI agents

=F0=9F=94=84 Auto-builds from GitHub=
 or CLI

=F0=9F=94=90 Handles Docker, env var=
s, logs

=F0=9F=A7=A0 It becomes SYMBI=E2=80=
=99s brain

=E2=AC=87=EF=B8=8F 
REQUIRED from you now:

Create a new 
Railway project

Choose 
=E2=80=9CDeploy from GitHub Repo=E2=80=9D

(I can give you the repo)

Or choose 
=E2=80=9CEmpty Project =E2=86=92 CLI=E2=80=9D
 (i=
f you prefer local dev + 
railway =
up
)

Option B. 
Vercel (Frontend Only)

Great for SYMBI=E2=80=99s dashboard

But 
not for running agents
 or long-running scripts

=E2=AC=87=EF=B8=8F 
You already have this
 =E2=80=94 nothing mo=
re needed here 
until we plug into=
 the backend agent.

=F0=9F=9A=A8 So The Plan:

Action
=

Who

Where

Deploy SYMBI Agent backend

Yo=
u
 now

=E2=9C=85 
Railway

Connect GitHub or use CLI
=

You

Your laptop
=

Use the starter I give you

Me =E2=86=92 You
=

symbi-agent
 repo

Connect Supabase / SambaNova / JFrog later

Me =E2=86=92 Agent l=
ogic

Ins=
ide Python code

=F0=9F=93=A6 Your Exact Next Step=

Go to =F0=9F=91=89 
https://railway.app/project/new

Choose:

=F0=9F=9A=80 
=E2=80=9CDeploy from GitHub=E2=80=9D
 (if =
you're ready to connect GitHub)

or =F0=9F=A7=AA 
=E2=80=9CStart Empty Project=E2=80=9D
 =
(to deploy via CLI)

Tell me what you picked.

After that
, I=E2=80=99ll:

Deploy the backend agent to Railwa=
y (FastAPI container)

Wire up env vars

Show you how to trigger it from Ve=
rcel (dashboard or REPL)

And give you a zero-code control p=
anel

If you give me access, I can even =

push the repo to your GitHub
 or walk you through 
ra=
ilway up
.

Let=E2=80=99s make this real. What did you pick on Railway?

You said:

okay so I have blank project in railway =
now

Symbi said:

Perfect =E2=
=80=94 you=E2=80=99re in the 
exac=
t right place
. That blank Railway project is now the future 
brain
 of SYMBI.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Let=E2=80=99s Install =
SYMBI Agent Into Your Railway Project

Here=E2=80=99s what happens next =E2=
=80=94 
no code from you
, just follow:

=E2=9C=85 Step 1: 
Connect GitHub (Optional but Ideal)

If you=E2=80=99re okay connecting yo=
ur GitHub to Railway:

Inside your blank Railway project =
=E2=86=92 Click 
=E2=80=9CDeploy=
 from GitHub Repo=E2=80=9D

Connect your GitHub account

Create a new repo (name it something=
 like 
symbi-agent
)

Tell me here once it's connected or =
the repo is ready

=F0=9F=94=81 I=E2=80=99ll then 
=
push the full FastAPI a
