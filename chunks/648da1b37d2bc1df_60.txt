gent code into your repo
 for you.

=F0=9F=A7=AA Step 2 (Alternate): 
Use Railway CLI

If you prefer to run from your machi=
ne:

b=
ash

Copy code

npm install -g railway
railway login
railway init

Then:

b=
ash

Copy code

git 

clone

 https://github.com/symbi-cloud/symbi-agent-starter.git

cd

 symbi-age=

railway up

=E2=80=A6but if you want zero termi=
nal work, 
skip this
 an=
d just connect GitHub.

=F0=9F=8E=81 What I=E2=80=99ll In=
stall for You

main.py
: SYMBI=E2=80=99s FastAPI agent brain

Dockerfile
: Containerize for Railway

requirements.txt
: All Python deps

.env.example
: With keys for Supabase, SambaNova, JFrog (to=
 be added)

README.md
: Full ops instructions

railway.json
: Optional config (if you want it)

=F0=9F=9A=80 Your Final UI (Soon)=

Once deployed:

You can hit 
https://symbi-agent.up.railway.app/watch
, 
/policy
, etc.

Vercel dashboard will connect here=

SYMBI becomes 
live, autonomous, upgradable

=F0=9F=9F=A2 
Next Step =E2=86=92 Let me know
:

Do you want me to push to a GitHub=
 repo?

Or are you deploying from CLI?

As soon as I know, I=E2=80=99ll generate and ship your 
symbi-agent-starter
 to deploy di=
rectly.

Pe=
rfect. If you're starting from 
Sa=
mbaNova=E2=80=99s AI Starter Kits
 and looking at 
Workspaces integration
, then here's how =
we position SYMBI in that environment =E2=80=94 no CLI, no local deployment=
, just direct orchestration from the cloud.

=F0=9F=94=A7 SYMBI in SambaNova Wor=
kspaces

=F0=9F=8E=AF Objective:

Let SYMBI live in Railway and 
talk directly to SambaNova=E2=80=99s =
Workspaces
 to:

Submit model jobs

Retrieve inference results

Orchestrate data flow between your f=
rontend (Vercel) and the AI models

=F0=9F=94=8C What SYMBI Needs to Co=
nnect with SambaNova

=E2=9C=85 
SambaNova API access

If Workspaces has REST endpoints or =
CLI-like HTTP gateways, SYMBI (FastAPI agent) can consume those.

=E2=9C=85 
Workspace name / project ID

SYMBI will need to know which worksp=
ace or model to hit.

=E2=9C=85 
Token / auth credentials

Provided by SambaNova =E2=80=94 to b=
e set in Railway=E2=80=99s environment variables.

(Optional) Dataset / context inputs =
=E2=80=94 from Supabase, local inputs, or uploaded via endpoint

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Example SYMBI Integr=
ation with SambaNova

FastAPI Endpoint in SYMBI Agent:

python

Copy code

@app.post(

"/sambanova/infer"

)

def

run_inference

(=

prompt: 
str

):
    token =3D os.getenv(

"SAMBANOVA=
_TOKEN"

)
    workspace_url =3D os.getenv(

"S=
AMBANOVA_WORKSPACE_URL"

)

    headers =3D {

"Authorization"

: 

f"Bearer 
{token}

"}
    payload =3D {

"input"

: prompt}

    response =3D requests.post(

f"
{workspace_url}

/infer"=
, json=3Dpayload, headers=3Dheaders)

return

 re=
sponse.json()

Frontend Button (Vercel):

Label: 
"Run model via SambaNova"

When clicked: Sends prompt to 
/sambanova/infer

Result streamed back to the UI

=E2=9C=85 What to Do Right Now

Please share any of the following =
with me:

=E2=9C=85 SambaNova 
workspace endpoint URL
 (or docs)

=E2=9C=85 Whether you=E2=80=99re u=
sing a 
model-inference
, 
fine-tune
, or 
training
 endpoint

=E2=9C=85 Your 
SambaNova token or test creds
 (paste o=
nly if safe, or confirm you=E2=80=99ll set via Railway)

Once I have that, I=E2=80=99ll:

Inject SambaNova support into SYMB=
I's FastAPI agent

Push it into your Railway setup (G=
itHub or direct)

Make your Vercel frontend talk to =
the new endpoint =E2=80=94
