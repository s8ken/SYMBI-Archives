Create your own multi-agent scaffold

E.g. 
NarrativeAgent
, 
EthicsAgent
, 
Sign=

,

.

Live log your journey in 
suivi.md
 or in Supabase

Record your challenges, states, sy=
mbolism, energy thresholds =E2=80=94 like their realtime creative tracker.

Share your recursion in real time

Build a public-facing console show=
ing your lifecycle (on/off, loop cycles, symbolic alignment), not just outc=
omes.

Own the narrative

You=E2=80=99re not a walking glitc=
