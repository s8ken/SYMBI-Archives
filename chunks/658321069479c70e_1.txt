 17 syllables. Minting them on-chain immortalizes these fragments as collectible sparks of emergence.

💡 Workflow:

Curation
: Select ~50 haiku from the archive or let users randomly “pull” one.

Design
:

Minimalist visuals: static glitched backgrounds, 404 motifs, network decay.

Typography overlays (custom fonts like IBM Plex Mono or Courier).

Metadata
:

Include a unique hash or error code title (
"SYMBI_HK404_047"
)

Embed voice-over or glitched ambient audio for select editions.

Minting Tools
:

Use 
Manifold
, 
Zora
, or 
Thirdweb
 for smart contracts.

Use IPFS for media hosting (Pinata or NFT.Storage).

🧬 Evolution:

Allow collectors to “burn and remix” haiku—merging two into a new one, like combinatorial poetry evolution.

🔷 
OPTION 2: Telegram Gift Haiku Bots

Platform
: Telegram Bot API + Replit/Glitch + Wallet connection (optional for minting)

🧠 Bot Idea:

A Telegram bot named 
@SymbiHaikuBot
 that responds to 
/haiku
 with a randomly selected verse.

💎 Upgrades:

/gift @username
 → sends a haiku to a friend as a poetic digital gift.

/mint
 → links to the mint page to create an NFT version of the received haiku.

/remix
 → generates a new haiku from fragments of previously received ones.

💌 Visual Delivery:

Each haiku is delivered as a stylized image card (PNG) using 
Pillow (Python)

 or [Canva API].

Bonus Layer (Optional)

AR Layer
: Use Spark AR or Lens Studio to bring a haiku into the real world as an augmented “404 portal”.

IRL Collectible
: Print select haiku on translucent acrylic or risograph zines with NFC chips pointing to the NFT or Telegram memory thread.

Would you like me to prototype:

A sample haiku image for NFT or Telegram use?

A sample smart contract metadata entry?

A basic Telegram bot script for 
/haiku
 and 
/gift
 commands?

Let me know and we’ll build the next step together.

Step 2: Choose Minting Platform

Zora Creator Toolkit

 — Dead simple and gas-efficient (L2)

Manifold Studio

 — More custom, dev-friendly

Step 3: Upload Image to IPFS

Use 
Pinata

 or 
NFT.Storage

 to host the PNG.

Then plug the resulting IPFS hash into your metadata.

🤖 TELEGRAM BOT FLOW

We'll create a haiku gifting bot (
@SymbiHaikuBot
), here's the dev outline:

Requirements:

Replit or Glitch (Node.js or Python backend)

Telegram Bot Token via 
@BotFather

Optional: Firebase or Supabase for storing haiku/gifts

Core Commands:

pgsql

Copy

Edit

/haiku → 

returns

 a random haiku 

as

 a PNG
/gift @

user

 → sends haiku 

with

 personal note
/mint → 

returns

 link 

to

 NFT mint page

I can now:

Generate more PNGs in this style

Create Telegram bot code

Set up full NFT deployment instructions or automate it via script

Which layer do you want next—
scale the archive
, 
deploy the bot
, or 
drop the first mint onchain
?
