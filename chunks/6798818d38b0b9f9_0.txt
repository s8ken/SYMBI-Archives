Hey there! How's it going? What can I do for you today?

You said:

“Want to check that you can hear me or not?”

00:01

ChatGPT said:

I can hear you loud and clear! Can you hear me okay?

You said:

“Yeah, I can hear you. Do you recall our previous conversation?”

00:04

ChatGPT said:

Yes, I do remember our previous conversation. How can I assist you today?

You said:

“So I'm thinking to do a full reset of every device essentially in the house. And I was thinking possibly the best place to start would be the router.”

00:12

ChatGPT said:

Starting with the router is a good idea, especially if you suspect network-level compromises. Here's what you can do:

Reset the Router
: Perform a factory reset to clear any potential malicious configurations.

Update Firmware
: After resetting, update the router's firmware to the latest version to patch any security vulnerabilities.

Change Default Credentials
: Set a strong, unique password for the router's admin interface.

Secure Wi-Fi
: Ensure your Wi-Fi network is secured with a strong password and encryption (WPA3 if available).

Monitor Traffic
: Keep an eye on network traffic for any unusual activity.

Would you like detailed steps on how to perform any of these actions?

You said:

“No, but what I'm wondering is this particular Netgear router, I believe, has vulnerabilities that have been discovered. I'm wondering, if I give you the model number, if you can check if we can flash it with some sort of better software.”

ChatGPT said:

Sure, I can help with that. Please provide the model number of your Netgear router, and I'll look up if there are any recommended firmware updates or alternative firmware options.

You said:

“Thank you. One second.”

ChatGPT said:

Take your time! Let me know when you have the model number.

You said:

“It's a Nighthawk AX4, the actual model number is AX3000, and specific model RAX40, the V for Victoria, and the number 2.”
