According to OpenWrt's wiki, the Netgear RAX40 isn't supported by OpenWrt. Similarly, many RAX routers, including the RAX40, aren't compatible with DD-WRT due to chipset limitations. Therefore, it's advisable to stick with the official Netgear firmware for your RAX40 V2. Let me know if you need help with anything else!

“Yes, in addition to the Netgear, I actually also have a TP-Link AC1200 mesh Wi-Fi router system. And what I'm wondering is, is one superior to the other? Or is there a perhaps a way we can utilize both devices to create an even stronger network?”

Both routers have their strengths. Here’s a quick comparison:

Netgear Nighthawk AX4 RAX40 V2
: This router supports Wi-Fi 6, offering faster speeds and better performance with compatible devices.

TP-Link AC1200 Mesh WiFi System
: This system is designed for broader coverage and can be expanded with additional mesh units. It’s ideal for covering larger areas with consistent signal strength.

Using Both Together
:

Router + Mesh
: You can use the Netgear as the main router and integrate the TP-Link mesh system to extend coverage in areas with weak signals.

Access Point Mode
: If the Netgear router allows, you can set it up as an access point connected to the TP-Link mesh for better performance in specific areas.

Would you like guidance on setting them up together?
