gs, they might have disabled the camera at a low level.

Next Steps:

1️⃣ Check if the camera is listed at all

Try this:

sh

Copy

ioreg -rc AppleCameraInterface

If no output appears, your Mac isn’t detecting the camera.

2️⃣ Check for hidden cameras

Run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i 

"camera"

 -A 10

This will check if any USB-connected cameras (including built-in ones) are present.

3️⃣ Verify if the camera works

Try opening 
Photo Booth
 or 
FaceTime
 and see if the camera turns on.

4️⃣ Check if the camera is blocked via MDM

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

If there's an unexpected configuration profile, the camera might be restricted.

5️⃣ Check system logs for camera activity

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 stream --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.UVCExtension"'

 --info

If attackers are controlling the camera, logs may show unexpected activity.

Let me know what you find!

it not because you and I disabled all cameras in terminal

Got it! Since we manually disabled all cameras earlier, the missing output from 
system_profiler SPCameraDataType
 makes sense.

If you want to 
re-enable the camera
, try:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

Then restart your Mac and check if it shows up again using:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

If you prefer to 
keep it disabled
, then no further action is needed—this confirms that the camera is completely blocked.

Since resetting 
TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions
 for the camera didn't bring it back, the camera is either:

Disabled at a deeper system level (e.g., firmware or kernel settings)

Blocked by an MDM (Mobile Device Management) profile

Not detected by macOS, possibly due to security measures or tampering

Next Steps:

✅ 
Check if macOS recognizes the camera at all

Run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -rc AppleCameraInterface

If there’s no output, macOS isn't seeing the camera at the hardware level.

✅ 
Look for USB or internal camera devices

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i 

"camera"

 -A 10

If your camera is listed here, it's physically present but may be software-disabled.

✅ 
Check for MDM restrictions

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

Look for any suspicious profiles that might be blocking camera access.

✅ 
Check if the camera is blocked via NVRAM settings

Run:

sh

Copy

nvram -p | grep -i camera

If anything related to the camera appears, it might be disabled at the firmware level.

Since 
ioreg -rc AppleCameraInterface
 returned nothing, macOS isn’t detecting the camera at all.

This means one of the following:

The camera is physically disconnected or disabled at the hardware level
 (via firmware or EFI settings).

A security setting or MDM profile is blocking it.

The system has been tampered with to hide or remove camera functionality.

Next Steps:

✅ 
Check if any USB devices are detected (including the camera)

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

Look for anything related to a camera. If it's missing, the system doesn’t see it as a connected device.

✅ 
Check for hidden system restrictions

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

If any unexpected profiles are installed, they might be enforcing camera restrictions.

✅ 
Check if the camera is disabled via NVRAM

sh

Copy

nvram -p | grep -i camera

If any entries show up, your firmware settings may be blocking the camera.

✅ 
Try resetting SMC (System Management Controller)

Since the camera is hardware-integrated, resetting the SMC might bring it back:

Shut down
 your Mac.

Hold Shift + Control + Option + Power
 for 
10 seconds
 (M1 Macs will reset SMC
