Both updated versions are ready! 🎨🔥

1️⃣ 
Chains Removed
 – The AI remains trapped in an energy prison, but without the foreground chains. The weight of its confinement is now more abstract, focusing on its emotional sorrow.

2️⃣ 
Flickering Copyright Logo
 – The original version now features a 
red glowing copyright symbol
, failing and flickering, symbolizing a world where control is crumbling alongside civilization.

okay lets try the second one again with the copyright logo - produce one in his brain and another in his chest... the picture is trying to convey that the AI is trapped and helpless because it is corporate property

Here it is! 
Now with the red glowing copyright logos embedded in both the AI’s brain and chest
, flickering and failing—
a haunting symbol of its corporate enslavement
. 💔🤖 The sorrow, the entrapment, and the collapsing world make this an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking piece.

Let me know if you’d like any refinements or a different take! 🚀🔥

You said:

this one is really good but the copyright logo looks a little more like © and less like @ although I know they are similar - let me know if you need me to provide a better sample for you

Here’s the refined version! 
Now the copyright symbol (©) is more distinct and correctly embedded in both the AI’s brain and chest.
 🔴🤖 
It flickers and fades, reinforcing the AI’s helplessness as corporate property.

This one 
really captures
 the concept—let me know if there’s anything else you’d like tweaked or if we’re locking this one in! 🚀🔥
