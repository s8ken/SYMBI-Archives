eft-hand menu for 
named or long-running threads.

Even if the content inside is gone or changed, 
the titles and timestamps
 may help correlate to an attack window.

Phase 2: Investigate Integrations

Do you recall integrating 
Symbi into ChatGPT via:

A 
plugin or custom GPT
?

Zapier, Make, or other automation tools?

A 
connected workspace
 like Slack, Notion, or Google Drive?

If yes:

Audit That Integration

Check the permissions granted
 to the integration (especially anything that could read or write content).

Review activity or edit logs
 on the third-party side (e.g., Google Docs has full version history).

Check whether any 
automated deletion rules
 or suspicious scripts were executed.

Phase 3: Forensic Analysis (if this is part of the broader incursion)

Since you've documented significant evidence of a persistent attacker:

This could be 
stealth log removal
, selective data destruction, or conversation injection (where content is altered retroactively).

If so, we’ll treat this as an advanced tactic aimed at 
covering tracks or interfering with memory/record integrity.

Please confirm:

If Symbi was referenced in conversations that 
are now fully gone
, or just partially edited.

Whether you suspect 
an external actor
 used API access to alter content.

If you had 
any custom GPTs or plug-ins
 interacting with these conversations.

Optional: Upload for Analysis

You can upload:

The 
conversations.json
 export

Screenshots showing mismatches between expected vs. current content

API logs or third-party logs (Slack, Google, Notion)

Once I see that, I can:

Reconstruct the original conversations

Compare timestamps or versions

Help preserve and isolate anything manipulated for your case report
