In the vast expanse of YouTube, some channels employ names that mimic official services, a tactic that can mislead the unwary.

Such channels might direct users to external sites under false pretenses, leading them into traps laid by digital tricksters.

These external sites could harbor malicious software or phish for personal information.

To navigate these murky waters safely, consider the following:

Scrutinize Content
: 
Be wary of channels that promise extravagant rewards or direct you to unfamiliar websites.

Verify Authenticity

so its on the official YouTube site

Yes, the channel 
@select_site
 is hosted on 
YouTube’s official platform
, meaning the link itself is not dangerous. However, just because a channel exists on YouTube doesn't automatically mean it's trustworthy.

There are still 
some red flags
 to consider:

It mimics "YouTube Select"
, which is an official ad program by YouTube, but this channel is 
not verified
 as an official YouTube entity.

Scam channels often exist on YouTube
 – some pretend to be official sources while promoting sketchy links or misleading information.

What is the channel’s purpose?
 If it tries to 
redirect users off YouTube to another website
, especially with promises of rewards, software downloads, or exclusive access, that’s a 
major warning sign
.

What You Should Do:

Check if the channel has an 
official verification checkmark
 (gray or blue tick).

Look at its 
content and comments
 – are they legitimate, or do they seem fake, bot-driven, or spammy?

Avoid clicking any links in the 
video descriptions or pinned comments
 unless you're certain they lead to a trusted source.

If they claim to be part of YouTube's official program, cross-check their legitimacy by visiting the 
official YouTube Select page

.

⚠️ 
Bottom line:
 The channel may be hosted on YouTube, but that doesn’t guarantee it’s safe. Stay cautious, especially if it asks you to visit external sites!

its interesting because on a mobile device m.YouTube.com/select_site is the settings page

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

Ah, now 
that
 is intriguing. 😈 If 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 leads to the 
YouTube settings page on mobile
, but there's also a 
YouTube channel with the handle @select_site
, then we've got a potential 
SEO or branding exploit
 at play.

Possible Explanations:

Brand Imitation Tactic

Some people 
intentionally
 create usernames or handles that mimic 
official YouTube subdirectories
 (like 
/select_site
).

This could confuse users into thinking the channel is part of 
YouTube's official settings or services
.

YouTube’s URL Handling Quirk

On desktop, YouTube handles usernames differently (
youtube.com/@select_site
).

On mobile, 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 might be 
redirecting internally
 to YouTube’s settings.

If this channel was created 
before YouTube reserved the "select_site" path for settings
, then YouTube might be stuck allowing both.

Potential for Phishing or Misinformation

If an unsuspecting user 
hears about "select_site" from a sketchy source
 and searches it, they might land on this channel instead of 
YouTube’s official settings page
.

A bad actor could 
exploit that confusion
 to drive traffic to
