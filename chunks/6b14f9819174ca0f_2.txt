Should You Be Worried?

If YouTube allowed a user to take 
@select_site
 as a channel name, it's not 
outright malicious
, but it 
can be misleading
.

It might 
cause confusion
, especially for mobile users who expect 
settings but land on a channel instead
.

What You Can Do:

✅ 
Test the URLs Yourself:

Go to 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 on mobile and see what happens.

Then go to 
youtube.com/@select_site
 and compare.

✅ 
Report It to YouTube (If Needed):

If the channel is misleading people, YouTube 
might
 step in and restrict it.

Report suspicious activity through 
YouTube’s Help Page

.

✅ 
Stay Skeptical of Any Links Shared by the Channel.

🚨 
Final Thought:

This feels like a 
clever but potentially shady branding play
—someone managed to 
hijack a name that looks "official"
 while not actually being affiliated with YouTube. Smart, but a little sus. 😏

I already did - so its impacting the mobile version mainly but this impacts apps like Facebook for example where you may not be signed into YouTube... I was reviewing my watch history through the Facebook app and whenever I went to the settings page it is saved in my history with the mr studio logo indicating I was logged in as them

Whoa, 
that’s a major security and branding loophole
—and it sounds like it could have serious 
privacy implications
 if it’s affecting apps like Facebook where users might not be fully signed into YouTube. 😳

Key Issues Here:

Settings Page Confusion on Mobile

If 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 is supposed to lead to YouTube's settings but instead logs history under the 
@select_site
 channel, that’s a problem.

Some users may unknowingly interact with a third-party channel instead of their 
actual account settings.

Facebook’s In-App Browser May Be Affected

When you access YouTube via 
Facebook's in-app browser
 (instead of a normal browser like Chrome), it might not handle redirects the same way.

It 
may be associating
 a YouTube session with the 
wrong entity (e.g., Mr Studio/Select Site).

This could 
potentially expose your activity
 to the owner of that channel in weird ways.

MR STUDIO Logo Appearing in History??

If your 
watch history logs visits to your own settings
 as if you were using 
another account (like Mr Studio's)
, that suggests a potential 
cross-session data mix-up
 on YouTube’s end.

Worst-case scenario:
 If this flaw lets someone else view other users' settings or watch history, that’s a 
huge
 data leak.

What Could Be Happening?

Bug in YouTube’s Mobile Pathing System
:

YouTube might have 
reserved 
/select_site
 for settings
 but forgot to fully prevent users from 
claiming the same path as a username.

This results in a conflict, especially on mobile, where different routing logic is used.

Misconfigured Authentication via Embedded Browsers (like Facebook's in-app browser):

Facebook’s in-app browser sometimes caches old session data, which 
can lead to incorrect session attribution.

If YouTube’s authentication is 
mismatched
, it might cause activity to be logged under the wrong entity.

What You Can Do (and What You Already Did Right 💪):

✅ 
Report It to YouTube ASAP

This isn’t just a 
random channel confusion issue
—this could be a 
privacy vulnerability
 if people’s sessions are being linked to the wrong accounts.

Use 
YouTube’s Bug Report Tool

 to flag it.

✅ 
Test in Other Browsers & Devices

Open 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox to see if it behaves the same way.

If it only happens in Facebook’s browser, then 
Facebook is handling YouTube sessions incorrectly.

✅ 
Clear Cookies & Cache in Facebook’s Browser

Facebook’s in-app browser is notorious for 
session conflicts
.

Go to 
Facebook → Settings → Browser Settings → Clear Browsing Data
 to reset cached sessions.

✅ 
Monitor Your Google Account for Any Suspicious Activity

Since YouTube history is tied to 
your Google account
, double-check t
