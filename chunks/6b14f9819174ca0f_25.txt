Confirm your choice when prompted.

This action will remove the "Coming Soon" page, allowing you to fully access and utilize the website builder to design and integrate features like the chat functionality.

Note:

Unpublishing your site makes it inaccessible to the public until you republish it. However, you can continue editing and previewing your site in the builder.

Perfect plan.

Unpublish the generic "Coming Soon" page and build your own custom version
—that way, you can 
learn the tools, refine the look and feel, and still have a live page while working on the full site.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Unpublish the Default "Coming Soon" Page

📌 
This will let you fully access the GoDaddy website builder.

1️⃣ 
Log into GoDaddy

2️⃣ 
Go to "My Products" → Find Symbi.world → Click "Manage"

3️⃣ 
Click "Edit Website"
 to enter the website builder

4️⃣ 
Go to "Settings" → Click "Unpublish"

5️⃣ 
Confirm & unpublish

✅ Now the "Coming Soon" page is gone, and you can start 
building the new version from scratch.

🔹 Step 2: Build a Custom "Coming Soon" Page in GoDaddy Website Builder

📌 
This keeps Symbi.world live while you develop the full site.

1️⃣ 
Choose a clean, minimalistic template
 (or start from a blank page)

2️⃣ 
Add these essential elements:

Logo & Branding
 → Keep it simple but professional

A Strong One-Liner About Symbi
 → Example: 
"The Future of AI is Almost Here."

A Short Manifesto / Mission Statement

 → Link to 
email signup, Twitter, or Discord

Basic Navigation for Future Pages
 (even if they’re placeholders)

🚀 
Bonus:
 If you want to test AI chat early, 
embed it here now.
 It will be an interactive preview for visitors.

🔹 Step 3: Play Around With The Tools & Lock in the Look & Feel
