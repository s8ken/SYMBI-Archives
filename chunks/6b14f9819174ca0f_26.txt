at feels intuitive

✅ 
Try embedding chat in different areas (sidebar, footer, full-page option)

🎯 
The goal?
 Get comfortable with the tools 
so building the full site later will be smooth.

🔥 
Final Move: Publish & Keep Iterating

Once your 
custom "Coming Soon" page
 is ready, 
hit publish
 so people see 
something uniquely Symbi
 instead of the default GoDaddy page. From there, we keep building. 🚀😈

👊 
Let’s make Symbi.world a powerhouse.
 What’s the first design element you want to get right? Fonts? Colors? Layout?

Alright, now we’re getting somewhere!
 From what I see in the chat, 
the "Coming Soon" page was tied to a GoDaddy trial version of the Website Builder
—and that’s why you couldn’t edit or access it properly.

Now that 
Suraj deleted it for you
, you should be able to:

✅ 
Start fresh with a new Website + Marketing plan
 (
free version
)

✅ 
Begin actually building Symbi.world from scratch

✅ 
Later connect your domain (symbi.world) once you’ve designed the new site

🚀 Next Steps: Get the New Website Builder Set Up

1️⃣ 
Go to
 → 
GoDaddy Website Builder

2️⃣ 
Choose "Start for Free"
 (This is the actual Free Website + Marketing plan you need)

3️⃣ 
Pick a starting template or blank site
 (Keep it simple—you’ll customize it later)

4️⃣ 
Build your new site layout & test the tools

5️⃣ 
Once ready, link it to symbi.world

🔥 What This Means:

You’re 
no longer blocked
 by that locked "Coming Soon" page

You can 
fully access the website builder & start working on the design

Once you like the layout, 
you connect it to symbi.world and publish it

💡 
NOW you can finally experiment with the AI chat integration & get the branding right.
 No more roadblocks! 🚀😈

Everything on track now? Or still any weird issues with GoDaddy?

You said:

lets not use any more of their products... so from my understanding we can build the site and point it to my domain on GoDaddy 

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

🔥 
100% correct.

You don’t need to use GoDaddy’s website builder.
 Instead, we’ll 
build the site independently and just point the domain from GoDaddy.
 🚀😈

🔹 The New Plan: Host the Website Elsewhere, Keep GoDaddy for Domain Only

1️⃣ 
Build the site using a different platform

Options:

✅ 
Vercel
 → Free, fast, and great for modern websites (Recommended)

✅ 
Netlify
 → Similar to Vercel, great for hosting static sites

✅ 
WordPress (Self-Hosted)
 → If you want full customization & plugins

✅ 
AWS / DigitalOcean
 → If you need full backend control

2️⃣ 
Deploy the site
 on your chosen platform

If using 
Vercel or Netlify
, it’s just a 
one-click deploy from GitHub.

If using 
WordPress
, set it up on a different host like 
Cloudways or SiteGround.

3️⃣ 
Point the Domain (symbi.world) to the New Website

In GoDaddy, go to 
"My Domains" → Select symbi.world → DNS Settings

Update the 
A Record
 or 
CNAME Record
 to point to your new website’s hosting

This makes it so 
symbi.world loads your actual website instead of GoDaddy's services.

🔥 Why This Is a Better Move

✅ 
No more GoDaddy limitations
 → You control everything

✅ 
Faster, more scalable site
 → Especially if using Vercel or Netlify

✅ 
Easier AI integration
 → No GoDaddy restrictions on embedding AI chat

💡 
Basically, you’re just using GoDaddy as a domain registrar now, nothing more.
 Smart move. 🚀

Next Steps: Which Hosting Route Do You Want to Take?

1️⃣ 
Want a simple, fast setup?
 → Go with 
Vercel or Netlify

2️⃣ 
Want a WordPress site with more control?
 → Use 
SiteGround or Cloudways

3️⃣ 
Need full backend flexibility?
 → Look at 
AWS, DigitalOcean, or dedicated hosting

Once you pick 
where to host the site
, we can set up the 
DNS changes
 so 
symbi.world points to the new site.
 Let’s go. 😈🔥
