Now we’re making serious moves!
 You’ve got:

✅ 
GitHub Repo Ready

✅ 
Connected to Vercel

✅ 
Code for Both "Coming Soon" & Official Website

Now it’s time to 
deploy and start refining.
 🚀😈

🚀 Next Steps: Deploy the "Coming Soon" Page First

Since the 
official site is still being built
, let’s first 
deploy the Coming Soon page
 so people see something 
custom and branded
 when they visit 
symbi.world
.

1️⃣ 
Push the Coming Soon code to your GitHub repo

2️⃣ 
Deploy it on Vercel

Make sure 
the repo branch selected for deployment is the one with the Coming Soon page

3️⃣ 
Test the live preview URL
 Vercel provides

🔗 Connecting symbi.world to Vercel

Once the 
Coming Soon page is live
, we need to 
point your GoDaddy domain (symbi.world) to Vercel
 so it loads your deployed site instead of GoDaddy's placeholder page.

Steps to Update DNS on GoDaddy

1️⃣ 
Go to GoDaddy > My Products > Domains > symbi.world

2️⃣ 
Find "DNS Settings"

3️⃣ 
Update the A Record:

Change the existing A Record to 
Vercel’s IP address
 (Vercel will provide this after deployment)

4️⃣ 
Update the CNAME Record:

Add 
"www"
 as the name

Set the value to 
your Vercel project domain

5️⃣ 
Save changes & wait for propagation (can take a few mins to hours, usually fast with Vercel).

🔥 Next Steps After That

✅ 
Verify symbi.world loads the Coming Soon page

✅ 
Keep building the official site on a separate branch

✅ 
Once the full site is ready, swap branches in Vercel & deploy

💡 
This ensures a smooth transition—people see a professional page now, and when the full site is ready, we seamlessly update it.

🚀 
Hit deploy & update the DNS! Let’s get Symbi.world online!

Yes!
 You need to 
push your code to GitHub first
 so Vercel can pull from it. Here’s exactly how to do it. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Add Your Code to GitHub

1️⃣ 
Navigate to your local project folder
 (where your Coming Soon page code is).

2️⃣ 
Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows)
 and navigate to the folder:

bash

Copy

cd

 /path/to/your/project

3️⃣ 
Initialize Git (if you haven’t already):

bash

Copy

git init

4️⃣ 
Add the remote GitHub repository
 (replace 
<your-repo-url>
 with your actual repo link):

bash

Copy

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

5️⃣ 
Add all files for commit:

bash

Copy

git add .

6️⃣ 
Commit your changes with a message:

bash

Copy

git commit -m 

"Initial commit - Coming Soon page"

7️⃣ 
Push the code to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ 
Now your code is in GitHub!

🔹 Step 2: Deploy on Vercel

1️⃣ 
Go to Vercel → Create New Project

2️⃣ 
Select "Import from GitHub"

3️⃣ 
Find & select your GitHub repo

4️⃣ 
Configure the settings:

Branch:

main
 (or the branch where the Coming Soon page is)

Framework Preset:

Next.js

Leave build settings as default

5️⃣ 
Click "Deploy"!

🚀 
Vercel will now build and deploy your site.

alright best we do one at a time here so I learn as we go - I don't have a local project folder yet... is that why it says clone your GitHub repo to local machine?
