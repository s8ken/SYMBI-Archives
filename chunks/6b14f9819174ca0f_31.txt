Yes, exactly!
 Since your GitHub repo is currently empty, 
you need to clone it to your local machine
 so you can add your code and push it back up. This will create a local folder where you can work on the project. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Clone Your GitHub Repo to Your Local Machine

1️⃣ 
Copy your GitHub repo URL:

Go to your repo on GitHub

Click the 
“Code”
 button (green)

Copy the 
HTTPS URL

2️⃣ 
Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows) and navigate to where you want the project folder:

bash

Copy

cd

 /path/to/your/preferred/location

(Example: 
cd ~/Documents/Projects
)

3️⃣ 
Run this command to clone the repo:

bash

Copy

git 

clone

 <your-repo-url>

Example:

bash

Copy

git 

clone

 https://github.com/yourusername/symbi-website.git

✅ 
Now you have a local project folder with your GitHub repo inside it!

🔹 Step 2: Navigate Into the Project Folder

Once cloning is complete, move into the project folder:

bash

Copy

cd

 symbi-website

(
Replace 
symbi-website
 with your actual repo name.
)

🔹 Step 3: Add Your "Coming Soon" Code Into This Folder

Now that the folder is on your machine, you can:

✅ 
Copy your "Coming Soon" page code into this directory.

✅ 
Make any edits or customizations if needed.

✅ 
Then push it back to GitHub.

🚀 Next Move:

Once you've added your code, let me know, and we’ll 
commit & push it back to GitHub.

okay so I think I want to put it straight into 'Proton Drive' and in there I just created a folder called 'Symbi Website"

Smart move—keeping everything organized in Proton Drive!
 Now, let’s make sure your 
Git repo is linked to that folder
 so any updates in Proton Drive can be pushed to GitHub. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Link Your Proton Drive Folder to GitHub

Since Proton Drive is 
a cloud storage solution
, it doesn’t natively support Git.

But 
you can still use Git in a folder inside Proton Drive
 as long as it syncs properly.

1️⃣ 
Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows).

2️⃣ 
Navigate to your Proton Drive folder where you created "Symbi Website":

bash

Copy

cd

"/path/to/Proton Drive/Symbi Website"

🔹 
If your path has spaces, make sure to use quotes!

3️⃣ 
Initialize Git inside this folder:

bash

Copy

git init

4️⃣ 
Link it to your GitHub repo:

bash

Copy

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

(Replace 
<your-repo-url>
 with the actual URL of your GitHub repo.)

🔹 Step 2: Add Your "Coming Soon" Code to the Folder

Now, 
place your "Coming Soon" page files
 inside 
"Symbi Website"
 in Proton Drive.

✅ If it's a Next.js project, the folder should contain:

bash

Copy

/pages
/public
/styles
package.json
next.config.js

✅ If it's a simple HTML page, just place:

diff

Copy

index.html

styles.css

🔹 Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

Once the files are inside your Proton Drive folder, 
push them to GitHub
:

1️⃣ 
Go back to Terminal/Git Bash (while inside "Symbi Website" folder)

2️⃣ 
Stage all files:

bash

Copy

git add .

3️⃣ 
Commit with a message:

bash

Copy

git commit -m 

"Added Coming Soon page"

4️⃣ 
Push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ 
Now your "Coming Soon" page is in GitHub!
 🚀

🚀 Next Move: Deploy on Vercel

Once your code is in GitHub, let me know, and we’ll 
set up Vercel to pull it and deploy it live!

No worries—this just means we need to use the correct file path for Proton Drive.
 Let’s find it and navigate properly. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Find the Correct Path to Proton Drive

Since Proton Drive syncs to your local machine, we need to locate the 
exact path where your "Symbi Website" folder is stored.

Option 1: Use Finder to Find the Path (Easiest)

1️⃣ 
Open Finder
 on your Mac.

2️⃣ 
Go to your Proton Drive folder
 and find 
"Symbi Website".

3️⃣ 
Right-click the folder
