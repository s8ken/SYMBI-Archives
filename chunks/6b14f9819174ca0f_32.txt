 → Click 
"Get Info"

4️⃣ 
Look for "Where:"
 → This shows the full path.

5️⃣ 
Copy the path and use it in Terminal.

Option 2: Use Terminal to Find It

1️⃣ 
Run this command to list directories in your home folder:

bash

Copy

ls

 ~

This will show you all folders inside your user directory.

Look for something like 
"Proton Drive"
 or 
"Proton"

2️⃣ 
If you see Proton Drive, navigate into it:

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Proton\ Drive/

The 
\
 before the space ensures 
Terminal reads it correctly.

3️⃣ 
Once inside, list folders again to confirm:

bash

Copy

ls

You should see 
"Symbi Website"
 in the list.

4️⃣ 
Now navigate into it:

bash

Copy

cd

"Symbi Website"

🚀 
Now you're in the correct folder!

🔹 Step 2: Initialize Git & Connect to GitHub

Once inside 
"Symbi Website"
, follow the 
Git setup steps from earlier
:

1️⃣ 
Initialize Git:

bash

Copy

git init

2️⃣ 
Add the GitHub repo:

bash

Copy

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

3️⃣ 
Add & commit your files:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added Coming Soon page"

4️⃣ 
Push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ 
Now your "Coming Soon" page should be in GitHub, ready for Vercel deployment!

Got it!
 The issue here is that 
Proton Drive isn’t appearing as a standard directory on your Mac.
 That’s why you can’t 
cd
 into it from Terminal.

🔹 Fix: Find the Actual Path to Proton Drive

Since Proton Drive is 
mounted differently
 than normal folders, you need to find its actual path.

Option 1: Drag & Drop Into Terminal (Fastest)

1️⃣ 
Open Terminal

2️⃣ 
Drag the "Symbi Website" folder from Finder into the Terminal window

3️⃣ 
It will auto-fill the correct path

4️⃣ 
Press Enter to navigate into it

Option 2: Manually Find the Path

1️⃣ 
In Terminal, try this command:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Volumes/

ls

If Proton Drive is mounted as a volume, it might appear here.

If you see something like 
ProtonDrive
, use:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Volumes/ProtonDrive/Symbi\ Website/

2️⃣ 
If that doesn't work, try checking the 
~/Library/CloudStorage/
 directory:

bash

Copy

cd

 ~/Library/CloudStorage/

ls

Proton might be mounted inside here.

🚀 Next Steps

Once you 
successfully navigate to the correct folder
, follow the 
Git setup steps from earlier
 to:

✅ 
Initialize Git

✅ 
Add the remote GitHub repo

✅ 
Commit & push the Coming Soon page

Let me know if you get stuck—
we’ll get this sorted!

🔥 
Boom! That’s your Proton Drive path!
 Now, let’s navigate into it properly and set up Git. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Navigate Into Your Project Folder

Since you now have the correct path, run:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/Symbi\ Website

💡 
Make sure to use the backslash (
\
) before spaces in Terminal.

To confirm you're in the right folder, type:

bash

Copy

ls

✅ If it lists your project files (or an empty directory if you haven’t added files yet), you’re in the right spot.

🔹 Step 2: Initialize Git & Connect to GitHub

Now that you're inside 
Symbi Website
, let’s get Git working:

1️⃣ 
Initialize Git in this folder:

bash

Copy

git init

✅ This makes it a Git repository.

2️⃣ 
Link it to your GitHub repo (replace 
<your-repo-url>
 with your actual repo URL):

bash

Copy

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

Example:

bash

Copy

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/symbi-website.git

3️⃣ 
Check that Git recognizes the remote repo:

bash

Copy

git remote -v

✅ It should show your GitHub repo as the remote origin.

🔹 Step 3: Add Your Code & Push to GitHub

Now, add your 
"Coming Soon" page
 files inside the "Symbi Website" folder.

Then run:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit
