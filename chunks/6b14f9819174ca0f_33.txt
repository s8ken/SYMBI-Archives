Perfect! You’ve successfully initialized Git and connected your GitHub repo.
 Now, let’s get your 
"Coming Soon" page files added and pushed.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Add Your "Coming Soon" Page Files

Right now, your folder 
looks empty (
ls
 returned nothing).

Make sure you’ve 
placed your Coming Soon page files inside "Symbi Website".

✅ If it's a simple HTML page, your folder should have:

diff

Copy

index.html

styles.css

✅ If it's a Next.js project, your folder should have:

bash

Copy

/pages
/public
/styles
package.json
next.config.js

🔹 Step 2: Add, Commit & Push to GitHub

Once the files are inside the folder, run these commands:

1️⃣ 
Add all files to Git tracking:

bash

Copy

git add .

2️⃣ 
Commit the changes with a message:

bash

Copy

git commit -m 

"Added Coming Soon page"

3️⃣ 
Push the code to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ 
Now, your "Coming Soon" page will be in GitHub!

🚀 Next Step: Deploy on Vercel

Once you confirm the files are in GitHub, we’ll connect Vercel and 
get this thing live.
 Let me know when you’re ready! 😈🔥

sorry where do I get the files from

No worries! You need the actual "Coming Soon" page files first before pushing to GitHub.
 Let’s get that sorted. 🚀😈

🔹 Option 1: Use a Simple HTML "Coming Soon" Page (Fastest)

If you 
just need a placeholder page
, you can create a simple 
index.html
 file right now.

1️⃣ Create the file inside your project folder:

Run this in Terminal:

bash

Copy

echo

"<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Symbi - Coming Soon</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; padding: 50px; }
        h1 { font-size: 50px; }
        p { font-size: 20px; color: #666; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Symbi is Coming Soon</h1>
    <p>The future of AI is almost here. Stay tuned.</p>
</body>
</html>"
 > index.html

🔹 This creates a 
basic Coming Soon page
 inside your "Symbi Website" folder.

🔹 Option 2: Use the Next.js Version from v0.dev

If you want to 
deploy the version you made on v0.dev
, you need to:

1️⃣ 
Go to 
v0.dev

 and find your Symbi AI website project

2️⃣ 
Download the Next.js code it generated

3️⃣ 
Extract the files and move them into your "Symbi Website" folder

🔹 After moving the files, check that the folder has:

bash

Copy

/pages
/public
/styles
package.json
next.config.js

✅ Now, your Next.js project is ready to be pushed to GitHub.

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Decide which version to use (HTML or Next.js from v0.dev).

2️⃣ 
Place the files inside the "Symbi Website" folder.

3️⃣ 
Run these in Terminal to push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added Coming Soon page"

git push -u origin main

4️⃣ 
Once it’s in GitHub, we deploy it on Vercel!

Let me know 
which version you want to go with, and I’ll help with the next step.
