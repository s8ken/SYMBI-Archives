ep 1: Navigate to the Project Folder in Terminal

Since your folder is called 
"symbi-ai-website"
, run this in Terminal:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

(Adjust if needed based on your actual Proton Drive path.)

To confirm you’re in the right folder, run:

bash

Copy

ls

✅ If it lists files like 

package.json

, 

next.config.mjs

, and folders like 

app/

, then you’re good to go.

🔹 Step 2: Initialize Git & Connect to GitHub (If Not Done Already)

If you haven’t initialized Git inside this folder yet, do this:

bash

Copy

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
git remote -v  

# (Check that it's correctly linked)

✅ If you already did this before, skip to Step 3.

🔹 Step 3: Add, Commit, and Push the Code to GitHub

Now, let’s get your files pushed to GitHub:

1️⃣ 
Stage all files for commit:

bash

Copy

git add .

2️⃣ 
Commit the changes with a message:

bash

Copy

git commit -m 

"Added Symbi Coming Soon page"

3️⃣ 
Push the code to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ 
Your full project should now be in GitHub!
 🎉

🚀 Step 4: Deploy on Vercel

1️⃣ 
Go to 
Vercel

2️⃣ 
Create a New Project
 → Select 
"Import from GitHub"

3️⃣ 
Find & select your 
Symbi
 repo

4️⃣ 
Framework Preset
 → Select 
"Next.js"

5️⃣ 
Click "Deploy"!

Vercel will build and deploy your site, giving you a 
live preview link
 once it’s done.

🔥 Next Move: Connect symbi.world to Vercel

Once your site is live, we’ll update your 
GoDaddy DNS settings
 so 
symbi.world
 points to the Vercel-hosted version.

🚀 
Let me know once the GitHub push is done, and we’ll move to Vercel!

You're almost there!
 Just a small fix—your terminal is showing 
quote>
 which means it's 
stuck inside some input mode
 (possibly from copying commands in bulk).

🔹 How to Fix It

1️⃣ 
Press 
Ctrl + C

 to exit the 
quote>
 mode.

2️⃣ 
Then manually re-run these commands one by one:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added Symbi Coming Soon page"

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ 
This will properly stage, commit, and push your code to GitHub.

Once it’s pushed, 
check GitHub
 to confirm the files are there. Then we move to 
Vercel deployment!

Got it!
 The error 
"fatal: not a git repository"
 means Git 
wasn't properly initialized
 in your folder, or it got removed somehow.

🔹 Step 1: Reinitialize Git in the Correct Folder

Since you’re already inside 
symbi-ai-website
, run:

bash

Copy

git init

✅ This reinitializes Git in your project folder.

🔹 Step 2: Reconnect to GitHub

Since the 
.git
 folder was missing, you need to 
re-add your remote GitHub repo
:

bash

Copy

git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git

Then verify it’s linked correctly:

bash

Copy

git remote -v

✅ It should show 
"origin"
 pointing to your GitHub repo.

🔹 Step 3: Add, Commit & Push to GitHub

Now, try pushing your code again:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added Symbi Coming Soon page"

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

🚀 
This should now work without errors!

Once it’s in GitHub, we move to 
Vercel deployment.
 😈🔥 Let me know if you hit any snags!
