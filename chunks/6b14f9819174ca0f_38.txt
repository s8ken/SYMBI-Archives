✅ Fix:

Delete
 the lines with 
<<<<<<< HEAD
, 
=======
, and 
>>>>>>> origin/main
.

Merge the content properly.

Your final 
.gitignore
 file should 
NOT
 have conflict markers and should look like this:

plaintext

Copy

# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
lerna-debug.log*
.pnpm-debug.log*

# Diagnostic reports (https://nodejs.org/api/report.html)
report.[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*.json

# Runtime data
pids
*.pid
*.seed
*.pid.lock

# Ignore node_modules and build files
node_modules/
.next/
out/
dist/
.cache/
.DS_Store
.vercel/
.vscode/
.env

✅ 
Make sure all necessary 
.gitignore
 rules are included!

🔹 Step 2: Save & Exit

In 
Nano Editor
, press 
CTRL + X

Press 
Y
 to 
confirm saving

Press 
Enter
 to save & exit

🔹 Step 3: Mark Conflict as Resolved

Now, tell Git that you’ve fixed the file:

bash

Copy

git add .gitignore

Then continue the rebase:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

✅ 
If Git has more conflicts, repeat this process for any other files.

✅ 
If no more conflicts, Git will complete the rebase.

🔹 Step 4: Push the Fixed Code to GitHub

Once rebase is complete, 
push your updated branch to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

🚀 
This will finalize everything and update GitHub.

🔥 Next Step: Deploy on Vercel

Once your code is in GitHub, we 
connect it to Vercel and make Symbi.world live!

Let me know when you’ve pushed successfully. 😈🔥

Alright, let’s get you unstuck!
 It looks like your terminal session might have reset or exited before you completed the Git steps. No worries—let’s pick up where you left off. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Navigate Back to Your Project Folder

Since you’re at the home directory (
~
), you need to 
go back into your project folder
 first.

Run:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

(Adjust if needed based on your actual Proton Drive path.)

To confirm you’re in the right folder, run:

bash

Copy

ls

✅ 
If you see files like 
package.json
, 
next.config.mjs
, and folders like 
app/
, you're in the right place.

🔹 Step 2: Check if the Rebase is Still in Progress

If you were in the middle of resolving a Git conflict, you need to check the status.

Run:

bash

Copy

git status

If Git says 
“You are in the middle of a rebase”
, continue with these steps:

1️⃣ 
If you already fixed 
.gitignore
, mark it as resolved:

bash

Copy

git add .gitignore

2️⃣ 
Continue the rebase process:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

✅ 
If there are no more conflicts, the rebase will complete.

✅ 
If it still complains about conflicts, open and fix the files, then continue.

🔹 Step 3: Final Push to GitHub

Once the rebase is successful, 
push the updated code to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

✅ 
This will finalize everything and get your code live in GitHub!

🔥 Next: Deploy on Vercel

Once your push goes through, we 
connect it to Vercel
 and get Symbi.world live!

🚀 
Let me know where you’re stuck, and we’ll fix it fast!
