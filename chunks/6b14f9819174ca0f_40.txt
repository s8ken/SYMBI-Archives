You're hitting a swap file issue because Git is opening your commit message in 
vim
 (a terminal-based editor), and there's a leftover crash file.
 No worries, let's fix this fast. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Exit Vim Safely

Right now, Git is waiting for you to 
close the commit message editor
. To exit without making changes, do the following:

1️⃣ 
Press 
Esc

 (just to make sure you’re out of editing mode).

2️⃣ 
Type:

less

Copy

:

q

!

(This tells Vim to 
quit without saving
.)

3️⃣ 
Press 
Enter

🔹 Step 2: Delete the Swap File

Since there’s a leftover 
.swp
 file from a previous Git operation, delete it:

bash

Copy

rm

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website/.git/.COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp

✅ 
This removes the swap file and prevents Vim from blocking your commit.

🔹 Step 3: Resume the Rebase

Now that the swap file is gone, 
run the rebase command again:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

✅ If the commit message editor opens again, 
save and close
:

If using Vim:
 Press 
i
 (to enter insert mode), then 
Esc
, type 
:wq
, and press 
Enter
.

If using Nano:
 Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

🔹 Step 4: Push to GitHub

Once the rebase is successful, 
push the changes
:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

🚀 
This should finally complete everything and sync your repo with GitHub!

Let me know if you hit any more snags—we’re 
so close
 to deployment! 😈🔥

If you're feeling stuck or unsure, you can safely abort the rebase and start fresh.
 This will reset your repo to how it was 
before you ran 
git rebase

, so you can retry.

🔹 Step 1: Abort the Rebase

You have a few options here, but the best move is to delete the swap file so you can continue cleanly.

🔹 Step 1: Delete the Swap File

👉 
Press 
D
 (Delete it)

✅ This will 
remove the old swap file
 and let you continue with the rebase normally.

🔹 Step 2: Resume the Rebase

Once the swap file is deleted, Git should return you to the rebase process.

If it doesn’t, manually run:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

✅ If a commit message editor opens, 
just save and exit
:

For Vim:
 Press 
i
 (insert mode), make edits if needed, then press 
Esc
, type 
:wq
, and press 
Enter
.

For Nano:
 Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

🔹 Step 3: Push the Changes to GitHub

After the rebase completes, 
push your changes with:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

🚀 
This will finally sync everything with GitHub!

💥 Alternative: Abort the Rebase and Retry

If anything still feels off, you can 
abort the rebase
 and start over:

bash

Copy

git rebase --abort

Then try:

bash

Copy

git pull --rebase origin main
git push -u origin main --force

This ensures everything is properly synced before deploying to Vercel.
