You're right at the finish line!
 You're currently inside 
Vim
 (the default Git commit editor) and just need to 
save and exit
 to complete the rebase. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Save and Exit Vim

Since you see:

arduino

Copy

Waiting 

for

 your editor to close the file...

That means Git is waiting for you to 
finalize the commit message and close the editor.

To save and exit Vim, follow these steps:

1️⃣ 
Press 
i

 (to enter insert mode if needed)

2️⃣ 
Make sure the commit message is fine
 (it already looks good: 
"Added Symbi Coming Soon page"
)

3️⃣ 
Press 
Esc

 (exit insert mode)

4️⃣ 
Type:

ruby

Copy

:wq

(This stands for 
Write & Quit
.)

5️⃣ 
Press 
Enter

✅ 
Now Git will finalize the rebase and return you to the terminal.

🔹 Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once you're back in the terminal, 
push your changes to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

✅ 
This will officially update the GitHub repo with your latest changes.

🚀 Next Step: Deploy on Vercel

Once your GitHub repo is updated, 
we’ll connect it to Vercel and get Symbi.world live!

🔥 
Let me know once you've successfully pushed!

No problem!
 Since the 
:wq
 command accidentally got added inside the commit message, you just need to 
redo the commit message correctly
 before finalizing the rebase.

🔹 Step 1: Open the Commit Message Properly

You're still inside Vim, and Git is waiting for a proper commit message. 
Let's clean it up:

1️⃣ 
Press 
i

 to enter insert mode (if not already).

2️⃣ 
Remove any accidental commands (
:wq
 if it got added to the message).

3️⃣ 
Ensure the commit message is clean
, like this:

nginx

Copy

Added

 Symbi Coming Soon page

4️⃣ 
Press 
Esc

 to exit insert mode.

5️⃣ 
Type:

ruby

Copy

:wq

6️⃣ 
Press 
Enter

 to save and exit.

✅ 
Now Git will continue the rebase process correctly.

🔹 Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once back in the terminal, 
run the push command again
 to update GitHub:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

✅ 
This will finalize everything and sync the repo!

Gotcha! You’re inside Vim, and it can be tricky if you're not used to it. Let’s get you unstuck and finish this.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Check If You’re in Insert Mode

Since Vim has different modes, you need to 
exit insert mode first
 before you can type commands.

👉 
Press 
Esc
 multiple times
 to ensure you’re 
out of insert mode.

(If you hear a beep or see nothing happening, that means you’ve successfully exited insert mode.)

🔹 Step 2: Save & Exit Vim

Now, 
type the following exactly
:

ruby

Copy

:wq

✅ 
Then press 
Enter
.

(If 
:wq
 appears inside the commit message again, it means you weren’t out of insert mode—try pressing 
Esc
 first, then retry 
:wq
.)

🔹 Alternative: If Vim Won't Close

If for some reason 
:wq
 isn’t working, try force-quitting without saving:

less

Copy

:

q

!

✅ 
Press 
Enter

(This will 
exit without saving
, and you can restart the commit message if needed.)

🔹 Step 3: Resume the Rebase (If Needed)

If you exited Vim and still need to finish the rebase, run:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

Then 
try saving the commit message again
 following the steps above.

🚀 Next Step: Push to GitHub

Once everything is done, push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

🔥 
You're so close—this is the last step before deployment!
 😈 Let me know if you’re still stuck inside Vim, and I’ll guide you out. 🚀
