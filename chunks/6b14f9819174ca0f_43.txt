You're still in INSERT mode in Vim!
 That’s why 
:wq
 is appearing as text instead of running the command.

🔹 Step 1: Exit INSERT Mode

👉 
Press 
Esc

once or twice
 until you no longer see 
-- INSERT --
 at the bottom.

✅ This takes you out of insert mode so you can enter Vim commands.

🔹 Step 2: Save & Exit Vim

Once you’ve pressed 
Esc
 and you’re out of INSERT mode, type:

ruby

Copy

:wq

✅ 
Then press 
Enter
.

🔥 
That should finally close Vim and let Git continue the rebase!

🔹 Step 3: Push to GitHub

After Vim exits, run:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

✅ 
Now your code should be live in GitHub!

🚀 
Let me know if you need more help—we’re so close!

Got it!
 You're out of 
INSERT mode
, but you're not seeing where 
:wq
 is going. No worries—let’s get this wrapped up properly. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Make Sure You're in Command Mode

You already 
pressed 
Esc

, so 
INSERT mode is gone
—good! Now, do the following:

1️⃣ 
Make sure you don't type anything yet.

2️⃣ 
Carefully type
 (without pressing 
i
 or anything else):

ruby

Copy

:wq

✅ 
It won’t appear in the text area like normal typing—it’s a Vim command.

3️⃣ 
Press 
Enter

🔹 Step 2: If 
:wq
 Still Appears in Text

If 

:wq
 is still appearing in the file as text
, do this instead:

1️⃣ 
Press 
Esc
 multiple times
 to make 100% sure you’re out of insert mode.

2️⃣ 
Try quitting without saving
 (just to test):

less

Copy

:

q

!

✅ 
If that exits Vim, it means your commit message is still fine, and we can redo the rebase if needed.

🔹 Step 3: Resume the Rebase (If Needed)

If you had to quit with 
:q!
, Git will still be waiting for you to continue. Just run:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

✅ 
Then try saving again in Vim.

🔹 Step 4: Push to GitHub

Once you're finally out of Vim, push your changes:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

🚀 
This is the last hurdle before deployment!
 Let me know what happens! 😈🔥

Alright, let’s get around this Vim issue and finish the rebase manually.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Manually Complete the Rebase Without Vim

Since Vim (
vi
) is causing issues, let’s 
tell Git to use a different method
 to complete the commit.

👉 
Try this instead:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

 --no-edit

✅ 
This tells Git to finish the rebase without opening an editor.

🔹 Step 2: If That Doesn’t Work, Use a Manual Commit

If Git still complains, try manually committing the staged changes:

bash

Copy

git commit -m 

"Rebased and resolved conflicts"

git rebase --

continue

✅ 
Now Git should mark the rebase as done.

🔹 Step 3: Push Your Changes to GitHub

Once the rebase is complete, 
push your updated branch
:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

✅ 
Now everything should be synced with GitHub!

🔥 
Let me know if you run into any errors—we're super close to deployment!

Alright, let’s get this sorted manually! Since 
--no-edit
 isn’t recognized, we’ll work around it.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Set a Different Editor (Bypass Vim)

Since Vim (
vi
) is causing issues, let’s 
switch Git to use Nano (easier editor) instead
:

bash

Copy

git config --global core.editor 

"nano"

✅ 
This forces Git to use Nano instead of Vim for commit messages.

Now, try continuing the rebase:

bash

Copy

git rebase --

continue

If Nano opens
