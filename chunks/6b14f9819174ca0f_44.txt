 instead of Vim:

Just 
save and exit
:

Press 
CTRL + X

Press 
Y
 (to confirm saving)

Press 
Enter

🔹 Step 2: If That Doesn’t Work, Do a Manual Commit

If 
git rebase --continue
 still fails, manually commit the changes instead:

bash

Copy

git commit -m 

"Rebased and resolved conflicts"

git rebase --

continue

✅ 
This should let Git finish the rebase.

🔹 Step 3: Push to GitHub

Once the rebase is complete, push your changes:

bash

Copy

git push -u origin main --force

✅ 
Now everything should be fully synced with GitHub!

🔥 
Let me know if you hit any snags! We’re almost there!
