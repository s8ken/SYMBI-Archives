Dependency conflict! But no worries—we can fix this.
 🚀😈

Your build failed because 

react-day-picker@8.10.1
 wants an older version of 
date-fns
, but your project uses 
date-fns@4.1.0

.

🔹 Step 1: Fix Dependencies Locally

Since Vercel is running 
npm install
, let’s 
fix the issue in your local project first
.

1️⃣ 
Go to your project folder in Terminal:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

2️⃣ 
Force-install dependencies to bypass conflicts:

bash

Copy

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

✅ This tells npm to 
ignore peer dependency conflicts
 and install everything.

🔹 Step 2: Verify It Works

Once installation is complete, test locally:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ 
If the site runs locally without issues, then it’s fixed.

🔹 Step 3: Push the Fix to GitHub

If the fix works, push it to GitHub so Vercel can pull the new dependencies:

bash

Copy

git add package-lock.json package.json
git commit -m 

"Fix dependency conflict with date-fns"

git push origin main

🔹 Step 4: Redeploy on Vercel

Once pushed, go back to Vercel and 
redeploy your project
:

1️⃣ 
Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project

2️⃣ Click 
"Redeploy"

✅ This time, it should install without errors!

🔥 
Try these steps and let me know if the build succeeds!

Your system doesn’t recognize 
npm
, which means Node.js is either not installed or not properly set up in your terminal.
 No worries—let’s fix it fast! 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Check If Node.js Is Installed

Run this command to check if Node.js is installed:

bash

Copy

node -v

✅ If it returns a version like 
v18.x.x
, then Node.js is installed.

❌ 
If it says "command not found,"
 you need to install Node.js.

🔹 Step 2: Install or Fix Node.js

If 
node -v
 fails, install Node.js 
via Homebrew (Recommended for Mac users)
:

bash

Copy

brew install node

✅ This will install both 
Node.js and npm
.

If you already installed Node.js but 
npm
 is missing, try:

bash

Copy

brew reinstall node

or force re-link it:

bash

Copy

brew 

link

 --overwrite node

🔹 Step 3: Verify npm Installation

Once installed, check if npm works:

bash

Copy

npm -v

✅ If it returns a version like 
9.x.x
, npm is installed correctly.

🔹 Step 4: Retry the Fix for Dependencies

Now that npm is working, 
rerun the dependency fix
:

bash

Copy

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

✅ 
Once installed, push the fix to GitHub and redeploy on Vercel!

🔥 
Try this and let me know what happens! We’re getting this live today.

YES! npm installed successfully, and dependencies are fixed!
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Verify Everything Works Locally

Now that dependencies are installed, test your project locally:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ 
If the site runs without errors, you’re good to go!

🔹 Step 2: Push the Fix to GitHub

Since we made changes to dependencies, we need to commit and push them:

bash

Copy

git add package-lock.json package.json
git commit -m
