BOOM! Your Next.js app is running locally!

it seems to be thinking or processing - I cent type any new commans

That means your Next.js app is actively running on 
localhost:3000
!
 🚀😈

Since it’s running in the foreground, your terminal is 
locked into the process
, so you can’t type new commands while it’s running.

🔹 What to Do Next?

1️⃣ 
Test Your App in a Browser

Open 
Google Chrome (or any browser)

Go to 

http://localhost:3000

✅ 
If the page loads, everything is working fine!

2️⃣ 
If You Need to Type New Commands:

Press 
CTRL + C

 in the terminal

This 
stops the Next.js server
, and you can type new commands again.

3️⃣ 
Now Push the Fix to GitHub

If everything works locally, let’s push the updates:

bash

Copy

git add package-lock.json package.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed dependency conflicts"

git push origin main

4️⃣ 
Redeploy on Vercel

Go back to 
Vercel Dashboard → Your Project

Click 
"Redeploy"

Vercel will now 
pull your latest changes and deploy them.

🔥 
Try testing the app & let me know what happens!
 If all works fine, we move to 
connecting symbi.world.

loads okay except the logo didn't show and there's an error notification and when I click on that: Console Error

Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used

- A server/client branch 
if (typeof window !== 'undefined')
.
- Variable input such as 
Date.now()
 or 
Math.random()
 which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

- style={{color-scheme:"dark"}}

Good catch!
 This is a 
Next.js hydration error
, meaning the 
server-side rendered (SSR) HTML doesn’t match what the client expects
. 
Let’s fix this issue step by step.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Identify the Cause

This can happen if 
a component relies on client-only values
 like:

✅ 
Date.now()
, 
Math.random()

✅ Checking 
window
 without 
useEffect

✅ External APIs changing data 
without pre-fetching

Common Causes in Your Case:

1️⃣ 
Dark Mode (
className="dark"
)
 → If theme switching logic runs 
differently
 on the server vs client.

2️⃣ 
A Component Using 
window
 Directly
 → Example:

tsx

Copy

if

 (

typeof

window

 !== 

'undefined'

) {

// client-only code

}

This needs to be inside 
useEffect
.

🔹 Step 2: Fix the Hydration Issue
