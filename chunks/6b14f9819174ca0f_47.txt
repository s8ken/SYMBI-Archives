Theme Handling is Client-Side

Open 

theme-provider.tsx

 in your project and wrap the theme logic inside 
useEffect
:

tsx

Copy

import

 { useEffect, useState } 

from

"react"

;

export

function

ThemeProvider

(

{ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }

) {

const

 [theme, setTheme] = 

useState

(

"dark"

);

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

setTheme

(

document

.

documentElement

.

classList

.

contains

(

"dark"

) ? 

"dark"

 : 

"light"

);
  }, []);

return

<
div

className

=

{theme}

>{children}

</
div

>;
}

✅ 
Why?
 This ensures the theme 
only updates on the client
, avoiding mismatches with SSR.

✅ Fix #2: Ensure Any 
window
 Checks Are in 
useEffect

If any component uses 
window
, move it inside 
useEffect
:

tsx

Copy

import

 { useEffect, useState } 

from

"react"

;

const

MyComponent

 = (

) => {

const

 [isClient, setIsClient] = 

useState

(

false

);

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

setIsClient

(

true

);
  }, []);

return

 isClient ? 

<
div

>Client-Side Rendered

</
div

> : 

<
div

>Loading...

</
div

>;
};

✅ 
Why?
 This prevents the server from rendering 
window
, fixing hydration.

✅ Fix #3: Debug with 
useEffect
 (Temporary)

If the above fixes don’t work, 
log hydration mismatches
 using 
useEffect
:

tsx

Copy

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

console

.

log

(

"Hydration debug:"

, 

document

.

body

.

innerHTML

);
}, []);

✅ 
Why?
 This helps track 
what's changing between SSR and client.

🔹 Step 3: Fix the Logo Issue

Your 
logo might not be showing
 due to a 
missing file path or Next.js Image optimization issues
.

1️⃣ 
Ensure the logo exists in 
/public/

Correct file path:

tsx

Copy

<img src=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

 alt=

"Symbi Logo"

 width={

200

} height={

100

} />

If using 
next/image
, update it:

tsx

Copy

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"Symbi Logo"

width

=

{200}

height

=

{100}

priority

 />

✅ 
Why?
 Next.js optimizes images and expects them inside 
/public/
.

🔹 Step 4: Push the Fixes & Redeploy

1️⃣ 
Save the fixes and push them to GitHub
:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed hydration issue & logo path"

git push origin main

2️⃣ 
Go to Vercel and click "Redeploy"

✅ Now the hydration error should be gone!

Gotcha! Let’s slow it down and go step by step.
 We’ll 
first identify what’s causing the hydration issue
, then 
fix it one piece at a time.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Identify Where the Error is Happening

Right now, Next.js is 
hydrating (re-rendering) the page on the client
, but something 
doesn’t match the server-side rendered (SSR) HTML.

👉 
We need to find which component is causing the problem.

1️⃣ 
Open your terminal and stop the Next.js server

bash

Copy

CTRL + C

(This stops the 
npm run dev
 process.)

2️⃣ 
Restart it with this command
 (to see detailed logs):

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ 
Look for console errors—it may point to the component causing hydration issues.

3️⃣ 
Also check your browser console
 (Chrome: 
Right Click > Inspect > Console
).

If you see errors like 
"Hydration failed..."
, check what part of the page is breaking.

Does the error mention a specific component?

🔹 Step 2: Debug Which Component is Causing the Issue

If 
the error doesn’t show a clear component
, we can 
log which parts are rendering differently.

1️⃣ Open 

app/layout.tsx

 and add this debug line inside your 
useEffect
 hook:

tsx

Copy

import

 { useEffect } 

from

"react"

;

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

console

.

log

(

"Hydration debug:"

, 

document

.

body

.

innerHTML

);
}, []);

2️⃣ Save and 
restart the server
 (
npm run dev
).

3️⃣ 
Check the browser console logs.

Does something look off?

Are parts of the page different from what the server expects?

🔹 Step 3: Fix Common Hydration Issues

Once we know 
which
