 component is breaking
, we can fix it.

✅ Fix: If Your Code Uses 
window
 or 
document

Next.js renders on the server first, and 
window
/
document
 don’t exist on the server.

Solution:
 Wrap them inside 
useEffect
.

❌ 
Bad code (causes hydration issues)
:

tsx

Copy

if

 (

typeof

window

 !== 

"undefined"

) {

console

.

log

(

window

.

innerWidth

);
}

✅ 
Fix:

tsx

Copy

import

 { useEffect } 

from

"react"

;

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

console

.

log

(

window

.

innerWidth

);
}, []);

✅ Fix: If Dark Mode or Class Name is Changing

Your error mentions 
className="dark"
 → This means 
your dark mode logic might be running differently on the client vs server.

Solution:
 Move dark mode logic to 
useEffect
 inside 
theme-provider.tsx

🔹 Step 4: Fix the Logo Issue

Your 
logo might not be loading due to the wrong file path
.

1️⃣ 
Check if the logo exists
 inside 

public/

Go to 
public/
 → Look for 

symbi-logo.jpg

If it’s missing, move it into 
public/

2️⃣ 
Update the logo reference in your code

tsx

Copy

<img src=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

 alt=

"Symbi Logo"

 width={

200

} height={

100

} />

✅ 
Why?
 Next.js requires static assets to be inside the 
public/
 folder.

🔹 Step 5: Push Fixes to GitHub & Redeploy

Once you’ve made these changes:

1️⃣ 
Save your files

2️⃣ 
Commit and push to GitHub

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed hydration issue & logo path"

git push origin main

3️⃣ 
Go to Vercel → Click "Redeploy"

No problem! Safari works too.
 Let’s check the console in Safari to see what’s causing the hydration issue. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Open Safari’s Developer Console

Since you’re using Safari, do this:

1️⃣ 
Enable the Developer Menu
 (if not enabled yet)

Go to 
Safari > Settings (Preferences) > Advanced

Check ✅ 
"Show Develop menu in menu bar"

2️⃣ 
Open the Console

Click 
Develop > Show JavaScript Console

Or use the shortcut: 
Command + Option + C

🔹 Step 2: Reload the Page & Check for Errors

1️⃣ 
Go to 
http://localhost:3000

2️⃣ 
Look at the console logs

Do you see the 
hydration error
 again?

Does it mention a 
specific file or component
?

Screenshot the error (or copy-paste it here) so we know exactly what’s breaking.

You said:

[Error] A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch 
if (typeof window !== 'undefined')
.
- Variable input such as 
Date.now()
 or 
Math.random()
 which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
