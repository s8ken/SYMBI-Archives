The error is clear: Next.js requires 
"use client";
 in 
app/layout.tsx
, but it’s still not being recognized properly.
 Let’s 
fix it properly this time.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Modify 
app/layout.tsx
 Properly

1️⃣ Open 
app/layout.tsx
 in 
Nano
:

bash

Copy

nano app/layout.tsx

2️⃣ 
Make sure the very first line is exactly this:

tsx

Copy

"use client"

;

This 
must
 be the very first line, before any imports.

3️⃣ 
Replace everything inside 
app/layout.tsx
 with this:

tsx

Copy

"use client"

;  

// ✅ Ensures this runs only on the client side

import

 { useEffect, useState } 

from

"react"

;

import

 { 

ThemeProvider

 } 

from

"next-themes"

;

import

 { 

Inter

 } 

from

"next/font/google"

;

const

 inter = 

Inter

({ 

subsets

: [

"latin"

] });

export

default

function

RootLayout

(
{
  children,  
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode
}>
) {

const

 [isClient, setIsClient] = 

useState

(

false

);

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

setIsClient

(

true

);
  }, []);

return

 (

<
html

lang

=

"en"

>

<
body

className

=

{inter.className}

>
        {isClient ? (

<
ThemeProvider

attribute

=

"class"

defaultTheme

=

"dark"

enableSystem

=

{false}

>
            {children}

</
ThemeProvider

>
        ) : (

<>

{children}

</>

        )}

</
body

>
    </html>
  );
}

✅ 
Why This Fix Works:

"use client";
 is now 
correctly placed at the top
 (Next.js requires it to be the first line).

Ensures dark mode logic only runs on the client
 to prevent hydration mismatches.

Prevents Next.js from trying to run hooks (
useEffect
, 
useState
) on the server.

🔹 Step 2: Save & Exit

1️⃣ 
Press 
CTRL + X

2️⃣ 
Press 
Y

 (to confirm save)

3️⃣ 
Press 
Enter

 (to exit Nano)

🔹 Step 3: Restart the Next.js Server

Since we changed an important layout file, restart the dev server:

1️⃣ 
Stop the server (if running):

bash

Copy

CTRL + C

2️⃣ 
Restart it:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

3️⃣ 
Test
