okay so that's no good 

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

Alright, let's break it down and fix what’s wrong!
 🚀😈

From the screenshot, I see 
two main issues
:

1️⃣ 
The logo is missing
 (broken image).

2️⃣ 
The page is displaying "Coming Soon" correctly, but something looks off.

🔹 Step 1: Fix the Broken Logo

The most likely reason the 
logo isn’t showing
 is either:

✅ 
The image file is missing from 
/public/

✅ 
The file path is incorrect in your code

🔹 Check if the Logo Exists in 
/public/

Run this command in your terminal:

bash

Copy

ls

 public/

❓ 
Do you see 
symbi-logo.jpg
 or 
symbi-logo.png
 there?

If 
the logo isn’t there
, move it to 
public/
:

bash

Copy

mv

 path-to-your-logo-file public/symbi-logo.jpg

🔹 Update Your Code to Use the Correct Logo Path

Now, open your code where the logo is referenced.

If it’s inside 

app/page.tsx

 or another file, open it:

bash

Copy

nano app/page.tsx

Make sure your 
<img>
 tag looks like this:

tsx

Copy

<img src=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

 alt=

"SYMBI Logo"

 width={

200

} height={

100

} />

OR, if using Next.js' 
next/image
:

tsx

Copy

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"SYMBI Logo"

width

=

{200}

height

=

{100}

priority

 />

✅ 
Why?
 Next.js requires images to be stored inside the 
public/
 folder, and the path should start with 
/
.
