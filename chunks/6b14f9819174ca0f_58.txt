cked applications list.

If it’s not visible, open Proton Drive and try syncing again to trigger a prompt.

2️⃣ Click 
Allow
 or 
Create Rule
 for Proton Drive.

3️⃣ 
Set it to “Allow All Connections”
 (so it won’t block future sync attempts).

4️⃣ Save the changes and close Lulu.

🔹 Step 3: Restart Proton Drive & Let It Sync

1️⃣ Quit 
Proton Drive
 completely.

bash

Copy

Command + Q

2️⃣ Reopen 
Proton Drive
 and check if syncing starts.

🔥 
Once it syncs, you’re back on track!
 😈 Let me know if Lulu still causes issues. 🚀

You said:

you know what its probably because I have the allow apple and allow installed programs check boxes unchecked

🔥 
Yep, that’s definitely it!
 😈 Lulu is blocking everything unless you explicitly allow it.

🔹 Best Fix: Adjust Lulu’s Settings

1️⃣ 
Open Lulu
 (click the menu bar icon).

2️⃣ 
Go to Preferences
 (or Rules).

3️⃣ 
Check these options:

✅ 
Allow Apple-signed programs
 (so system apps work)

✅ 
Allow installed programs
 (so Proton Drive and trusted apps aren’t blocked)

4️⃣ 
Click Save & Restart Lulu.

🔹 Step 2: Manually Allow Proton Drive (If Needed)

If Proton Drive 
still won’t sync
, open Lulu’s 
Rules
 and manually allow it.

Restart 
Proton Drive
 and it should work fine!

🔥 
After this, Proton Drive should sync normally, and you can finish the website push!

You said:

cool - and while we are waiting I also have the code for the actual website I want to be working on - so the dev chat said to create a separate branch? 

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

🔥 
Yes! Creating a separate branch is the best way to work on the actual website while keeping the "Coming Soon" version live.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Create a New Branch for the Main Website

Since you’re currently on the 
main
 branch (which has the "Coming Soon" page), you’ll create a 
new branch
 for the full website.

1️⃣ 
Open Terminal and navigate to your project folder:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

2️⃣ 
Create a new branch called 
main-website
:

bash

Copy

git checkout -b main-website

✅ Now, you’re working in a separate branch where you can build the full website 
without affecting the "Coming Soon" page on 
main
.

🔹 Step 2: Add the Full Website Code

1️⃣ 
Download and extract the full website code from V0.dev.

2️⃣ 
Replace the files in your project folder
 with the full website files.

3️⃣ 
Make sure 
app/layout.tsx
 and 
app/page.tsx
 are updated to match the new design.

🔹 Step 3: Test the New Website Locally

1️⃣ 
Install dependencies (if needed):

bash

Copy

npm install

2️⃣ 
Run the local dev server:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

3️⃣ 
Check 
http://localhost:3000

 to make sure the full website loads properly.

🔹 Step 4: Commit & Push the New Branch

Once everything works:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Started development on the full website"

git push origin main-website

✅ This pushes the full website 
to GitHub, but on a separate branch
 so it won’t replace the live "Coming Soon" page yet.

🔹 Step 5: Deploy the Full Website (Later)

Once you’re ready to launch the full website:

1️⃣ Merge 
main-website
 into 
main
:

bash

Copy

git checkout main
git merge main-website
git push origin main

2️⃣ Redeploy on 
Vercel
 to update the live site.

🔥 
For now, just get the new branch set up and test the full site locally.
 Let me know if you hit any issues! 🚀😈

alright we are synced so what do I run in terminal again to test locally

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

🔥 
Nice! Now that Proton Drive has synced, let’s test the website locally.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Folder

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

bash

Copy

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

✅ This ensures you’re inside the correct project directory.
