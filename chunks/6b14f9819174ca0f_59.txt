f Needed)

If you haven't installed the latest dependencies after syncing, run:

bash

Copy

npm install

✅ This ensures everything is up to date.

🔹 Step 3: Start the Local Dev Server

Run the following command to start Next.js in development mode:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ You should see an output like:

arduino

Copy

✓ Ready in 

1300

ms
Local: http:

//localhost:3000

🔹 Step 4: Open the Website in Your Browser

Go to

http://localhost:3000
 in Safari (or Chrome).

Check the site:

✅ 
Is the background color correct?

✅ 
Is the SYMBI logo displaying?

✅ 
Any errors in the browser console?
 (
CMD + Option + C
 in Safari)

🔹 Step 5: If Everything Looks Good, Push to GitHub

If the site is working fine, 
commit and push the updates:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Updated with V0.dev fixes and synced with Proton Drive"

git push origin main

✅ This ensures that GitHub and Vercel are updated with the latest version.

🔥 
Test it locally and let me know if everything is working as expected!

Dependency conflict again!
 This is the same 
date-fns
 version mismatch issue we fixed before. Let's force npm to install dependencies properly. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Force Install Dependencies

Since 
react-day-picker@8.10.1
 expects an older version of 
date-fns
, we’ll bypass this by running:

bash

Copy

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

✅ 
This tells npm to ignore the dependency conflict and install everything.

🔹 Step 2: If the Issue Persists, Use 
--force

If the first command still fails, try:

bash

Copy

npm install --force

✅ This will 
override
 dependency mismatches and install everything.

🔹 Step 3: Verify Everything Works

Once installed, test locally:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ Open 
http://localhost:3000
 and check if everything is working.

🔹 Step 4: Push Fixes to GitHub

If everything works fine, 
commit and push the updates
:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed dependency issues and updated package-lock.json"

git push origin main

✅ This ensures GitHub and Vercel get the latest fixed dependencies.

🔥 
Try 
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
 and let me know if it works!

Nice! Dependencies installed successfully.
 Now let's move to the final steps. 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Start the Local Server

Now that dependencies are installed, 
run your website locally
:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

✅ This should start your Next.js server and give you a link like:
