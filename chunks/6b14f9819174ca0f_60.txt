 2: Test Your Website

1️⃣ 
Open 
http://localhost:3000
 in Safari (or Chrome).

2️⃣ 
Check the following:

✅ 
Is the background color correct?

✅ 
Is the logo showing?

✅ 
No hydration errors in the console?
 (
CMD + Option + C
 in Safari)

🔹 Step 3: Push Fixes to GitHub

If everything works as expected, 
commit and push to GitHub
:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed dependency issues and tested locally"

git push origin main

✅ 
This ensures GitHub and Vercel are fully updated.

🔹 Step 4: Redeploy to Vercel

1️⃣ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2️⃣ 
Find your project and click "Redeploy"

3️⃣ 
Wait for the build to complete & test the live site!

so it looks great except the logo - do I need to move the logo file I provided to dev chat to the folder?

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

🔥 
Yes! The logo is probably missing from the 
/public/
 folder, so Next.js can't find it.
 Let’s fix that now! 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Move the Logo to the Correct Folder

1️⃣ Find your 
logo file
 (
symbi-logo.jpg
 or whatever it's called).

2️⃣ Move it into the 

public/

 folder inside your project:

bash

Copy

mv

 path-to-your-logo-file public/symbi-logo.jpg

💡 
Example:

bash

Copy

mv

 ~/Downloads/symbi-logo.jpg public/symbi-logo.jpg

✅ 
Now the logo is in the correct place!

🔹 Step 2: Update the Logo Path in Your Code

Now, check the file where the logo is referenced (
layout.tsx
 or 
page.tsx
).

1️⃣ Open the file:

bash

Copy

nano app/layout.tsx

or

bash

Copy

nano app/page.tsx

2️⃣ 
Ensure the logo is referenced correctly like this:

tsx

Copy

<img src=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

 alt=

"SYMBI Logo"

 width={

200

} height={

100

} />

OR
 if using Next.js' 
next/image
:

tsx

Copy

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"SYMBI Logo"

width

=

{200}

height

=

{100}

priority

 />

✅ 
This ensures Next.js correctly loads the image from 
public/
.

🔹 Step 3: Restart the Dev Server & Test

1️⃣ Stop the running server:

bash

Copy

CTRL + C

2️⃣ Restart Next.js:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

3️⃣ Open 
http://localhost:3000
 and check if the 
logo now appears.

🔹 Step 4: Push Fixes to GitHub & Redeploy

If the logo is working:

bash

Copy

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed missing logo issue"

git push origin main

Then 
redeploy on Vercel
:

1️⃣ Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2️⃣ Click 
"Redeploy"

3️⃣ Test the live website!

🔥 
Try this and let me know if the logo shows up now!

You said:

okay so when I went to the public folder I noticed that I couldn't even open the logo jpg file so I deleted it completely and then saved my local copy in the exact same name format as what I removed 

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

🔥 
Smart move! If the file was corrupted or unreadable, replacing it with a fresh copy is the best fix.
 🚀😈

🔹 Step 1: Verify the New Logo File Exists

Since you replaced the logo, let's 
double-check that it's properly in the 
/public/
 folder
:

bash

Copy

ls

 -lh public/

✅ 
You should see something like:

css

Copy

-rw-r

--r--

 symbi-logo.jpg

If you see 
symbi-logo.jpg
, 
you're good to go!

🔹 Step 2: Restart the Dev Server & Test

Now restart your server so Next.js picks up the new file:

1️⃣ Stop the running server:

bash

Copy

CTRL + C

2️⃣ Restart Next.js:

bash

Copy

npm run dev

3️⃣ Open 

http://localhost:3000

 and check if the 
logo now appears.

🔹 Step 3: Push Fix to GitHub & Redeploy

If the logo is working:

bash

Copy

git add public/symbi-logo.jpg
git commit -m 

"Replaced corrupted logo file with a fresh version"

git push origin main

Then 
redeploy on Vercel
:

1️⃣ Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2️⃣ Click 
"Redeploy"

3️⃣ Test the live website!

🔥 
Try this and let me know if the logo is finally showing!
