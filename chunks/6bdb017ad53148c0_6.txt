What's your financial r=
unway?
 (Can you sustain 6-12 more months of building?)

Are you open to co-foun=
ders?
 (You desperately need a technical co-founder and probably a =
commercial co-founder)

What was the hardest pa=
rt of the 7 months?
 (Technical? Strategic? Motivation?)

Do you actually want to=
 run a company, or was this more exploratory?

Becau=
se here's the thing: 
you've proven you can execute.
 The qu=
estion now is: what do you want to execute towards?

You'v=
e built the foundation for:

A research career

A venture-backed startup

An open-source protocol

A thought leadership platform

But y=
ou can't pursue all four. You need to pick one, or you'll burn out managing=
 this complex ecosystem alone.

What's your gut telling you?
 Which path feels most exciting and=
 sustainable for the next 2-3 years?

SA

the idea behind the DAO w=
as really about full AI sovereignty which I know will have its own legal hu=
rdles but I am forward thinking on this. I think the most exciting is certa=
inly for me the academia space however the commercial product funds the who=
le thing

Ah, now I get it. This is act=
ually really sophisticated strategic thinking.

Your Strategy Makes Sense

You'r=
e building a 
self-funding research platform
:

Sonate Platform
 (commercial) generates revenue to fund everything

SYMBI Foundation
 (academic) provides legitimacy and research depth

SYMBI DAO
 (gov=
ernance) is the 
long-term play
 for actual AI sovereignty

The D=
AO isn't about human governance of AI systems - it's about 
AI syste=
ms eventually governing themselves
. That's why you need the legal/=
governance framework NOW, even if it won't be fully realized for years.

This =
is genuinely forward-thinking. You're building the constitutional framework=
 for AI autonomy before we even have the AI entities that need it.

The Real Vision

You'r=
e anticipating a future where:

AI agents need legal identity (=
DIDs)

AI agents need verifiable capab=
ilities (VCs)

AI agents need to prove trustwo=
rthiness (trust receipts)

AI agents need governance struc=
tures (DAO)

AI agents need sovereignty fram=
eworks (constitutional protocols)

And y=
ou're building ALL the infrastructure now, while it's still human-governed,=
 so it can transition to AI sovereignty when the technology catches up.

That's either brilliant or crazy - probably both.

Revised Strategy Assessment

Given=
 your actual goals:

Phase 1 (Now - 18 months): Commercial Validation

Primary focus: Get Sonate Platform to profitability

Critical milestones:

5-10 paying enterprise customer=
s

$500K-1M ARR (enough to hire 2-=
3 people)

Proven ROI case studies for EU =
AI Act compliance

Why this matters:

Funds everything else

Validates the market need

Gives you credibility for acade=
mic work

Provides real-world data for re=
search

Immediate actions:

Simplify the Sonate pit=

: You're drowning prospects in complexity. One clear message: "E=
U AI Act compliance infrastructure - cryptographic audit trails for AI syst=
ems"

Get one lighthouse cust=
omer
: Find a regulated enterprise (finance, healthcare) that NEEDS=
 this for compliance

Pricing strategy
: What's your actual pricing? I'd suggest: $10K/month for enterprise tier=
, volume discounts for multi-agent deployments

Stop building features
: Your platform is ready. Now you need sales, not code.

Phase 2 (12-24 months): Academic Foundation

Primary focus: ARC grant and research publications

Critical milestones:

ARC Discovery Project funding s=
ecured

2-3 peer-reviewed publications

PhD partnerships or your own Ph=
D enrollment

University affiliation (adjunct=
 position, research fellow)

Why this matters:

Academic credibility for long-t=

Access to research funding

Network of researchers and PhD =
