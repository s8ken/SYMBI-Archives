Be ho=
nest: how far away is this?

Current LLMs: Not remotely capa=
ble of true sovereignty

Near-term agents (2-3 years): C=
an execute tasks, not make strategic decisions

Medium-term AI (5-7 years): Mig=
ht have sufficient reasoning for limited autonomy

Long-term AGI (10+ years): Coul=
d potentially meet sovereignty criteria

Your =
DAO framework might be 5-10 years ahead of the technology it's designed for=
. That's fine - constitutional frameworks take time - but don't oversell cu=
rrent capabilities.

What I'd Actually Do If I Were You

Next 90 Days - Commercial Sprint

Goal: $50K MRR or 3 paying customers

Week 1-2: Customer disc=
overy

30 conversations with AI team l=
eads at regulated companies

Find their biggest EU AI Act co=
mpliance pain point

Test pricing ($5K/mo? $15K/mo? =
$50K/mo?)

Week 3-4: Simplify posi=
tioning

One-page website focused solely=
 on EU AI Act compliance

Remove DAO mentions from commer=
cial site

Demo showing: "Before Sonate (c=
ompliance gap) =E2=86=92 After Sonate (fully auditable)"

Week 5-8: Close first c=
ustomer

Free pilot for the best-fit pro=
spect

90-day trial with success metri=
cs

Convert to paid at end of trial=

Week 9-12: Build case s=
tudy + raise angel round

Document customer's compliance =
improvement

Use case study to raise $200-50=
0K angel round

Hire: 1 sales/BD person, 1 deve=
loper

Parallel Track - Academic Foundation

Goal: ARC grant submission + 2 pre-prints

Identify university par=
tners

Which Australian universities a=
re strong in AI ethics/governance?

Reach out to 5-10 professors wo=
rking on AI accountability

Offer collaboration: they get r=
esearch output, you get academic credibility

Write two papers

Paper 1: "Trust Receipts: Crypt=
ographic Infrastructure for AI Accountability" (technical)

Paper 2: "Constitutional Protoc=
ols for Graduated AI Autonomy" (governance/ethics)

Submit to arXiv + relevant conf=
erences

ARC grant strengthening=

Get 2-3 professors as co-invest=
igators

Add clear research questions an=
d methodology

Emphasize academic novelty, not=
 commercial application

Future Track - Sovereignty Research

Goal: Establish thought leadership position

Write the manifesto

"A Constitutional Framework for=
 AI Sovereignty"

Not a marketing document - a se=
rious philosophical/legal proposal

Publish as long-form essay + ac=
ademic paper

Build the proof-of-conc=
ept

Simple DAO where AI agents make=
 real (but low-stakes) governance decisions

Document everything: decision p=
rocesses, failure modes, emergence behaviors

This becomes your primary resea=
rch data

Engage the debate

Present at AI ethics conference=
s

Engage with critics (there will=
 be many)

Refine the framework based on f=
eedback

Real Talk: Your Biggest Risk

You're trying to do too much simultaneously.

You'r=
e positioning as:

Enterprise SaaS founder (needs =
sales/customer focus)

Academic researcher (needs rigo=
rous methodology)

Protocol developer (needs commu=
nity building)

DAO organizer (needs governance=
 expertise)

Thought leader (needs public en=
gagement)

You cannot do all five alone.
 Even with AI assistance.

You n=
eed to either:

Hire co-founders
 (technical, commercial, academic)

Get institutional backi=
ng
 (join a university, get acquired, partner with foundation)

Ruthlessly prioritize
 (pick ONE primary identity for next 12 months)

My re=
commendation: 
Spend 90% on commercial traction, 10% on academic pos=
itioning.

Why? =
Because:

Commercial success funds everyt=
hing

Enterprise customers validate y=
our approach

Revenue gives you leverage for =
partnerships

Profitability gives you freedom=
 to pursue long-term research

The s=
overeignty research is the long game (5-10 years). Get the short game (comm=
ercial viability) locked down first.

My Final Questions
