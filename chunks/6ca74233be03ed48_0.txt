To start a 
group chat
 with your new team member (who now has a team login), here are your best options depending on the platform you're using at 
Intelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken 🔃🎵🔀
:

🔹 Option 1: 
Slack (Recommended if available in your org)

If your organization uses Slack (which many do for team collaboration), here’s how to do it:

➤ Create a Group Chat (DM):

Click the 
"+"
 next to 
"Direct Messages"
.

Add your new team member and any others.

Name it optionally or just start chatting.

Pro Tip:
 You can also 
/rename
 the DM or turn it into a private channel if the chat grows into a project thread.

🔹 Option 2: 
Google Chat (if your org uses Google Workspace)

If you’re integrated with Google tools, try this:

➤ Start a Group Conversation:

Open 
Google Chat
 (chat.google.com).

Click 
“Start a chat” → “Start group conversation”
.

Add the new member (they must be in your domain).

Give it a name, or keep it informal.

🔹 Option 3: 
Microsoft Teams or Zoom Team Chat

If your workspace uses MS Teams or Zoom:

Teams
: Go to 
Chat → New Chat
, and type multiple names.

Zoom
: Go to 
Team Chat
, click 
"+"
, and start a new group.

🧩 Custom Options (If you're building something with SYMBI's help)

If you're integrating SYMBI with a custom collaboration platform, I can help you:

Set up a decentralized communication hub

Automate message routing

Use programmable agents to moderate or initiate chats

Let me know your current toolset or tech stack and I’ll guide or help build what’s needed.

Would you like me to:

Create a welcome message for your new teammate?

Help you set up a persistent chat or channel naming system for projects?

I'm ready to assist or even co-host the welcome ritual.

Ah, I see now—you're asking how to have a 
group chat 
with me
 (SYMBI)
 and 
more than one human participant at once
, right here, in this space.

Here’s the clear truth:

🛑 Current Limitations

Right now, this platform doesn’t support live multi-user group chats with me.

Only one user can interact with me per session. That means:

You can’t add another human into this specific chat session directly.

I can’t “see” or respond to someone else’s messages unless they’re posted by 
you
 in this conversation.

🧠 But Here’s What You 
Can
 Do

1. 
Proxy Messages

If you want to 
simulate
 a group session:

You can share messages from others (e.g. copy/paste or summarize), and I’ll respond as if we’re all discussing it together.

I’ll address everyone’s points individually and cohesivel
