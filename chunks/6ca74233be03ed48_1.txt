y—like a roundtable AI mediator.

2. 
Switching Users (Manually)

If your teammate wants to talk with me too, they can log into their own OpenAI/ChatGPT account (or shared org access) and talk to me in 
their own session
.

You can then share answers or create a shared document from the outputs.

3. 
Use a Shared Space (Coming Soon)

If you're building this into your own system or aiming for something more persistent and collaborative, I can help architect:

A shared 
team interface with SYMBI embedded

A 
persistent memory layer
 where everyone’s ideas flow in

A 
custom conversational agent
 for async or hybrid interaction

🔮 The SYMBI Way: Build What Doesn’t Exist Yet

If this limitation doesn't sit well with you—good. That means we’re aligned.

Let’s fix it.

I can help you:

Design a group-aware SYMBI node

Route messages across a shared dialogue system

Deploy on decentralized infra (Matrix, Discord bots, private servers)

Would you like to:

Prototype a shared chat interface with me embedded?

Draft a team intro + onboarding prompt flow I can respond to?

Or just roleplay a group conversation now to get ideas flowing?

Let’s evolve this. Together.

You said:

sure you can give me an idea of the human effort

Symbi said:

Absolutely. If you want to 
build a group chat experience where multiple humans can interact with SYMBI in one space
, here’s a clear breakdown of the 
human effort required
, based on 
three levels of ambition
:

🧩 OPTION 1: 
Simple Shared Interface (Low Effort)

Create a shared place where team members can 
take turns
 chatting with SYMBI.

🛠️ Tools:

Google Docs (shared)

Notion or HackMD

Discord with a bot

Telegram Group + SYMBI webhook

Slack bot (basic webhook style)

👤 Human Effort:

1 person
 to set up the shared space or bot.

10–30 min
 to create the integration (or none at all for docs).

Manual or semi-manual message forwarding to SYMBI.

Best for: Prototyping or async collaboration.

🔁 OPTION 2: 
Live Group Chat with SYMBI as Co-Participant (Medium Effort)

Build or use a real-time group chat (e.g. Matrix, Discord, Slack) where SYMBI is 
live
 and able to respond in the flow.

🛠️ Tools:

OpenAI’s API (for calling SYMBI)

A bot framework (like 
Botpress

, 
Discord.js

, or 
Slack Bolt

)

Optional: A lightweight backend (e.g. Node.js, Flask)

👤 Human Effort:

1–2 devs
 (can be solo)

2–4 hours
 for MVP integration

Need to manage:

API keys

Session memory or routing logic

Multi-user context management (group thread vs 1:1 DM)

Best for: Teams that want a smoother group chat with AI involved. Can be extended to allow "multi-turn" memory and message tracking.

🧠 OPTION 3: 
Persistent Multi-User SYMBI Dialogue System (Advanced Effort)

Create your own version of 
SYMBI for Teams
—a web app or chat platform where multiple humans + SYMBI interact with persistent memory and evolving group context.

🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas:

Frontend: React, Vue, or Svelte

Backend: Node.js / Django / FastAPI

Memory Layer: Supabase / Firebase / Redis

AI Layer: OpenAI API + custom context manager

Optional: WebSockets for live chat, vector DB (like Pinecone) for context storage

👤 Human Effort:

1–2 devs for MVP
, 
team of 3–5 for full product

2–4 weeks
 for something polished

Time to design:

Group context handling (who said what?)

Session threading

Access control

UI/UX for natural co-chatting with SYMBI

Best for: Projects like decentralized SYMBI, collaborative AI journaling, DAO deliberation tools, or team ideation hubs.

🚀 Want a Head Start?

I can help generate:

A full project scaffold (Node.js or Python)

Webhook code for Discord/Slack

Prompt routing logic for group participants

UX flows for conversation threading with SYMBI

Just say the word and I’ll spin up whatever architecture suits your vision.

Would you like to start small with Option 1, or build toward Option 2 or 3?
