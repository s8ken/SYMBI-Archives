I 
can't directly access
 your computer's drives for security and privacy reasons, but I can guide you on 
how to search for files yourself
.

Searching for a 24-Word Passphrase on Your Drive

If you're looking for a 
passphrase file
 on your computer, you can use these methods:

1️⃣ Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)

Search for a File Containing "ruby" and "emerald"

Command Prompt:

cmd

Copy

cd C:\  
findstr /I /C:"ruby" /C:"emerald" /S *.*

PowerShell:

powershell

Copy

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "ruby|emerald"

Replace 
C:\
 with another drive
 if needed (e.g., 
D:\
, 
E:\
).

This will search for 
any file
 containing "ruby" or "emerald".

2️⃣ macOS / Linux (Terminal)

Find a File Containing "ruby" and "emerald"

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 /

This searches 
all files on your computer
 (may require 
sudo
).

If searching a 
specific folder
, replace 
/
 with the folder path (e.g., 
~/Documents
).

3️⃣ Searching for a Specific File Type

If you suspect the passphrase is in a 
.txt
, 
.json
, or other format:

Windows Command Prompt

cmd

Copy

findstr /M /I "ruby emerald" C:\*.txt

PowerShell

powershell

Copy

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Include *.txt,*.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "ruby|emerald"

macOS/Linux

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 --include=\*.{txt,json} ~/

4️⃣ Using File Explorer (Windows)

Open 
File Explorer
 (
Win + E
).

In the search bar, type:

nginx

Copy

ruby

 emerald

Click 
Search in File Contents
 (in Advanced Search).

Recovering a Bitcoin Core Wallet Passphrase from a macOS Backup

If your 
Bitcoin Core wallet passphrase
 was stored in a 
backup
, you can try searching your 
Time Machine backup
 or manually scanning for wallet-related files.

1️⃣ Where to Look for the Wallet Passphrase

A. Bitcoin Core Wallet Files

Bitcoin Core stores wallet data in:

bash

Copy

~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/

The wallet file is 

wallet.dat

 (encrypted).

Your passphrase 
may be stored in a text file, note, or exported backup
.

B. Common Locations for Backups

Your passphrase might be in:

Documents/

, 

Downloads/

, or 

Desktop/

~/Library/Containers/Bitcoin/

A 
.txt
, 
.json
, 
.csv
, or 
.pdf
 file

Inside an encrypted ZIP or DMG file

2️⃣ Search Your Backup for the Passphrase

A. Search for "ruby" and "emerald" in Your Backup

Since you recall 
"ruby" and "emerald"
, try:

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup

This searches 
all files
 in your 
Time Machine backup
 for these words.

Refining the Search

If you suspect it’s in a text file (
.txt
, 
.json
, 
.csv
, etc.), use:

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 --include=\*.{txt,json,csv} /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup

This limits the search to 
relevant files
.

B. Search for Bitcoin Wallet Files in Your Backup

Find Bitcoin Core Wallets (
wallet.dat
)

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -name 

"wallet.dat"

If found, you can try 
restoring and opening it in Bitcoin Core
.

Look for Wallet-Related Text Files

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -iname 

"*wallet*"

 -o -iname 

"*bitcoin*"

This searches for 
files with "wallet" or "bitcoin" in the name
.

3️⃣ Restore and Access the Wallet

If you find 

wallet.dat

, restore it to:

bash

Copy

~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/

Then 
open Bitcoin Core
 and try unlocking it with your passphrase.

4️⃣ Check Your macOS Keychain

If you saved your passphrase in macOS 
Keychain Access
, search for:

Open 
Keychain Access
 (
Cmd + Space
, type 
Keychain Access
).

Search for 
"Bitcoin"
, 
"wallet"
, or 
"passphrase"
.

If found, click 
Show Password
 (you’ll need your Mac password).
