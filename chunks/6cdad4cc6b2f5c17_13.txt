Recovering Old Stickies Notes from a macOS Time Machine Backup

The macOS 
Stickies
 app stores notes in a 
database file
 that you can recover from your 
Time Machine backup
.

1️⃣ Where to Look for Stickies Notes in Your Backup

A. Stickies Database Location

Stickies notes are stored in:

bash

Copy

~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/StickiesDatabase

Your Time Machine backup might have old versions of this file.

B. Alternative Locations (Older macOS Versions)

Older versions of macOS stored Stickies notes in:

bash

Copy

~/Library/StickiesDatabase

2️⃣ Search for the Stickies Database in Your Backup

A. Locate the Stickies Database

Run this command to 
find all Stickies backups
:

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -name 

"StickiesDatabase"

If found, note the 
oldest version
 (your lost notes may be there).

B. Restore an Old Stickies Database

Copy the backup file to your home folder:

bash

Copy

cp

"/Volumes/TimeMachineBackup/Path_to_StickiesDatabase"

 ~/Desktop/

Replace your current Stickies database:

bash

Copy

mv

 ~/Desktop/StickiesDatabase ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/

Restart Stickies.

3️⃣ Extract Notes from the Database

If Stickies doesn’t load old notes, extract them manually:

A. View Stickies Database Contents

bash

Copy

strings ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/StickiesDatabase

This will 
print all text
 stored inside the file.

B. Extract a Specific Word (e.g., "ruby" or "emerald")

bash

Copy

strings ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/StickiesDatabase | grep -i 

"ruby\|emerald"

If your passphrase was in a Stickies note, this might recover it.

4️⃣ Using Time Machine GUI to Restore Stickies

Open 
Finder
 and go to:

swift

Copy

~/

Library

/Containers/

com.apple.

Stickies

/Data/

Library

/

Open 
Time Machine
 (
Cmd + Space
, search "Time Machine").

Navigate to an 
older backup
 and restore 
StickiesDatabase
.

Restart Stickies.
