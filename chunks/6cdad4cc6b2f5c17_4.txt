Conclusion
:

The two files 
are completely different in content
, not just structurally modified versions of the same dataset.

The hash mismatches are 
not caused by the same type of modifications
, meaning different reasons account for the changes in each file.

If you expected them to be similar or structured the same way, there might have been an 
issue during file retrieval or processing
.

Would you like me to check for additional modifications (e.g., missing sections, different character encodings, or formatting anomalies)? 🔍

the first file seems to have a story at the beginning can you analyse the words and tell me what it says?
