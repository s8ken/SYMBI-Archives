 rather a 
word frequency list
—possibly extracted from Wikipedia or another text corpus.

The presence of "doc", "https", "series", and "film" suggests it could be a 
dataset related to Wikipedia or general knowledge text
.

If you were expecting 
a readable passage
, it might be hidden deeper in the file.

Would you like me to search for 
full sentences or paragraphs
 in the text? 🔍

The file still does not contain 
full sentences or paragraphs
—instead, it consists of 
a long list of words
 arranged in no clear narrative structure.

This confirms that 

english_wikipedia.txt
 is not a story but a dataset of frequently used words
 (possibly for language modeling, text analysis, or AI training).

Would you like me to extract more structured text or look for specific patterns (e.g., names, locations, Wikipedia-like entries)? 🔍 

You said:

how many words are repeated and what is the breakdown?

Each word appears only once
, meaning there are 
no repetitions
 in this dataset.

This suggests the file contains a 
list of unique words rather than a natural t
