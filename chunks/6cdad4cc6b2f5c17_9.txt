what about 24 word pass phrases? 

ChatGPT said:

If you're looking for 
24-word passphrases
, these are commonly used in 
crypto wallets
 (like Bitcoin or Ethereum recovery phrases). These typically follow 
BIP39
 standards, which use a predefined list of 2,048 words.

Since your dataset contains 
large wordlists
, I can generate 
randomized 24-word passphrases
 based on:

Common words
 (
english_wikipedia.txt
)

Names & surnames
 (
female_names.txt
, 
male_names.txt
, 
surnames.txt
)

Other thematic words
 (
us_tv_and_film.txt
)

Would you like me to:

Generate 24-word phrases from your dataset
 (random but human-readable)?

Check if any 24-word sequences appear in the provided files
 (possible passphrase match)?
