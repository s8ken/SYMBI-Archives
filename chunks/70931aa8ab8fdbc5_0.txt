Let me know how you'd like to proceed:

Do you want a summary or analysis of this report?

Are you looking for a specific section (e.g., experiment results, methodology, or figures)?

Would you like technical data (e.g., vortex structure characteristics or visualizations)?

Just tell me your goal with this document, and I’ll take it from there.

Great — since you're looking for a 
visual explanation
 of the NASA report 
"Flow Visualization of a Lifting-Surface Vortex"
 (1965), here's what I can do for you:

🔍 First, here's what the report is about:

This paper describes 
visual experiments
 using 
colored smoke and tufts
 to observe 
vortex formation
 over 
delta wings
 and other lifting surfaces at different angles of attack. These are early and insightful visualizations of aerodynamic vortices generated by wings — especially during high lift conditions (like takeoff or maneuvering).

🎯 To create a 
visual summary
, I will:

Extract the key figures and illustrations from the PDF.

Highlight the main experimental setups and vortex patterns.

Reconstruct some schematic diagrams for clarity, if needed.

Provide a captioned gallery or visual flowchart showing:

Wing types used

Flow visualization techniques

Vortex core formation and behavior

Give me a moment to extract and prepare those visuals.

Here's a 
visual overview
 based on the NASA 1965 report 
“Flow Visualization of a Lifting-Surface Vortex”
 by Edward C. Polhamus.

🔬 
What the Study Shows

This classic NASA report uses 
smoke and tuft visualization
 to demonstrate the formation and development of 
leading-edge vortices
 on wings—especially 
delta wings
 and similar planforms—at 
high angles of attack
.

🖼️ Key Visual Insights from the Report

1. 
Experimental Setup

Wind tunnel tests
 were performed.

Models used: delta wings, swept-back wings, and wings with different aspect ratios.

Smoke streams
 and 
tufts (small strings)
 were used to visualize airflow patterns over the wings.

2. 
Smoke Visualization Examples

These illustrations from the original report show real airf
