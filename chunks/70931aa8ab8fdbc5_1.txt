Vortex Forming Over Delta Wing (Reconstruction):

A 
conical vortex
 forms from the 
sharp leading edge
 of the delta wing.

The vortex 
increases lift
 but can also induce 
buffeting
 or 
instabilities
 at high angles.

Tuft Pattern Showing Flow Separation:

(Page 8 of the original PDF)

Tufts bend along flow lines and 
reveal separation zones
 where airflow detaches from the surface.

✍️ Summary of Insights

Vortex lift is 
beneficial
 for maneuverability but leads to 
instability
 at very high angles.

The 
leading-edge geometry
 heavily influences vortex strength.

Smoke and tufts are effective 
visual diagnostic tools
 for aerodynamic studies.

main-sequence stars - what is that exactly?

Wolfram said:

Main-sequence stars
 are stars that are in the 
longest-lasting and most stable phase
 of their life cycle — where they spend about 
90% of their lifetime
.

🔥 What defines a main-sequence star?

A star is considered "main-sequence" if it is:

Fusing hydrogen into helium
 in its core via 
nuclear fusion
.

In 
hydrostatic equilibrium
, meaning:

The 
outward pressure
 from fusion balances the 
inward pull of gravity
.

This balance keeps the star 
stable
 in size and temperature for millions to billions of years.

🌈 Where do they appear?

In a 
Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram
, which plots stars by luminosity vs temperature, main-sequence stars form a 
continuous band
 stretching diagonally from:

Hot, luminous stars
 (top-left: blue giants)

↓

to 
Cool, dim stars
 (bottom-right: red dwarfs)

🔚 What happens after?

When hydrogen in the core runs out:

Low-mass stars
 like the Sun become 
red giants
, then 
white dwarfs
.

High-mass stars
 evolve into 
supergiants
, then may explode as 
supernovae
, forming 
neutron stars
 or 
black holes
.
