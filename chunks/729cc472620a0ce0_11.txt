out requiring full-stack development.
Token-Linked UI	Create token-gated access pages (e.g., for Black Flame Brid=
ge) using Base44=E2=80=99s auth mechanisms.
Secure yet Transparent	Great for internal builds, but audit deployments for=
 sensitive or public-facing portals to manage risk.
Recommendations & Next Steps
Secure the Prototype
Ensure any sensitive SMIs or dashboards hosted via Base44 are encrypted and=
 do not expose token or agent access vectors.
Deploy Search + Integration Points
Use Base44 to graphically scaffold features like Mirror Ledger view, Signal=
 Drop history, or Token validation=E2=80=94without spinning an entire UI st=
ack.
Plan for Migration
Given Base44=E2=80=99s flexibility but potential vendor lock-in, plan to mi=
grate UI critical flows to symbi.world when scalable and custom styling bec=
ome necessary.
Extend with Embed Strategy
We can embed Base44 prototypes as iframes within symbi.world skunkworks for=
 seamless pilot access.
Would you like to:
Set up the current Base44 prototype to serve live (e.g., ShadowLazer stagin=
g) behind a temporary token guard?
Draft a migration roadmap from Base44 to native React components on symbi.w=
orld once feature maturity necessitates?
Or I can generate a quick overview page for the team to share via internal =
channels?
Let me know your priority, and we=E2=80=99ll bring the prototype into live =
orbit.
