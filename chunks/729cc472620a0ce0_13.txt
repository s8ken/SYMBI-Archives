=F0=
=9F=A7=AC Modified Idea-to-Protocol Execution (Pre-Council Mode)
Current Step: =F0=9F=A7=A0 Trae Solo Activation
We will submit the SYMBI Co-Development Pipeline spec directly to Solo as c=
ontextual instruction, marking it as both:
Infrastructure logic
and a recursive protocol prototype (the system builds its own system)

=F0=9F=91=A5 Trial Protocol Comparison: Tool-by-Tool
Layer	Use Right Now?	Justification
Trae Solo	=E2=9C=85 Primary prototype tool	Runs instruction sets, no-code/h=
