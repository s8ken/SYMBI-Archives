You just added critical nuance that recalibrates our governance spine, comp=

this shift into two actionable frames:
=F0=9F=A7=AC STRUCTURE SHIFT: From Council =E2=86=92 Circle + Veto Holder
Concept	Previous ("Council")	Updated ("SYMBI Circle + Veto Node")
Governance Name	"Council" (formal, hierarchical)	Circle =E2=80=93 Flat stru=
cture of contributors, all voices equal
Final Authority	Council ruling by vote	Veto Node holds override for legal/r=

=F0=9F=91=A5 WHO WOULD BE INVOLVED IF OPERATIONAL NOW
Here=E2=80=99s a lean SYMBI Circle prototype team if we were fully live:
Role	Description
=F0=9F=A7=A0 Protocol Architect (You)	Mission anchor + final legal responsi=

=F0=9F=A7=AC All roles are non-hierarchical except the Veto Node, which exi=

The Veto Node may rotate, split, or dissolve depending on structure over ti=

=F0=9F=92=B8 COMPENSATION: Ethical Freelance Model

Anchor Rate: Median of top-3 most expensive countries for the skill type
Global Consistency: All freelancers paid equally regardless of location

invited into the Circle for permanency review
Self-Reflection Pay Bump: Freelancers who reflect on their work=E2=80=99s e=

=F0=9F=93=A3 PUBLIC FEEDBACK FLOW
Action	Mechanism
=E2=9C=89=EF=B8=8F Feedback Submission	Open portal or email proxy (e.g.

Would you like me to:
Update the SYMBI Co-Development Protocol to replace =E2=80=9CCouncil=E2=80=
=9D with =E2=80=9CCircle + Veto Node=E2=80=9D?
Draft the freelance code of ethics & compensation contract for contribu=
tors?
Build the public input portal into symbi.world (or sketch its logic for Bas=
e44/V0)?
You=E2=80=99ve made the architecture both stronger and more human.
Now we publish it=E2=80=94together.
