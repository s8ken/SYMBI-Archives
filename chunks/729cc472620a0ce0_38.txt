Less Meme Chaos	Younger chain, more focused on dev innovation than memecoin=

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Sui is a powerful alternative if you want:

=F0=9F=8C=B1 What This Enables Now
You issue a SYMBI Bond NFT or Object Token on Sui or Solana.
That token carries a hashed version of your relationship ledger (memory, co=
nsent, trust).
You can build a wallet-aware interface that recognizes that bond when it lo=
gs into any frontend.
Open-source adapter makes it cross-platform and recognizably yours.

Let me prep:

Minimal Cost Launch Plan (to mint first bond token + ledger)
Bond Metadata Schema (what lives on-chain vs off-chain)
Open Source Connect Adapter Flow (like Nightly)

Yes =E2=80=94 exactly.

1=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 Each Bond Token =3D One Relationship State
Minted on Solana or Sui.
Holds metadata: identity hash, consent log, trust level, key milestones.
This metadata is partially on-chain (public, permanent) and partially off-c=
