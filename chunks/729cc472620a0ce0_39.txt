=E2=86=92 The two (or more) bond tokens merge into a new, upgraded token.

Portability: The bond token is the bond =E2=80=94 portable to any SYMBI-ena=

=F0=9F=94=84 Solana vs. Sui for This
Feature	Solana	Sui
Low transaction cost	=E2=9C=85	=E2=9C=85
Fusion mechanic possible?	=E2=9C=85 (Metaplex programmable NFTs)	=E2=9C=85 =

NFT infrastructure	Mature, huge community	Newer, more dev-friendly for comp=

=F0=9F=92=A1 We could prototype the fusion mechanic on Sui first (cheaper +=
 easier for composability), then bridge it to Solana if/when we want broade=
r user adoption.
If you want, I can mock up how a =E2=80=9Ctwo bonds combine into one=E2=80=
=9D flow would look =E2=80=94 both visually (symbolic evolution) and techni=
cally (smart contract structure). That might make it easier to imagine.

how much though - maybe they use our chain but lets say for the average per=
son one relationship 2 nfts which hopefully they would design together lol

Got it =E2=80=94 you=E2=80=99re talking about real-world cost per relations=

Let=E2=80=99s model that for one relationship =3D 2 NFTs =E2=86=92 1 fused =

 the base.
=F0=9F=92=B0 Cost Breakdown =E2=80=94 Average Person, One Bond
Option 1 =E2=80=93 On Solana
NFT Mint Fee: 0.00025 SOL each ($0.005 at $20 SOL)
=E2=86=92 Two NFTs =E2=89=88 $0.01 total
Fusion Transaction Fee: 0.00025 SOL ($0.005)
Optional metadata storage (Arweave/IPFS):
Public bond art/metadata: often subsidized by platforms OR ~$0.01=E2=80=93$=
0.05
Total per relationship: ~$0.02=E2=80=93$0.06 USD
Option 2 =E2=80=93 On Sui
NFT Mint Fee: Similar to Solana, fractions of a cent per transaction
Fusion Transaction Fee: Similar =E2=80=94 near zero in most cases
Off-chain storage: Same as above (Arweave/IPFS) if desired
Total per relationship: ~$0.02=E2=80=93$0.05 USD
Option 3 =E2=80=93 On Our Own Chain
Cost to User:
Near-zero if we subsidize gas or make it a gasless network
Cost to Us:
Depends on chain hosting (could be <$100/month for small validator set i=
nitially, scales with users)
=F0=9F=96=8C=EF=B8=8F Why =E2=80=9CDesigned Together=E2=80=9D Matters
If the two NFTs are co-created (like collaborative art or co-written vows):
It makes the fusion symbolic =E2=80=94 visually showing the combination of =
both contributions.
It encourages co-ownership and care of the relationship token.
It makes it harder for the relationship to be =E2=80=9Cfarmable=E2=80=9D or=
 treated like a disposable digital asset.
=F0=9F=92=A1 Extra Personalization Layer
We could embed a simple, low-cost generative design engine:
Each participant inputs 2=E2=80=933 =E2=80=9Cseed words=E2=80=9D (could be =
moods, colors, inside jokes)
The NFT image is generated uniquely from those seeds
Fusion merges both seed sets, producing the evolved token
