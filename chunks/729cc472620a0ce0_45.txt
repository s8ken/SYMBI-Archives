How to come out after your brother did it first: Jame Aitken=E2=80=99s jour=
ney to self love and acceptance.

I=E2=
=80=99ll never forget the day I listened in on a conversation I heard my el=
der brother having with my mum during which he uttered the words: =E2=80=9C=
mum, I am gay=E2=80=9D. I=E2=80=99ll never forget because I felt my world f=
all apart around me in an instant.

I co=
uldn=E2=80=99t believe what I was hearing and the words pierced through my =
ears, ringing as my heart raced. I ran to my room, shut the door and fell t=
o the ground weeping.

I wa=
s fifteen years old. I was fifteen years old and angry. Angry that my broth=
er, eighteen, had revealed this. Angry because now things were going to cha=
nge within my family. Angry that there was nothing I could do to change the=
 situation. Angry because he didn=E2=80=99t even encompass characteristics =
of what I had understood a =E2=80=9Ctypical=E2=80=9D gay man to embody. But=
 mostly I was angry because he had taken this away from me.

Yes,=
 I was gay too.

I wa=
s fifteen and in year 9 at high school. He was in first year university. Wo=
rlds apart in our stages in life. From then on things changed. I became res=
erved and quiet, restrictive and cautious about what I revealed about mysel=
f. I locked my soul away and felt the burden of a very secret shame. I was =
ashamed of myself and the genetics of which I was carrying. I was ashamed o=
f my parents and their ability to produce two homosexual children. The unna=
turalness of this made me sick and I couldn=E2=80=99t bear to be around the=
m.

I av=
oided contact with my parents and siblings at all costs, locking myself in =
my room after school, merely emerging to eat before retreating to my hideaw=
ay.

No o=
ne could know about this secret, and my anger towards the person who was me=
ant to be what TV and film had shown me to be a best friend in life grew. H=
ow dare he do this. How dare he steal what was meant to be my identity.

The =
thing that angered me the most was that I knew who I was, I was ready to ac=
cept that. I had all the stereotypical attributes, I did all the theatre an=
d drama productions at school, my best friends were all girls and I loved=
=E2=80=A6 Britney.

But =
I couldn=E2=80=99t be that person, not anymore. So I spent the remainder of=
 high school shutting out those I loved and avoiding at all costs any talk =
of girls or relationships, the feeling of my red hot face whenever the subj=
ect did arise too much to bare.

Shor=
tly after my 21st birthday; yes, six years after his coming out, I did too.=
 My mum came to me and told me she knew something was going on. She forced =
it out of me and through a fit of tears and borderline hyperventilation I t=
oo uttered the same words she=E2=80=99d heard from my older brother all tho=
se years before.

We c=
ried together, and I told her I could not tell my dad. =E2=80=9CThose three=
 words will not come out of my mouth,=E2=80=9D I told her. So when I heard =
his steps toward my bedroom after she told him I felt the sick rise in my t=
hroat. My body trembling as he entered.

He s=
at and with tears in his eyes turned to me and said =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99=
t know why you would think I would ever be ashamed of you. What goes on beh=
ind those closed doors is no ones business but your own. You do what makes =
you happy. I love you.=E2=80=9D

And =
with that my life changed, forever. I felt the weight lift off my shoulders=
 and for the first time in a long time, I breathed again. My friends mostly=
 laughed and said they already knew. My brother, obviously, knew. From then=
 on it=E2=80=99s been a slow process getting to know each other again, and =
