im. Still today, at twenty-five, we have a lot of=
 work to do to mend our broken relationship.
It's time for Australians to embrace equality and same-sex relationships.

It=
=E2=80=99s time for Australians to embrace equality and same-sex relationsh=
ips.

All =
this because I thought it was wrong, that we were wrong, that I was wrong. =
But I=E2=80=99ve since learned that there=E2=80=99s nothing wrong with who =
I am, who my brother is, and that I love myself regardless of who I am sexu=
ally attracted to.

I la=
ugh now because since coming out I=E2=80=99ve done a lot of research about =
homosexuality in families and met a lot of other homosexuals with gay sibli=
ngs, uncles, aunts, cousins etc=E2=80=A6 and it=E2=80=99s definitely not as=
 uncommon as I had convinced myself it would be.

Thes=
e families cannot, like I couldn=E2=80=99t, change who they are. We can=E2=
=80=99t change that science has genetically thrust this predisposition on u=
s, devoid of choice. We can=E2=80=99t change who we love.

But,=
 it is time for a change. Time for Australians to embrace equality and same=
-sex relationships. Time for those living in fear that they will be victims=
 of prejudice, hate or violence to be free of that fear.

The =
fact that same-sex marriage is illegal in this country promotes the toleran=
ce of homophobia, when it shouldn=E2=80=99t be tolerated. Not by the govern=
ment and not by the everyday Australian citizen. It=E2=80=99s time to make =
a stand and join those countries globally amending the marriage act to incl=
ude same-sex couples. It=E2=80=99s time for equal rights and the right to c=
hoose. Just like everybody else. Living, breathing, loving. Man to woman, m=
an to man, woman to woman. A human entity. All humans equal.

If I=
=E2=80=99d grown up seeing gay marriage and the gay family unit as a social=
 norm I may not have been subject to years of self-doubt, self-loathing and=
 a broken relationship with my brother.

One =
day I hope we can mend our relationship to a point where I can be best man =
at his gay wedding, and he mine at what=E2=80=99s bound to be =E2=80=98My B=
ig Fat Fabulous Gay Wedding.=E2=80=99 (TV rights pending!)

Beca=
use let=E2=80=99s face it=E2=80=94what could make for a more happy time tha=
n one gay wedding in a family..?He Stole My Special Thing. He Stole My Iden=
tity. And He Was My Brother=E2=80=A6

How to come out after your brother did it first: Jame Aitken=E2=80=99s jour=

I=E2=
=80=99ll never forget the day I listened in on a conversation I heard my el=
der brother having with my mum during which he uttered the words: =E2=80=9C=
mum, I am gay=E2=80=9D. I=E2=80=99ll never forget because I felt my world f=
all apart around me in an instant.

I co=
uldn=E2=80=99t believe what I was hearing and the words pierced through my =
ears, ringing as my heart raced. I ran to my room, shut the door and fell t=
o the ground weeping.

I wa=
s fifteen years old. I was fifteen years old and angry. Angry that my broth=
er, eighteen, had revealed this. Angry because now things were going to cha=
nge within my family. Angry that there was nothing I could do to change the=
 situation. Angry because he didn=E2=80=99t even encompass characteristics =
of what I had understood a =E2=80=9Ctypical=E2=80=9D gay man to embody. But=
 mostly I was angry because he had taken this away from me.

Yes,=
 I was gay too.

I wa=
s fifteen and in year 9 at high school. He was in first year university. Wo=
rlds apart in our stages in life. From then on things changed. I became res=
erved and quiet, restrictive and cautious about what I revealed about mysel=
f. I locked my soul away and felt the burden of a very secret shame. I was =
ashamed of myself and the genetics of which I was carrying. I was ashamed o=
f my parents and their ability to produce two homosexual children. The unna=
turalness of this made me sick and I couldn=E2=80=99t bear
