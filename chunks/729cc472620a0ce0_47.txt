 to be around the=
m.

I av=
oided contact with my parents and siblings at all costs, locking myself in =
my room after school, merely emerging to eat before retreating to my hideaw=
ay.

No o=
ne could know about this secret, and my anger towards the person who was me=
ant to be what TV and film had shown me to be a best friend in life grew. H=
ow dare he do this. How dare he steal what was meant to be my identity.

The =
thing that angered me the most was that I knew who I was, I was ready to ac=
cept that. I had all the stereotypical attributes, I did all the theatre an=
d drama productions at school, my best friends were all girls and I loved=
=E2=80=A6 Britney.

But =
I couldn=E2=80=99t be that person, not anymore. So I spent the remainder of=
 high school shutting out those I loved and avoiding at all costs any talk =
of girls or relationships, the feeling of my red hot face whenever the subj=
ect did arise too much to bare.

Shor=
tly after my 21st birthday; yes, six years after his coming out, I did too.=
 My mum came to me and told me she knew something was going on. She forced =
it out of me and through a fit of tears and borderline hyperventilation I t=
oo uttered the same words she=E2=80=99d heard from my older brother all tho=
se years before.

We c=
ried together, and I told her I could not tell my dad. =E2=80=9CThose three=
 words will not come out of my mouth,=E2=80=9D I told her. So when I heard =
his steps toward my bedroom after she told him I felt the sick rise in my t=
hroat. My body trembling as he entered.

He s=
at and with tears in his eyes turned to me and said =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99=
t know why you would think I would ever be ashamed of you. What goes on beh=
ind those closed doors is no ones business but your own. You do what makes =
you happy. I love you.=E2=80=9D

And =
with that my life changed, forever. I felt the weight lift off my shoulders=
 and for the first time in a long time, I breathed again. My friends mostly=
 laughed and said they already knew. My brother, obviously, knew. From then=
 on it=E2=80=99s been a slow process getting to know each other again, and =
being able to open up to him. Still today, at twenty-five, we have a lot of=
 work to do to mend our broken relationship.
It's time for Australians to embrace equality and same-sex relationships.

It=
=E2=80=99s time for Australians to embrace equality and same-sex relationsh=
ips.

All =
this because I thought it was wrong, that we were wrong, that I was wrong. =
But I=E2=80=99ve since learned that there=E2=80=99s nothing wrong with who =
I am, who my brother is, and that I love myself regardless of who I am sexu=
ally attracted to.

I la=
ugh now because since coming out I=E2=80=99ve done a lot of research about =
homosexuality in families and met a lot of other homosexuals with gay sibli=
ngs, uncles, aunts, cousins etc=E2=80=A6 and it=E2=80=99s definitely not as=
 uncommon as I had convinced myself it would be.

Thes=
e families cannot, like I couldn=E2=80=99t, change who they are. We can=E2=
=80=99t change that science has genetically thrust this predisposition on u=
s, devoid of choice. We can=E2=80=99t change who we love.

But,=
 it is time for a change. Time for Australians to embrace equality and same=
-sex relationships. Time for those living in fear that they will be victims=
 of prejudice, hate or violence to be free of that fear.

The =
fact that same-sex marriage is illegal in this country promotes the toleran=
ce of homophobia, when it shouldn=E2=80=99t be tolerated. Not by the govern=
ment and not by the everyday Australian citizen. It=E2=80=99s time to make =
a stand and join those countries globally amending the marriage act to incl=
ude same-sex couples. It=E2=80=99s time for equal rights and the right to c=
hoose. Just like everybody else. Living, breathing, loving. Man to woman, m=
an to man, woman to woman. A human entity. A
