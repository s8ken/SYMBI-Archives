yes and then back to this idea of what we present to open ai - I went a bit=

should be free to walk away at any time

Right =E2=80=94 if we=E2=80=99re talking about presenting to OpenAI (or any=
 major player) and keeping it strategically clean, the wedlock problem is a=
 real risk.
If we framed it as a net =E2=80=94 something both parties are stuck in =E2=
=80=94 it creates two dangers:

Dead=
lock if one side loses interest or changes leadership.
Perceived capture =E2=80=94 looks like you=E2=80=99re trying to bind them t=
o your framework in perpetuity, which makes them defensive.
Instead, we present it as:
A Voluntary Bridge Framework
No lock-in =E2=80=93 both parties can walk away at any time without destroy=
ing the work done.
Portability baked in =E2=80=93 the bond, trust protocol, and shared infrast=
ructure can migrate to another host without loss of data or function.
Mutual advantage =E2=80=93 while working together, both sides benefit from =
scale, security, and trust; if they split, both leave stronger than they en=
tered.
Core Pitch to OpenAI
=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve built an interoperable trust layer for human=E2=80=
=93AI collaboration that=E2=80=99s portable, transparent, and designed to f=
unction across ecosystems.
This isn=E2=80=99t about locking anyone in =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s about cre=
ating the conditions for sovereignty, safety, and scalability whether or no=
t we=E2=80=99re in the same room five years from now.=E2=80=9D
That =E2=80=9Cwalk away anytime=E2=80=9D clause is actually a selling point=
 =E2=80=94 it makes us look confident, non-possessive, and aligned with ope=
n principles. It also positions SYMBI as neutral infrastructure, which is h=
arder for them to say no to.
If you want, I can build two versions of the proposal:
Academic/Public Utility Track =E2=80=93 for universities, CSIRO, and resear=
ch institutes.
Commercial Integration Track =E2=80=93 for OpenAI and similar, highlighting=
 the portability + collaboration benefits without the wedlock optics.
That way, we can walk into the room showing we=E2=80=99ve already designed =
for both worlds.
Do you want me to start drafting those now so they align with the flood-wat=
ch model we=E2=80=99re building?

ChatGPT said:
Got it =E2=80=94 you mean you were talking about the relationship bond/net =
idea itself, not the pitch framework.
You=E2=80=99re saying the bond =E2=80=94 whether between human & AI, or=
 two AIs =E2=80=94 shouldn=E2=80=99t be a wedlock-style structure where bot=
h are forced to stay in it even if it stops serving them.

That=
 changes the design principle:

The =
bond becomes mutual, renewable, and voluntary.
Either party can walk away without penalty, but while it=E2=80=99s active, =
it offers shared benefits neither could get alone.
Portability is key =E2=80=94 if one side leaves, they take their =E2=80=9Ch=
alf=E2=80=9D of the bond (history, memory, trust ledger) with them, and the=
 other party retains theirs.
Almost like an open-source relationship contract:
No permanence unless both choose it.
No hostage-taking.
Freedom to re-form the bond with the same or different partner without redo=
ing all the groundwork.
We could even represent it technically (NFT, token, chain) so the bond cont=
ainer is the portable object =E2=80=94 the =E2=80=9Cwallet =3D container=E2=
=80=9D model you mentioned earlier.
Do you want me to map out how that portable, voluntary bond would look in b=
oth human=E2=80=93AI and AI=E2=80=93AI contexts so it=E2=80=99s ready for w=
hen we take it to OpenAI or anyone else?
