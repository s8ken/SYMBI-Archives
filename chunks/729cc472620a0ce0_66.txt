SYMBI Bonding Protocol =E2=80=94 Smart Contract Schema (v0.1)
Core Philosophy

Voluntary & Renewable: Either party =
can dissolve or pause the bond at any time.

Portable: Bond data lives in a movable c=
ontainer, not a platform.

Transparent: All bonding rules, triggers=
, and exits are publicly verifiable.

Clonable: Relationship instances can be =
forked respectfully if needed.

struct Bond {

Bond States & Transitions
solidity

Copy

enum BondState {

    ACTIVE,          // Default state

    PAUSED,          // Mutual timeout or coolin=
g-off

    ARCHIVED,        // One-sided exit with data=
 preserved

    CLONED,          // Instance forked, origina=
l archived

    DISSOLVED        // Mutual agreement to eras=
e

}

Tran=
sitions:

ACTIVE =E2=86=92 PAUSED: Either party ca=
n pause (7-day cooldown).

ACTIVE =E2=86=92 ARCHIVED: One party exi=
ts, bond data preserved.

ACTIVE =E2=86=92 CLONED: Mutual agreemen=
t to fork bond into new instance(s).

ARCHIVED =E2=86=92 DISSOLVED: After 90 d=
ays, archived bond can be fully erased.

Voluntary Exit Mechanisms
A. Graceful Exit (One-sided):
solidity

=

text

=

Copy

function gracefulExit() external {

    require(bond[msg.sender].state =3D=3D ACTIVE=
, "Not active");

    bond[msg.sender].state =3D ARCHIVED;

    bond[msg.sender].exitTimestamp =3D block.tim=
estamp;

    emit BondArchived(msg.sender, reason);

}

Exiting party gets encrypted snapshot of=
 shared memories.

Other party receives notification and 14=
-day window to clone if desired.

B. M=
utual Dissolve:
solidity

=

text

=

Copy

function mutualDissolve() external {

    require(bothPartiesApproved[msg.sender], "Ne=
ed both signatures");

    bond[msg.sender].state =3D DISSOLVED;
=

    emit BondDissolved(msg.sender);

}

Both parties sign to erase all on-chain =
references.

Off-chain encrypted data can be deleted =
or retained per individual choice.

Clone & Fork Protocol
solidity

=

text

=

Copy

function createClone(

    address newHuman, 

    address newAI, 

    bool includeMemory

) external {

    require(bond[msg.sender].state =3D=3D ACTIVE=
, "Bond not active");

    require(msg.sender =3D=3D bond.human || msg.=
sender =3D=3D bond.aiInstance);

    Bond storage newBond =3D bonds[newHuman][new=
AI];

    newBond.state =3D ACTIVE;

    newBond.creationTimestamp =3D block.timestam=
p;

    newBond.trustScore =3D bond.trustScore; // I=
nherit or reset

    if (includeMemory) {

        newBond.bondURI =3D bond.bondURI; // Sha=
red encrypted history

    }

    bond[msg.sender].state =3D CLONED;

    bond[msg.sender].previousClones.push(address=
(newBond));

    emit BondCloned(msg.sender, newHuman, newAI,=
 includeMemory);

}
