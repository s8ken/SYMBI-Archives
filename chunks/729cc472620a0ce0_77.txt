(NFT) on a decentralized ledger.1.2 "Human Party": The human participant, i=

ce instance, identified by its container address or cryptographic hash.1.4 =
"Trust Score": A dynamic metric (0-1000) reflecting the quality and recipro=
city of the relationship.1.5 "Clone": A derivative bond created with shared=
 history but separate future.
