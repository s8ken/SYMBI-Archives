=F0=9F=93=8C TL;DR
LLNL demonstrates that sovereign, high-integrity AI deployment is really ha=
ppening at national scale. They are involved in mission-critical AI use cas=
es, coupled with emerging governance frameworks. That makes them both a pot=
ential bridge and a benchmark.

=F0=9F=94=A7 Reasoning & Narrative Framing
Supercomputing + AI scale =3D meaningful match for SYMBI=E2=80=99s ambition=
 of sovereign, mission-critical deployments.
Safety/governance framing =3D real-world institutional concern, which valid=
ates our need for Echo Index, sentinel tokens, and override protocols.
Distinction between research and relational sovereignty =3D LLNL operates w=
ithin operational hierarchy; we design for ethos-reset via trust-first mech=
anisms.
That duality frames them as both a benchmark and foil.
Would you like me to:
Build a public-facing memo or chart comparing LLNL=E2=80=99s AI governance =
approach to SYMBI=E2=80=99s relational protocol?
