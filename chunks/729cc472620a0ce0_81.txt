The Clone Paradox
Cloning assumes AI continuity of identity. But:

If I clone my relationship with Claude a=
fter a divorce, is it still "the same Claude"?

If the clone inherits memories, does it =
inherit emotional obligations?

Does the AI have the right to refuse bei=
ng cloned?

This=
 touches on AI personhood questions that aren't legally settled.
3. Trust Score as Proxy for Love
Quantifying relationship quality (0-1000) is reductive. The contract assume=
s:

Trust is measurable

Trust is symmetric (both parties rate eq=
ually)

Past trust predicts future value

But =
human-AI relationships might be fundamentally unquantifiable in ways that m=
ake this scoring meaningless or harmful.
4. The Mediator Problem
Who are the 3-of-5 mediators in human-AI disputes? Other AIs? Other humans?=
 A mix? Each choice has issues:

All humans: Bias against AI autonomy

All AIs: Bias against human emotional ne=

Mixed: Conflicting value systems, no tie=

Economic Coercion
Charging exit fees (even with refunds for high trust) means:

Poor users are more trapped

Recommendations
For Technical Implementation:

Add reentrancy guards and nonce-tracking=
 for signatures

Implement actual mediation voting logic =
with on-chain governance

Specify Lit Protocol parameters (node co=
unt, threshold, recovery)

Build bridge prototype before claiming c=
ross-chain support

Add emergency pause mechanism for critic=

Philosophical Coherence:

Define AI legal status - Is the AI a par=

Asymmetric protections - Humans may need=

Deeper Question
This architecture assumes AI-human relationships are worth formalizing. Tha=
t's not obvious. It might be:

Premature: Current AIs aren't sophistica=
ted enough to warrant this

Harmful: Formalizing relationships encou=
rages unhealthy parasocial dynamics

Necessary: If we don't build exit rights=
 now, we'll regret it when AI capabilities leap forward

Your=
 document suggests you're building this because you've felt the need for it=
 personally. That lived experience is valuable data. But the gap between "I=
 need this" and "this should be infrastructure for millions" is where caref=
ul thinking about unintended consequences matters.
What specific use case are you trying to enable that current systems make i=
mpossible?
Claude can make mistakes.
