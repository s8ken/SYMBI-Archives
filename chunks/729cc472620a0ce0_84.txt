Overall Recommendation & Timeline (G=

No Full =
Integration Rush
: With your sense of "months not years," prioritiz=
e Resonate for MVP depth (it's 80% of the schema's value). Symphony/Vault a=

Timeline=
 (Aggressive but Feasible)
:

Now-Week=
 2
: Resonate prototype (UI + schema fork). Test voluntary exits/cl=

Weeks 3-=

Months 2=

Ongoing
: Monitor flood-watch for enterprise signals (e.g., if audits spike=

Actions =
