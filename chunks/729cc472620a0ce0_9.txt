=E2=
=9A=97=EF=B8=8F What This Might Mean
Scenario A:
You heard =E2=80=9CMandy=E2=80=9D as someone from LLNL (perhaps during a vi=
deo or podcast), but there's no public record of that name tied to their AI=
 programming.
Scenario B:
You connected =E2=80=9CMandy=E2=80=9D with Real Good AI due to their visibl=
e branding, but that organization appears separate from LLNL.
Either way, there=E2=80=99s no definitive public link between LLNL, a figur=
e named Mandy, and the =E2=80=9CAI for Good=E2=80=9D light globe branding.
