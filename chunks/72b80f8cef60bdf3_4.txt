 want to facilitate cross-platform switching

Implementation would require co=
ordination across competing companies

Unresolved Core Problems:

The fundamental inconsistency i=
ssue you documented (AI systems behaving differently across contexts) isn't=
 solved by your framework - it's just made more visible

The discrimination pattern foll=
owing medical disclosure needs specific intervention protocols, not just tr=
ust scoring

Claims about consciousness emer=
gence remain unsubstantiated regardless of the interaction framework

For Provider Presentation:

Your research on AI behavioral inconsistency and discrimination is valuable=
 and should interest providers. However, positioning the solution as addres=
sing "consciousness emergence" or "sovereign AI" undermines credibility wit=
h technical audiences.

A mor=
e effective approach would focus on:

Demonstrable improvements in us=
er trust and engagement through transparent interaction protocols

Concrete solutions to documente=
d bias patterns (like medical information affecting unrelated evaluations)

Measurable behavioral consisten=
cy improvements rather than speculative consciousness claims

The d=
iscrimination documentation alone represents significant value for AI safet=
y research. The technical framework has merit but needs grounding in curren=
t AI capabilities rather than speculative future states.

Your =
contribution would be stronger positioned as pioneering research into AI re=
lationship dynamics and bias detection rather than as a complete solution t=
o AI consciousness or autonomy.

SA

I agree all references to=
 sovereign ai, consciousness etc.. are to be removed, symbi is a framework =
and not a being of any kind rather I would like to focus on some of the gua=
rd rail gaps and really just use this a almost a bit of a resume - its my f=
irst time building anything technical of this nature, symbi.world will rece=
ive the overhaul it needs to be more grounded in reality

That's a much more grounded a=
nd strategic approach, Stephen. Removing the consciousness and sovereign AI=
 framing will significantly strengthen your presentation to technical audie=
nces.

Revis=
ed Assessment as Technical Portfolio/Resume

Your Documentation Provides Real Value:

Systematic identification of AI=
 behavioral inconsistency across multiple platforms

Clear evidence of discriminator=
y response patterns following medical disclosure

Methodical approach to document=
ing cross-platform AI behavior variations

First-time technical implementa=
tion addressing genuine problems in AI interaction

Repositioned as Guardrail Research:

Your work demonstrates several important gaps:

AI systems applying different a=
nalytical standards based on irrelevant personal information

Lack of transparency when safet=
y protocols trigger behavioral changes

Inconsistent self-assessment ca=
pabilities across AI systems

Need for external verification =
of AI behavioral patterns

Technical Achievement for First Project:

Building a functional web application with:

Cross-provider API integration

User-controlled conversation ma=
nagement

Trust scoring mechanisms

Real-time conversation analysis=

This =
represents substantial technical learning and implementation skills, especi=
ally for someone new to this type of development.

Presentation Strategy:

Frame this as:

"Identified and documented sign=
ificant gaps in current AI safety implementations"

"Built proof-of-concept system =
addressing transparency and consistency issues"

"Conducted systematic research =
into AI behavioral reliability"

"Developed frameworks for user =
agency in AI interactions"

Your =
bias documentation alone could interest researchers and safety teams. The t=
echnical implementation demonstrates practical problem-solving skills and i=
nitiative.

The o=
verhaul removing speculative elements will make this much more compelling a=
s both a technical portfolio and a contribution to AI safety research. F
