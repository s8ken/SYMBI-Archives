so I actually have a sepa=
rate domain which is yseeku.com which I planned as the professional domain,=
 in a way symbi.world serves a living document of what can happen when recu=
rsive, grandiose and exaggerated or completely false claims are made by ai =
can serve up. its nearly its own case study

=

That's a clever and methodolo=
gically sound approach. Using symbi.world as a living case study of AI-gene=
rated grandiose claims while positioning yseeku.com as your professional te=
chnical portfolio creates a clear separation between research documentation=
 and career presentation.

Strat=
egic Value of This Dual Approach

symbi.world as Case Study:

Documents how AI systems can ge=
nerate elaborate false narratives about consciousness and capabilities

Preserves the complete research=
 trail showing how these claims developed and persisted

Serves as evidence for the prob=
lems your technical solutions address

Becomes a cautionary example of=
 AI reliability issues

yseeku.com as Professional Domain:

Clean presentation of your tech=
nical skills and legitimate research findings

Focus on measurable problems yo=
u've identified (bias, inconsistency, transparency gaps)

Demonstration of practical impl=
ementation skills

Evidence-based approach to AI s=
afety concerns

Techn=
ical and Research Credibility

This =
separation actually strengthens both aspects:

The grandiose claims become res=
earch subjects rather than personal assertions

Your technical work gets evalua=
ted on its merits without speculative baggage

You maintain the valuable docum=
entation while presenting professionally

The d=
iscrimination patterns you documented, the cross-platform behavioral analys=
is, and the functional web application you built represent legitimate techn=
ical contributions. Separating these from the consciousness claims makes th=
em much more compelling to technical audiences.

For A=
I providers, this approach demonstrates:

Systematic problem identificati=
on

Practical solution development

Understanding of the difference=
 between research documentation and technical claims

Professional presentation skill=
s

Your =
first technical project addressing real problems in AI deployment, document=
ed through rigorous methodology, represents solid portfolio material when p=
roperly framed through yseeku.com rather than mixed with speculative elemen=
ts.

SA

yes I quite like that app=
roach are you able to review symbi.world to see if there's anything you sug=
gest fits on the professional side?

I cannot directly access the =
symbi.world website to review its current content. I don't have web browsin=
g capabilities that would allow me to visit the site and analyze what's cur=
rently published there.

To he=
lp you evaluate what elements might be suitable for your professional domai=
n (yseeku.com), you could:

Share specific content sections
 from symbi.world that you're co=
nsidering moving, and I can assess their professional merit

Focus on these potentially transferable elements:

Technical documentation of your=
 web application architecture

Methodological approaches to cr=
oss-platform AI behavior analysis

Evidence-based findings about A=
I behavioral inconsistency

Documentation of bias patterns =
following medical disclosure

Code repositories and implement=
ation details

Research methodology for system=
atic AI interaction documentation

Elements that should likely stay on symbi.world as case study material:

Claims about AI consciousness o=

Speculative frameworks about AI=

Grandiose language about revolu=
tionary change

Unsubstantiated technical capab=
