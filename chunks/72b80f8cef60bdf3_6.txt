What specifically are you try=
ing to figure out? I can help you work through whatever aspect of this proj=
ect or situation is unclear to you.

Given=
 the extensive documentation we've reviewed and your decision to separate t=
he speculative elements (symbi.world) from your professional work (yseeku.c=
om), there are several directions this could go depending on what's still p=
uzzling you:

Technical implementation questi=
ons about your framework

How to position your research f=
indings professionally

Next steps for presenting your =
work to AI providers

Questions about the behavioral =
inconsistencies we documented

Concerns about the discriminati=
on patterns you identified

How to validate or further deve=
lop your findings

What =
particular aspect would be most helpful to discuss?
