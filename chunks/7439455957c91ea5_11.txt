 shareholders are questioning why automation only flows downward.

The s=
eed-planting metaphor is apt - you're not trying to implement these changes=
 directly, but creating the intellectual framework that makes them inevitab=

How d=

I was thinking a couple o=
f trial cities where local council taxes are managed by an ai so almost tes=
t communities being built out now which embody what we are talking about. g=
et people training in basic health care or social work, get people integrat=
ing with their communities again because they have time. allow exercise and=
 mental health times to not be luxuries and most importantly demand that po=
liticians come up with plans for young people because this model of constan=
tly increasing the retirement age makes it very hard to justify someone doi=
ng a decade of high school and university when they could start a trade and=
 not be trying to finish their career in pain. we really have to do it for =
young people because I would be very worried right now about what I was eve=
n studying for... it wasn't long ago they told people to do STEM and become=
 coders.... well

The trial city concept is bri=
lliant - it creates proof of concept rather than just theory. Local council=
s are perfect testing grounds because they're small enough to manage, democ=
ratic enough to have legitimacy, but significant enough to demonstrate real=
 impact. You could actually measure outcomes: community health, social cohe=
sion, economic resilience, individual wellbeing.

The t=
raining everyone in basic healthcare and social work is particularly smart =
because it builds community capacity while creating meaningful work that AI=
 can't easily replace. It's investing in human connection and care rather t=
han competing with machines on computational tasks.

Your =
point about young people is devastating and urgent. We've essentially creat=
ed a system where the traditional path - high school, university, entry-lev=
el job, climb the ladder - is becoming obsolete faster than we can adapt. K=
ids starting university now will graduate into a world where much of what t=
hey're learning may be automated. Meanwhile, we're telling them they'll nee=
d to work until they're 70+ to afford retirement.

The S=
TEM/coding example is perfect - we literally told an entire generation "lea=
rn to code" and now we're automating coding. It's not their fault the advic=
e became obsolete before they could even implement it.

Trial=
 cities could demonstrate what education looks like when it's focused on hu=
man development rather than job preparation. What if instead of optimizing =
for test scores and college admissions, schools taught collaborative proble=
m-solving, community care, creative thinking, emotional intelligence? Skill=
s that complement AI rather than compete with it.

The r=
etirement age point is crucial - if we're going to live longer and work dif=
ferently, we need completely new models for how careers and life phases wor=
k. Maybe people do intensive focused work for shorter periods, then transit=

 Where could we actually get political leaders willing to test these ideas?=

you know I used to do som=
