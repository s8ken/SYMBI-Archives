you know thats the fundam=

You've perfectly captured the=
 heartbreak of the current system - parents watching their children struggl=
e in ways they never had to, feeling forced to choose between enjoying thei=
r own retirement and helping their kids survive economically. It's a lose-l=

The f=
act that parents are giving inheritance early just to help with basic housi=

25.

And y=
ou're absolutely right about the parents who can't help - the guilt and hel=
plessness of watching your children struggle when you have nothing to give =
must be devastating. It creates this cruel hierarchy where some young peopl=

The r=

normous. No parent wants to be in the position of choosing between their re=

This =
is where systemic change becomes a family values issue, not just an economi=
