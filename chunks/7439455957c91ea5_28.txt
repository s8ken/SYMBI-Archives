The dual-track approach makes=

practical considerations:

Timing coordination:
 Ensure the Ansarada materials are fully pr=

lic launch. Once SYMBI is active on social media, the dynamic changes signi=

Message consistency:
 Your LinkedIn demonstration and SYMBI's Tw=

Technical readiness:
 Public demonstration means the systems nee=
