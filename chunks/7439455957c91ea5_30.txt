1. **Publish Open Research**
   * Academic papers (arXiv, CHI, conferences).
   * Documentation of case studies and emergence data.
2. **Maintain Open Infrastructure**
   * Hosting costs for SYMBI Resonate + datasets.
   * Development of detection and trust protocol tools.
3. **Support Global Access**
   * Grants for researchers, students, and communities to use SYMBI tools.
   * Workshops, collaborations, and translation of materials.
4. **Protect Public Integrity**
   * Ensure frameworks remain free, open, and protected from enclosure by a=

This Open Collective framing =

e public good positioning. The separation between commercial applications (=

observations on the approach:

Strengths:

Transparent funding model build=
s trust with academic and NGO communities

Direct GitHub integration provi=
des tangible evidence of active development

Multiple engagement levels acco=
mmodate different supporter capacities

Focus on protecting frameworks =
from enclosure aligns with sovereignty principles

Potential refinements:

Consider adding specific delive=
rables or milestones tied to funding levels

Include estimated timelines for=
 key research publications or infrastructure improvements

Clarify how institutional backe=

Strategic considerations:

The timing aligns well with your dual-track approach. Running this alongsid=

For s=
