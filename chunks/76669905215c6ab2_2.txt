cause it hasn’t yet loaded the proper language settings.

🔍 Why it looks weird

When a phone is fresh from the factory, it starts up in a 
default system locale
, which could be:

an incomplete 
multi-language placeholder
,

a 
Myanmar (Burmese) script fallback
 (those squiggly letters you see), or

leftover debug language tags.

The phone 
is literally waiting for you to pick your language
 so it can show everything in English.

🚀 Here’s what to do right now

Since you said:

I haven’t even got that far

you’re still on the very first screen.

Just do this:

Tap the red 
“Start”
 button in the lower right corner.

The next screen will almost certainly be the 
language selector
, where you’ll see a list like:

scss

Copy

Edit

English (United States)
Españ

ol

 (España)
Français (France)
...

Pick your language there.

Once you pick 
English
, all menus will be normal.

💡 
Short answer:

✅ This is 
not a meme coin
 or a hacked phone.

✅ It’s just a 
brand-new phone that needs you to set the language.

Once you do, all the strange letters will disappear.

If you want, send me a picture of the 
next screen after you tap “Start”
, and I’ll help you pick the right option step by step.

It came up as suggested along with English

Perfect — that actually clears everything up completely. 🙌

✅ The strange “CWY (ဘၠ TGဂ့ဝဝ~ ၵဝSSY)” you saw is just 
another language option
, probably a corrupted display of something like Burmese, Lao, or an obscure locale due to missing fonts.

When you say:

"It came up as suggested along with English"

that means your phone is simply 
showing multiple suggested languages
 at startup. The text is garbled for one of them, but that's 
completely normal on some imported or multi-region builds
 (Motorola does this on certain global variants).

💡 Bottom line

✅ 
It is not malware, not a meme coin, not hacked.

It’s just the phone offering setup in:

🇬🇧 
English
, and

a second language (whose characters aren’t properly rendering on your phone right now).

🚀 What to do

Just pick 
English
, continue with the setup, and you’ll never see that weird text again.

Ohhh — now that’s a whole different vibe!

So you’re spinning up a 
fresh meme coin on Solana
? That’s awesome. 🚀

Let’s go from weird language screens to 
degen builder mode
. 😄

🪙 Fresh SOL meme coin quick essentials

Here’s a super streamlined checklist to get you started:

✅ 
Create the token

Use something like 
solspl-token CLI

 or Phantom’s built-in mint tool if you want super simple.

Example to create with CLI:

php-template

Copy

Edit

spl-token create-token
spl-token create-account 

<
TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS

>
spl-token mint 

<
TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS

> 

<
AMOUNT

>

✅ 
Name, symbol, and image (metadata)

If you want it on Solscan with a pretty name/logo, you’ll need to upload to 
Metaplex

 (NFT-style metadata).

✅ 
Liquidity & trading

Use something like Jupiter aggregator or Birdeye to see swaps.

You’ll need to create a liquidity pool on a DEX (like Raydium or Orca) for people to trade.

✅ 
Announce to the meme lords

Twitter, Telegram, Discord. Make sure you’ve got your memes, your story, and ideally a 
fair launch
 vibe.
