to 
burn LP ownership
 or renounce mint authority to show you’re not a rug.

Make sure people see the contract verified on Solscan.

Be transparent with supply, taxes (or no taxes), liquidity lock.

LET’S GO — $HAUSPARTY 🚀

I love it already. That’s pure meme coin gold. 🎉

🎉 Quick brainstorm: the vibe of $HAUSPARTY

💃 
Name:

$HAUSPARTY — “Where we turn bear markets into dance floors.”

🎈 
Tagline ideas:

Not financial advice. Just financial dancing.

Who needs liquidity when you’ve got tequila?

The only utility is vibes.

🪩 
Lore snippet:

In a world full of charts and red candles, one token decided it was time to stop coping and start raving.

$HAUSPARTY isn’t here to go to the moon — it’s here to throw a moon party so loud the moon shows up on its own.

First tweet thread:

1️⃣ 
What’s $HAUSPARTY?

A Solana token born out of boredom and bad decisions. Perfect.

2️⃣ 
Tokenomics?

None. Because math is hard.

(but seriously: supply: 1,000,000, no taxes, liquidity locked, mint authority burnt)

3️⃣ 
Roadmap?

50% memes

30% chaos

20% hangovers

4️⃣ 
Why buy?

So you can say “I was there before it all went to zero.” Legendary.

🔥 Next steps

✅ Have your 
mint address
 yet?

If yes, drop it here and I’ll help you write a snappy shill post + check it on Solscan.

If not, I can give you 
exact commands
 or even a 
copy-paste script
 to mint your token.

So I think I am going to use that pump.fun

🤑 
Yesss — pump.fun is PERFECT for $HAUSPARTY
 🚀

That’s honestly the 
best choice right now for a meme token on Solana
, especially if you want:

✅ instant liquidity,

✅ easy fair launch (no pre-mint or wallet games),

✅ and the degens are already there waiting to ape.

🎯 What to expect with pump.fun

🚀 
pump.fun
 is basically:

A dead-simple launchpad for Solana meme coins.

You pick a name & ticker (like 
$HAUSPARTY
), upload a logo, pay ~0.02 SOL and you’re live.

It auto-creates the liquidity pool, burns the mint authority, and starts the bonding curve.

⚠️ 
So no one (including you) can rug.
 The contract is fully public + locked. The price moves up as people buy, down as they sell.
