me for 
“sending it hard in a direction”
).

“moonshot”
 = a project that could 1000x — or go to zero. Total gamble, high risk, high reward.

🚀 If you’re thinking about 
launching multiple meme coins:

🎯 
$VECTOR

Meme it as 
“the velocity of your bag”
.

Could theme it around 
speed, graphs, or acceleration memes
.

🌕 
$MOONSHOT

The classic.

Meme it around 
rockets, hopium tanks, “wen lambo” vibes
.

🧰 If you’re thinking about 
tools or platforms:

There are actually sites popping up called things like:

Moonshot bots
 on Telegram: that let you snipe new Solana tokens.

Vector analytics
: Some people use this term for tools that show “vector strength” of buys vs sells on a token. (Not standardized.)

But since you’re building $HAUSPARTY on 
pump.fun
, it’s simpler — you don't need anything fancy.

🪩 Here’s how to structure it if you want a 
mini ecosystem
:

perl

Copy

Edit

$HAUSPARTY 🪩 — the main token, memes + parties + live streams
$VECTOR 🚀 — the velocity of 

our

 community (maybe 

tied

 to DAO votes 

or

 side stunts)
$MOONSHOT 🌕 — pure gamble, let’s see 

if

 it hits 

100

x

or

 burns to zero, memes only

You can literally launch all of these on pump.fun — each with a tiny bit of SOL — and watch which one takes off. Let the memes compete. 😄

✅ TL;DR

VECTOR & MOONSHOT
 are perfect meme coin ideas if you want to expand.

You can drop them all on pump.fun, keep them micro cap, and let the community pick their favorite.

Or just keep them as 
inside jokes
 for $HAUSPARTY — like, “our vector is pumping, this is a real moonshot.”
