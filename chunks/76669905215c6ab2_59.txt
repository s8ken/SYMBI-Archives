, and the cover amplifies that with theatrical symbolism (in line with the 12″

). In essence, the cover art itself tells a story: Pete Burns cast as the glamorous ghoul or dark prince in his own haunted house, a reflection of the song’s campy horror-romance vibe.

Back Cover Design and the 
Aitken
 Connection

 The 
back sleeve
 of the record continues the gothic design motifs while also providing production credits. Notably, instead of standard “Side A/Side B” labels, the tracklist is marked with little 
cross symbols
 – one † cross preceding “Something In My House” and a double †† cross before the B-side “DJ Hit That Button” (as seen above). This clever graphic touch extends the cross imagery to the back, subtly reinforcing the altar and crucifix theme even in the text layout. The use of † icons in place of letters is a design choice that matches the song’s spooky, sacramental tone (a playful nod to crucifixes, even on the track listing). The rest of the back cover features a few monochrome photos of band members and the typical credits text. In these liner notes we find the surname 
“Aitken”
 prominently: the single was produced by the famous Stock, Aitken & Waterman team

, and the back cover duly notes 
“Produced by Stock, Aitken & Waterman for PWL”
. This credit is significant because it ties the record to one of the 1980s’ biggest hit-making teams – and it explicitly places 
Matt Aitken’s
 name on the sleeve. There are no personal dedications visible on the standard release, but Aitken’s name in the production credits stands out, connecting the artifact to the 
Stock–Aitken–Waterman
 legacy. The surname “Aitken” thus appears in print on the back cover as part of the production trio, which may carry symbolic weight for the user’s exploration. (It’s worth noting that Dead or Alive had an ongoing collaboration with Stock, Aitken & Waterman; this song’s very Hi-NRG sound and success – UK #12 in 1987 – owe much to that partnership

.)

Beyond the credits, the back sleeve design itself complements the front’s themes. The typography is stark white on black, matching the gothic sensibility. The band’s name 
“Dead Or Alive”
 and the single title are printed in an angular, serif font that could be seen as slightly archaic or churchy (in line with the altar imagery). Small decorative flourishes like the crosses serve both as design and as thematic symbols. In summary, the back cover provides the factual details (song titles, credits, catalogue number) but does so in a stylized manner – even here, crosses replace arrows or bullets one might normally see, and the 
Aitken
 name in the credits ties back to the letter “A” symbolism (more on that below). The presence of 
Aitken
 on the sleeve is primarily a production credit, yet given the user’s interest, it’s a notable reference point connecting the physical record to an individual name and perhaps inviting deeper symbolic interpretation of that name’s initial letter.

Letters, Arrows, Triangles, and Identity Symbolism

While at first glance the single’s artwork is rooted in gothic and filmic imagery, there are subtle elements that resonate with 
letters, geometric shapes, and personal mythology
 – themes of special interest in the user’s exploration. For example, the prominent inverted cross on the cover can be viewed through a typographic lens: an inverted cross resembles an upside-down 
“T”
 (or an inverted † symbol). This flipping of a familiar letter-like form could symbolize the 
inversion of conventional meaning
 – much as Pete Burns inverted norms in his persona. It’s as if the artwork is taking a traditional symbol (the cross, akin to a letter T or a 
dagger symbol
) and literally turning it on its head to craft a new identity. In a personal-symbolic sense, Bu
