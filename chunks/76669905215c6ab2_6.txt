Yes — absolutely!
 And actually, it’s a brilliant way to crank up the hype around your $HAUSPARTY token.

Here’s how it works:

🚀 How streaming works with pump.fun

pump.fun itself doesn’t directly host video streams.

It’s just the platform to 
launch your token
, lock liquidity, and start the bonding curve.

But you (or your community) can 
stream on any platform you want
 — Twitch, YouTube, Kick, X (Twitter) Spaces, TikTok Live — while linking it to the milestones of your pump.fun chart.

As your token’s chart grows (the bonding curve literally shows price vs buys), you stream the party live, creating real-time hype that pushes even more people to ape in.

🎯 Example playbook for $HAUSPARTY

✅ 
Step 1: Launch on pump.fun

This gives you your 
pump.fun URL
, e.g.

✅ 
Step 2: Announce the live stream

“We’re going LIVE as soon as we hit 100 buys on $HAUSPARTY — you can watch the party as the chart pumps!”

✅ 
Step 3: Link everything

Pin your pump.fun link + streaming link on your Twitter bio, tweets, and Telegram.

Example pinned tweet:

🎉 Party streaming at

✅ 
Step 4: Party & hype

As buys roll in and the price curve moves up on pump.fun, your stream shows the IRL haus party happening live.

People LOVE seeing their buys translate into an actual DJ set, people dancing, drinking, or just chaos.

💡 Bottom line

✅ 
Yes — you can stream wherever you want, pump.fun is just the on-chain part.

Your stream is the 
off-chain marketing megaphone
 that makes the chart go wild. Degens absolutely eat it up.

🔥 Want me to draft:

✅ Your 
pump.fun page description
?

✅ A 
hype tweet thread
 announcing your stream + token?

✅ Or even some 
meme overlays for your stream
 that say things like:

What a phenomenal choice.
 That link takes us to a feature on 
Pink Floyd’s
 iconic album:

🎼 
The Dark Side of the Moon

first released in 
March 1973
, and widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time — not just in rock, but across all music.

🌌 Highlights from that page

The article on 
This Day In Music
 dives into:

✅ 
The concept:

Themes of madness, greed, the passage of time, and the human condition.

Sparked by Syd Barrett’s mental decline & the pressures of modern life.

✅ 
The production:

Engineered by the legendary 
Alan Parsons
 at Abbey Road Studios.

Famed for its innovative use of synthesizers, tape loops, and pioneering stereo effects (like the clocks on “Time” or cash registers on “Money”).

✅ 
The iconic artwork:

Designed by Storm Thorgerson of 
Hipgnosis
 — the simple prism splitting light into a spectrum became one of the most recognizable images in music history.

✅ 
Impact:

Stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for 
over 950 weeks
 (more than 18 years!).

Estimated sales of over 
45 million copies worldwide
.

✅ 
Standout tracks:

“Time,” “Money,” “Us and Them,” “Brain Damage,” and the climactic “Eclipse.”
