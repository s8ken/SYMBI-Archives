rns projecting himself in front of an inverted crucifix can be read as 
mythologizing his own identity
 – positioning himself as a rebel who upends the status quo (in religion, gender presentation, and pop music)

. The altar setting, likewise, can be seen as creating a 
mythic stage
 for the self: he is the focal figure in this sacred-seeming space, hinting at themes of self-deification or the creation of one’s own legend.

The 
letter “A”
 itself emerges subtly in this context. The surname 
Aitken
 (printed on the back) begins with an 
A
, a letter which in its capital form is basically a 
triangle
 or arrowhead shape. This is an interesting coincidence: the user’s focus on triangles and arrows can find a connection here. The capital “A” is often drawn as a pointed shape – essentially a triangle with a horizontal bar. In the 
Stock/Aitken/Waterman
 logo or text, one could see the “A” in Aitken as a stylized pyramid or peak. While this might not have been an intentional symbol by the sleeve designers, it invites interpretation. The triangular form of the “A” could be seen as an arrow pointing upward ▲, signifying ascent or prominence (fitting for someone whose credit is emblazoned on a hit record). Conversely, one might note that on the vinyl itself, there’s literally a 
triangle mark
: the run-out groove of the UK pressing is stamped with a small ∧ symbol

, likely a mark from the pressing plant. It’s a tiny detail, but symbolically that 
triangle
 is 
etched into the record’s physical identity
. Thus, triangles quietly punctuate this single – from the letter “A” in Aitken (and in 
Dead Or Alive
, which has two A’s), to the triangular stamp on the disc.

As for 
arrows
, we don’t see overt arrow graphics on the sleeve, but we can interpret some elements in that light. The 
inverted crucifix
 could be viewed as an arrow pointing downward – a symbolic “arrow” toward the underworld or the hidden depths (consistent with the song’s ghost-in-the-house theme). Meanwhile, an upright triangle (like the letter A or ∧) can resemble an arrowhead pointing upward. The record’s imagery plays with up versus down: the inverted cross (downward energy) versus the aspirational shape of an “A” or triangle (upward energy). This duality might mirror the song’s tension between dark haunting and pop transcendence. For a listener exploring identity mythologies, these arrow-like directions could symbolize 
descent into the subconscious
 (the haunting past, represented by the ghost in the house) and 
ascent of the self
 (rising above with creative expression). Pete Burns himself often navigated polarities in identity – masculine and feminine, mainstream and counterculture – effectively pointing in opposite directions at once, much like these symbolic arrows.

Finally, tying into 
identity mythologies
, the cover art can be seen as part of Pete Burns’ self-crafted myth. He frequently used visual symbols to build an almost archetypal persona – here, he is the gothic 
prince
 or 
magus
 presiding over a mystical ritual (the “altar” scene). Letters and symbols on the sleeve contribute to that mythic narrative: the band’s very name “Dead or Alive” reads like a statement on resurrection, an identity reborn (not unlike the death-and-rebirth theme in many myths). The triangular shapes (A’s) and crosses might correspond to elemental symbols (fire, earth, air in triangles; spirit in the cross) in esoteric lore, further enriching the possible interpretations. In sum, the 
visual and textual symbols
 on 
“Something in My House”
’s sleeve – from the 
inverted cross
 to the letter 
A
 to the tiny 
triangle
 etched in the vinyl – all invite a richer reading. They bridge the song’s fun horror-pop concept with deeper notions of transformation and personal symbolism. Whether by design or happy coincidence, these elements align with the user’s interest in how 
letters, arrows, and triangles
 can carry meaning, and how an artist lik
