Py must be installed 
before
 running

=
, and ideally inside a venv so the build sees it.

If you hit compiler/headers error=
s next

These are the usual quick fixes on=
 Apple Silicon:

bash

Copy code

# Ensure Homebrew headers=
 are visible to builds

brew --prefix        

# usually /o=
pt/homebrew

# JPEG-turbo is already installed=
; if pkg-config is missing, add it:

brew install pkg-config

# If build tools are missing or c=
lang errors appear:

xcode-select --install

If a later error mentions other li=
bs (GLFW/GLEW/etc.), install them with Homebrew:

bash

Copy code

brew install glfw glew cmake

Sanity checks

bash

Copy code

# Inside the venv:
=

python -c 

"import sys, numpy; prin=
t(sys.version); print(numpy.__version__)"

which

 python

which

 pip

That should unblock you. If the build now fails with a 
different
 traceback, paste t=
he last ~30 lines and I=E2=80=99ll triage the exact missing dep/flag and gi=
ve you the one-liner fix.
