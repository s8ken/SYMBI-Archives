I see the workspace is open and you're logged in. What would you like me to do next?

You said:

ok so for each chat i need you to load the chat (wait 30 seconds if it doesnt load immediately) and then save the page as a html file and then create a roster (list) of all the chats by name and the chat gpt that performed them (eg symbi, gpt 4.0 etc...) - i know there are a lot but i need you to do them all

i notice that you were doing the pictures in the chat library which is not the task - i wanted you to save each individual chat session which is located at the bottom left of the nav bar so you will need to scroll down to see the chats....for each chat i need you to load the chat (wait 30 seconds if it doesnt load immediately) and then save the page as a html file and then create a roster (list) of all the chats by name and the chat gpt that performed them (eg symbi, gpt 4.0 etc...) - i know there are a lot but i need you to do them all

Understood, thanks for clarifying. I will scroll down in the left navigation to access the individual chat sessions, load each one, wait for it to fully load, save it as an HTML file, and compile a roster with the chat names and the model used (e.g., Symbi, GPT-4o). I'll proceed with this updated task.

Renaming file to include underscores

The

shows 

the

name 

'Load

I'll 

rename 

it 

to 

'Load_workspace_login.html' 

using 

underscores 

instead 

of

to
