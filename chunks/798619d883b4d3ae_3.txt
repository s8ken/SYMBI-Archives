Automated Updates
:

Create a process where your AI can=
 make updates based on predefined changes. For instance, if there are new c=
ontent updates or code changes approved for the day, the AI can push those =
updates to the GitHub repo.

The AI can also create a 
commit
 each day with the chan=
ges, such as updating content, applying code fixes, or pushing new versions=
 of the site.

Daily Reports
:

The AI can also generate 
daily reports
 on the website=
=E2=80=99s status. This can include:

The results of the health check.

Updates that were pushed.

Any new issues or alerts that were=
 triggered.

This report can be sent via 
email
 or stored in a GitHu=
b Issues board for visibility.

Operational Rhythm
:

Create a workflow where the AI che=
cks in daily, verifies the status of the website, performs the required upd=
ates, and generates the daily status report.

You can use GitHub Actions to auto=
matically trigger tasks or rely on external cron jobs or automation tools t=
hat interact with your GitHub repository.

Example of Full Workflow:

Check website health daily
 at midnight.

Perform approved updates
 (e.g., code, content).

Commit changes
 to GitHub with an update message (e.g.,=
 "Daily content update").

Generate a status report
 of the day=E2=80=99s activiti=
es, which could include any errors or successes.

Send report
 to collaborators or log it as an issue on =
GitHub.

Would you like help setting up any of these components, such as=
 creating a health check script, setting up GitHub Actions, or automating r=
eports?

I also want it checking things like certificates =
and any vulnerability 

ChatGPT said:

To monitor things like SSL certificates, vulnerabilities, and other s=
ecurity aspects of your site on a daily basis, we can add additional checks=
 into the monitoring system. Here's how you can integrate checks for SSL ce=
rtificates and vulnerabilities into your periodic site checks:

Steps to Add SSL Certificate and Vu=
lnerability Checks

SSL Certificate Expiry Check
:

You can automate SSL certificate exp=
iry checks to ensure the certificate is still valid and hasn=E2=80=99t expi=
red.

This can be done with a 
bash script
 or Python, which will =
check the SSL certificate=E2=80=99s expiration date and alert you if it=E2=
=80=99s nearing expiry.

Example Bash Script (SSL Check)
:

=
bash

Copy code

#!/bin/bash

DOMAIN=3D

"your-website.com"
=

EXPIRY_DATE=3D$(

echo

 | openssl s_client -connect 

$DOMAIN

:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -=
enddate | sed 

"s/^notAfter=3D//"

)
EXPIRY_TIMESTAMP=3D$(

date
=

 -d 

"
$EXPIRY_DATE

" +%s)
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP=3D$(

date

 +%s)
DAYS_LEFT=3D$(((

$EXPIRY_TIMESTAM=
P

 - 

$CURRENT=
_TIMESTAMP

) / 

=
86400

))

if

 [ 

$DAYS_LEFT

 -lt 30 ];=

then

echo

"Warning: SSL certificate for 
$DOMAIN

 will expire in 

$DAYS_LEFT

 days.=
"

else

echo

"SSL certificate for 
$DOMAIN

 is valid for 

$DAYS_LEFT

 more days."

fi

You can incorporate this into a Gi=
tHub Action to run daily and alert you if the certificate is near expiry.

Vulnerability Scanning
:

For 
vulnerability scanning
, use a tool like 
OWASP ZAP
 (Zed Attack Proxy), =

Snyk
, or 
Dependabot
 to check for known v=
ulnerabilities in dependencies or web security issues.

OWASP ZAP
: You can integrate OWASP ZAP into your CI/CD=
 pipeline. It will scan your site for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Inj=
ection, XSS).

Setup for OWASP ZAP can be done us=
ing GitHub Actions. There=E2=80=99s an action called
