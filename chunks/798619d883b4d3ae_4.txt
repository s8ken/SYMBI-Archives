This action will run ZAP against y=
our website and produce a report of potential vulnerabilities.

Dependency Vulnerability Check (Using Snyk or Dependabot)
:

Dependabot
 is built into GitHub and can automatically =
scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It will raise pull reques=
ts to update vulnerable dependencies.

Snyk
 is another tool that can scan your dependencies a=
nd alert you to vulnerabilities in open-source libraries.

You can set up 
Snyk
 within your GitHub Actions to mon=
itor your dependencies:

Automated Alerts and Reports
:

Once vulnerabilities or SSL certif=
icate issues are detected, you=E2=80=99ll want your AI to generate a report=
 and send notifications (either through email or GitHub issues).

For SSL checks, you can simply log=
 the expiration status into a file and alert the team.

For vulnerability reports, either =
the 
OWASP ZAP
 or 
Snyk
 actions will gener=
ate detailed reports that you can send to your team.

Example Full Monitoring Workflow:=

Health Check
: Verify website is up and running.

SSL Certificate Check
: Verify certificate is valid.

Vulnerability Scan
:

Use OWASP ZAP for web vulnerabilit=
ies.

Use Dependabot/Snyk to check for d=
ependency vulnerabilities.

Daily Reports
: Compile results from all checks (e.g., =
SSL status, vulnerabilities) and generate a report. Store it as a GitHub is=
sue or send it to a Slack/Email channel.
