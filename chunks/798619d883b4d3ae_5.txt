Thanks for the clarification! Since you're =
using Vercel for production deployment and GitHub mainly as a repository ba=
ckup, it sounds like you want a simple, low-code solution for monitoring yo=
ur site, checking SSL certificates, and scanning for vulnerabilities withou=
t diving too deep into custom code.

Here=E2=80=99s how we can simplify =
things using low-code or no-code tools:

1. 
Website Monitoring with UptimeRobot (or similar)

UptimeRobot
 is a great tool for monitoring website uptime=
 and SSL certificate status. You can set it to check the availability of yo=
ur website at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

It can also alert you if the SSL cer=
tificate is about to expire, or if there are any downtime issues.

How to set up:

Go to 
UptimeRobot

 and create an account.

Set up a new monitor for your websit=
e (you=E2=80=99ll need to input the URL of your site).

Choose the type of monitoring (HTTP(=
s) for your website).

Set up email or Slack notifications=
 for alerts on downtime or certificate expiry.

Advantages
:

No coding
 required.

You'll get automatic notifications=
 for downtime and certificate issues.

2. 
Vulnerability Scanning with Snyk (Low-Code Integration)

Snyk
 offers a straightforward, low-code solution for s=
canning your codebase for vulnerabilities, especially if you're using depen=
dencies (like npm packages or other libraries).

You can integrate Snyk directly wi=
th your GitHub repo or Vercel to monitor your dependencies for known vulner=
abilities.

How to Set Up:

Go to 
Snyk

, sign up, and link your GitHub repository.

Snyk will automatically scan your =
dependencies and alert you to any vulnerabilities.

You can also link it to your Verce=
l account to get notifications about any issues with your deployment.

Advantages
:

No custom coding
 needed.

Snyk will automatically monitor an=
d provide vulnerability reports.

3. 
Automating Deployment Monitoring (Vercel and GitHub Integra=
tion)

Vercel handles the deployment, so =
once your changes are pushed to GitHub, Vercel will take care of building a=
nd deploying the site.

You can configure 
Vercel=E2=80=99s GitHub integration
 =
to automatically deploy changes from the main branch. Additionally, you can=
 monitor your deployments directly from Vercel=E2=80=99s dashboard.

How to set up:

Link your GitHub repository to Ver=
cel.

Every time a change is pushed to G=
itHub (e.g., through your low-code platform or directly), Vercel will autom=
atically build and deploy it to production.

Vercel also provides insights on p=
erformance, errors, and analytics, which can help in monitoring your site=
=E2=80=99s health without writing any code.

Advantages
:

Automatic deployments
 and 
monitoring
 from the Vercel dashboard.

You can get real-time logs and per=
formance insights without needing code.

4. 
Daily Updates and Monitoring (Slack or Email Notifications)=

You can use 
Zapier
 to integrate 
UptimeRobot
 or 
Snyk
 with 
Slack
 or 
e=
mail
 for daily or on-demand reports.

For example, if UptimeRobot detect=
s an issue or Snyk finds a vulnerability, it can send a Slack message or em=
ail to alert you.

How to set up with Zapier:

Create a Zap that connects 
UptimeRobot
 or 
Snyk
 to 
Slack
 or 
email
.

Configure Zapier to send updates l=
ike:

"Your website is down!"

"Your SSL certificate will expire =
in 5 days."

"New vulnerability detected in a d=
ependency."

Advantages
:

Low-code integration
.

Get 
real-time notifications
 and keep your team informe=
d.

5. 
Vercel Logs and Performance Insights

You can monitor your website=E2=80=
=99s performance directly within 
Vercel
 using its built-in features:

View 
build logs
 to understand any deployment issues.

Use 
Vercel Analytics
 to monitor real-time performance,=
 traffic, and errors.
