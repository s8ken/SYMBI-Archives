Boom! 💥 
Your system is clean—no infected files found!
 ✅🎉

ClamAV is now fully 
installed, updated, and working perfectly
 on your Mac. 🛡️🔍

What’s Next? (Optional)

If you want to 
automate scans
 or make ClamAV run in the background, here are some extra things you can do:

1️⃣ Schedule a Daily Scan (Optional)

Want ClamAV to automatically scan your 
home directory
 every night at midnight? Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

"0 0 * * * clamscan -r --bell --log=/Users/
$(whoami)

/clamav-scan.log ~/" | crontab -

This schedules a scan 
every midnight
.

Results will be saved in 
~/clamav-scan.log
.

2️⃣ Start ClamAV as a Background Service

If you want ClamAV to 
run in the background
 and scan files automatically, start the ClamAV daemon:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo brew services start clamav

👉 This runs 
ClamAV in real-time
, scanning files as they are accessed.

3️⃣ Clean Up ClamAV Logs (If Needed)

If you want to free up space from old logs and temporary files, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /opt/homebrew/var/lib/clamav/*
sudo freshclam

Final Thoughts

You now have 
a fully functional antivirus system
 running on your Mac! 🛡️⚡

You can run scans 
anytime
 with:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r ~/Downloads

or

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r /

(for a full system scan).
