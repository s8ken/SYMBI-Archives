 out known malware, let’s check for 
hidden spyware or remote access tools
.

1️⃣ Run a System Security Audit with Lynis

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install lynis
sudo lynis audit system

👉 This will give us a 
security report
 listing 
misconfigurations, remote access risks, and vulnerabilities.

2️⃣ Scan for Hidden Startup Malware with KnockKnock

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

👉 This will 
scan for hidden launch agents
 that persist after reboots.

3️⃣ Check for Unusual Outbound Connections with LuLu

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu
open /Applications/LuLu.app

👉 LuLu will 
alert you in real-time
 if spyware is secretly sending data.

Final Step: Check for Errors & Report Findings

Run the error check command:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log | grep 

"ERROR"

📌 
Let me know what errors show up, and we’ll troubleshoot them!

Alright! Since there's 
no ClamAV log file
, it means:

ClamAV 
did not save
 the error messages to a log file.

The errors might have been 
permissions-related
 (files it couldn't scan).

Step 1: Find Out What Went Wrong

Since there's no log file, let's check what 
ClamAV failed to scan
 by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep 

"ERROR"

👉 This will 
list all error messages
 from the scan.

👉 If the output is long, you can 
save it to a file
:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep 

"ERROR"

 > ~/clamav_errors.txt

Then, check the errors using:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/clamav_errors.txt

Step 2: Common Causes of ClamAV Errors

Permission Denied:
 ClamAV may not have access to certain system files.

Locked Files:
 Some files may be in use by macOS.

Symbolic Link Issues:
 Some directories might be unreadable due to symlinks.

If you see 
"Permission Denied"
 errors, try running:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo clamscan -r /

Step 3: (Optional) Enable Logging for Future Scans

If you'd like to 
enable logging
 for next time, create the log directory and file:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

mkdir

 -p /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav
sudo 

touch

 /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log
sudo 

chmod

 644 /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log

Then, run ClamAV with logging enabled:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo clamscan -r / --

log

=/opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log

Next Steps

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep 

"ERROR"

📌 
Let me know what errors appear, and I’ll guide you through fixing them!

sja@SJAs-MacBook-Pro ~ % clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep "ERROR"

/usr/share/httpd/error/HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.html.var: OK

Ah, interesting! 
No actual errors appeared
, except for the standard 
HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.html.var
 file, which is normal and 
not a real issue
. 🚀

What This Means:

ClamAV ran successfully
 but didn’t save the errors to a log (which we can enable for next time).

The "Total Errors: 1924"
 from your scan report 
were likely just permission-denied errors
 for system-protected files.

There are no malware detections
—your system is clean from known viruses! ✅

What’s Next? (Deep Spyware & Remote Management Check)

Since 
no traditional malware was found
, but you're concerned about 
rogue camera extensions, remote management, and screen capturing
, let's dig deeper using 
security auditing tools.

1️⃣ Check for Remote Management & Spyware with Lynis

🔍 This tool will 
audit your Mac’s security
, checking for:

Remote access (SSH, VNC, Backdoors)

Weak permissions

Hidden rootkits or spyware

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew
