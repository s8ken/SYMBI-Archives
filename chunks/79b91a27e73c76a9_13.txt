Ah, I see! 
ClamAV is still running the full system scan
, and it's just printing out the files it checks. This is normal behavior. ⚡

Options:

1️⃣ 
Let it finish
 – If you want to complete the scan, just let it run until it stops.

2️⃣ 
Cancel the scan
 – If you’re satisfied that ClamAV found no threats before, you can 
stop the scan
 by pressing:

objectivec

Copy

Edit

CTRL

 + C

What’s Next?

Since 
ClamAV already found no malware
, I’d recommend moving on to:

✅ 
Lynis
 (
sudo lynis audit system
) – Security Audit

✅ 
KnockKnock
 (
brew install --cask knockknock
) – Detect Hidden Malware

✅ 
OverSight
 (
brew install --cask oversight
) – Monitor Camera/Mic

✅ 
LuLu
 (
brew install --cask lulu
) – Block Hidden Network Activity

📌 
Let me know which one you want to check first, and I'll guide you!

Alright, since 
ClamAV is still running
, it's normal to see those 
"OK" messages
—it's just showing files being scanned.

What You Can Do Now

1️⃣ 
If you want to stop the scan:

Press 

CTRL + C

 in the terminal to cancel it.

2️⃣ 
If you want to let it finish:

Just let it run; it might take 
hours
 depending on the number of files.

No Errors Found? That’s Good!

Your 
previous ClamAV scan found 0 infected files
.

No 
ERROR
 messages appeared, so
