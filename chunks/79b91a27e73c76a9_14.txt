Next Steps: Let's Hunt for Spyware & Remote Monitoring

Since ClamAV found 
no traditional viruses
, let’s check for 
hidden surveillance tools
:

1️⃣ Run a Security Audit with Lynis

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install lynis
sudo lynis audit system

👉 This will 
scan your Mac for security weaknesses
, 
remote access services
, and 
misconfigured permissions
.

2️⃣ Detect Hidden Malware with KnockKnock

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

👉 This tool will 
list all persistent startup malware
 that 
ClamAV might not detect
.

3️⃣ Monitor for Spyware Accessing Your Camera/Microphone

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask oversight
open /Applications/OverSight.app

👉 
If spyware is secretly using your mic or camera, OverSight will catch it.

4️⃣ Detect Hidden Outbound Traffic with LuLu

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu
open /Applications/LuLu.app

👉 
If any hidden malware is sending data over the internet, LuLu will warn you.

    Why do I see this error?
    -------------------------------
    This is a protection mechanism to prevent the root user from executing user created files. The files may be altered, or including malicious pieces of script.

    What can I do?
    ---------------------
    Option 1) Check if a trusted user created the files (e.g. due to using Git, Homebrew or similar).
              If you trust these files, you can decide to continue this run by pressing ENTER.

    Option 2) Change ownership of the related files (or full directory).

       Commands (full directory):
         # cd ..
         # chown -R 0:0 lynis
         # cd lynis
         # ./lynis audit system

Ah, you've encountered 
Lynis’ security check
, which is preventing execution because some files 
aren’t owned by the root user
. This is a safeguard against 
malicious script execution
.

What To Do Next?

You have 
two options
:

Option 1: Trust the Files & Continue

If you trust these files (since they came from Homebrew), simply 
press ENTER
 and let the scan continue.

Option 2: Fix Ownership (Recommended for Future Runs)

If you don’t want to see this warning again, change the ownership of the Lynis directory so it belongs to 
root
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chown

 -R 0:0 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/lynis

cd

 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/lynis
sudo ./lynis audit system

Which Option Should You Choose?

✅ 
If you want a quick scan
, just 
press ENTER
 and let it run.

✅ 
If you want to permanently fix this issue
, use 
Option 2
.

Let me know what you choose and what 
Lynis finds
! 🚀
