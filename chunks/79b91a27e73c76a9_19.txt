🔍 Lynis Security Audit Results – What Stands Out?

Your 
hardening index is 76
, which is decent but could be improved. Here’s a breakdown of 
important findings
 and what they mean. 🚀

🚨 Most Important Findings (Potential Risks)

1️⃣ Remote Logging is Enabled

🔍 Finding:

"Checking remote logging [ENABLED]"

This means that 
log data might be sent to an external server
, which could be normal (for enterprise monitoring) or 
a security risk
 if unauthorized.

✅ What to Do:

Run this to check where logs are going:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /etc/syslog.conf | grep @

👉 If you see an IP address or unknown hostname, let me know—
it could be suspicious
.
