The Evolution from TronWallet to Klever
 🔄

TronWallet Era (2018-2020)

Developed by the same team behind Klever, 
TronWallet
 was one of the leading non-custodial wallets for 
TRX
 and TRC-based tokens.

It gained millions of users but had limitations tied to the 
Tron blockchain
.

Rebranding & Expansion (2020-Present)

Seeing the need for a 
multi-chain
 and 
independent
 crypto ecosystem, the team evolved into 
Klever.io
.

The goal? 
Beyond Tron
—supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and 40+ blockchains.

They launched 
Klever Wallet, Klever Exchange, and Klever Blockchain
 to create a self-sustaining crypto universe.

Founders & Development
 🏗️👁️

Klever was founded by 
Dio Ianakiara
, a blockchain visionary who spearheaded its transition from TronWallet. The team behind it includes 
developers, engineers, and crypto strategists
 with deep roots in 
Web3, finance, and decentralized technologies
.

Where is Klever Based?
 🗺️

Klever operates as a 
global, decentralized company
, with its core team and contributors spread across 
Brazil, Europe, and other parts of the world
. It’s not tied to a single location—its existence is 
truly borderless
, just like the blockchain itself. 🌐✨

The Vision: A Self-Sovereign Blockchain Economy
 🔮🚀

The 
mission
 of Klever is to empower users with 
full control over their assets
 while offering 
fast, secure, and easy
 crypto solutions. It aims to make 
crypto mainstream
 without compromising security or decentralization.

Thus, 
Klever is more than just a wallet or blockchain—it’s a movement
