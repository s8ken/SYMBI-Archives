:

32376

This means your 
logs are being sent to 
127.0.0.1
 (your own computer) on port 
32376

.

Is This a Security Risk?

No, this is not an immediate security concern.

127.0.0.1
 (localhost) means the logs are staying 
on your own machine
, not being sent to an external server.

However, 
port 
32376
 is unusual
—it could be:

A legitimate logging service (some software does this).

A process trying to intercept logs (
spyware possibility
).

🔍 What to Do Next?

1️⃣ Check What’s Running on Port 32376

Run this command to see which process is listening on port 
32376
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :32376

👉 This will 
show the name and path of the program
 using that port.

2️⃣ If It’s Suspicious, Kill It

If the program looks 
unknown or suspicious
, kill it with:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual 
process ID
 from the 
lsof
 command).

3️⃣ (Optional) Disable Remote Logging Completely

If you don’t want 
any local logging over a network port
, remove it from 
syslog.conf
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /etc/syslog.conf

Find this line:

graphql

Copy

Edit

install.* 

@127

.

0.0

.

1

:

32376

Delete the line
, then 
save and exit
 (
CTRL + X
, 
Y
, 
Enter
).

Restart the logging service:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl stop com.apple.syslogd
sudo launchctl start com.apple.syslogd

🚀 Next Step

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :32376

📌 
Tell me what process is using the port!
 If it looks suspicious, we’ll investigate further. 🔍

Step 1 Result: No Process Found on Port 32376

✅ Your command returned 
nothing
, which means 
no active process is currently listening on port 32376
.

What This Means:

1️⃣ 
The log entry might be old
 – The system was previously sending logs to 
127.0.0.1:32376
, but whatever was using that port 
is no longer active
.

2️⃣ 
It could be an inactive or hidden service
 – Some malware can start and stop processes dynamically.

3️⃣ 
It might be from an old software installation
 – A program might have configured syslog to log to 
localhost:32376
, but it’s not actually running.

What To Do Next:

1️⃣ Check for Any References to Port 32376 in System Files

Let’s check if any 
configuration files
 are still pointing to this port:

sh

Copy

Edit

grep -r 

"32376"

 /etc /var 2>/dev/null

👉 This searches for 
any system file
 mentioning 
32376
.

2️⃣ (Optional) Remove The Logging Entry

If you don’t want logs going to 
127.0.0.1:32376
, you can 
remove the syslog entry
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /etc/syslog.conf

Find this line:

graphql
