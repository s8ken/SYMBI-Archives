✅ SUCCESS: Rogue DNS Removed! 🎉

Your 
DNS is now clean
—
113.212.173.22
 is 
gone
, and your Mac is now using 
Google’s DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
. 🚀

📌 What This Means:

Your Mac was previously using an unknown DNS (
113.212.173.22
).

This could have been set by:

✅ Your router (forcing DNS settings).

✅ A VPN or app (ProtonVPN might have overridden it).

✅ A misconfigured network setting.

Now that it's fixed, your internet traffic is no longer potentially hijacked!
 🔒

🛠 Next Steps: Make Sure It Doesn't Return

1️⃣ 
Restart your Mac
 to confirm the settings 
stick
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After rebooting, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

📌 
If 
113.212.173.22
 is gone, everything is fine!
 ✅

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

👉 This lists 
all active internet connections
 on your Mac.

📌 
If you see unknown IPs, let me know!

2️⃣ Check for Startup Malware

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

👉 
KnockKnock
 will scan your Mac for 
hidden startup malware
.

run 
netstat
