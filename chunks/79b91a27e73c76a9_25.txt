🔍 Analyzing Your Active Network Connections

You have 
several established connections
, all of which appear to be normal. Let’s break them down:

🛡️ Legitimate Connections:

1️⃣ 
Google Services:

8.8.8.8.443
 → This is 
Google DNS
 (Safe ✅)

142.250.70.164.443
 → Google-owned IP (Likely Google services ✅)

142.250.70.228.443
 → Another Google-owned IP (Likely YouTube, Gmail, or Google Drive ✅)

2️⃣ 
Apple Services:

17.253.121.202.443
 → 
Apple-owned
 (Likely iCloud, Apple services ✅)

17.57.145.41.5223
 → Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) 
(Safe ✅)

3️⃣ 
Cloudflare Services:

104.18.32.47.443

104.18.41.158.443

These IPs belong to Cloudflare
—likely web traffic protection or a VPN (Safe ✅).

4️⃣ 
185.70.42.X (ProtonVPN/ProtonMail)

185.70.42.22.443

185.70.42.43.443

Owned by ProtonVPN/ProtonMail
 (Likely Safe ✅, unless you weren’t using ProtonVPN).

🚀 Final Verdict: No Suspicious Active Connections Found! 🎉

✅ 
All detected IPs belong to trusted companies: Apple, Google, Cloudflare, ProtonVPN.

✅ 
No unknown or suspicious connections to remote servers detected.

🛠 Next Steps (Optional Security Enhancements)

If you want to 
monitor connections in real time
 or set up alerts for unknown IPs, you can:

1️⃣ 
Use LuLu Firewall
 to block unknown outbound connections:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu

LuLu
 will notify you if an unknown app tries to connect to the internet.

2️⃣ 
Run KnockKnock to scan for persistent malware:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

It checks for 
hidden malware that launches at startup.

🎯 Summary of What We’ve Accomplished:

✅ 
Removed a suspicious DNS hijack (
113.212.173.22
)

✅ 
Confirmed no malware is running from deleted files

✅ 
Checked network connections—ALL are from safe sources

🚀 
Your Mac looks clean and secure!
 If you want to go deeper, we can check for 
keyloggers, hidden screen recorders, or unauthorized remote access tools.

Let me know if you want to do 
one last deep dive or call it a mission accomplished!
