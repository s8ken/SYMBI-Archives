🔍 Final Lynis Hardening Review – What's Left to Improve?

Your 
Lynis security audit
 scored 
76
, which is good, but we can still improve your Mac's security by addressing the remaining 
warnings and suggestions
 from the scan.

📌 Remaining Lynis Hardening Recommendations

Here are the key security improvements Lynis suggested:

1️⃣ Strengthen Home Directory Permissions

🔍 Issue:

"Double check the permissions of home directories as some might be not strict enough. [HOME-9304]"

🛠 Fix:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 700 /Users/*

📌 This 
locks down all home directories
, making them accessible 
only to their owner
.

2️⃣ Protect the 
/etc/sudoers.d
 Directory

🔍 Issue:

"Permissions for directory: /etc/sudoers.d [WARNING]"

🛠 Fix:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 750 /etc/sudoers.d

📌 This prevents unauthorized users from modifying 
sudo permissions
.

3️⃣ Enable Password Strength Checking

🔍 Issue:

"Install a PAM module for password strength testing like 
pam_cracklib
 or 
pam_passwdqc
. [AUTH-9262]"

🛠 Fix:

Install 
password policy enforcement
 on macOS:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/passwd

📌 Add this line 
at the bottom
:

arduino

Copy

Edit

password requisite pam_passwdqc.so min=

12

,

8

,

8

,

7

,

6

🔒 This enforces 
stronger passwords
 on your system.

4️⃣ Check Deleted Files Still in Use

✅ 
We already checked this, and no malware was found!
 🛡️

5️⃣ Harden Compilers (Prevent Exploits)

🔍 Issue:

"Harden compilers like restricting access to root user only. [HRDN-7222]"

🛠 Fix:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 700 /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/clang

📌 This 
prevents attackers from compiling malware
 on your Mac.

6️⃣ Remove Unused or Suspicious Startup Services

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list

📌 
If you see unknown services running, let me know, and we’ll remove them!

🚀 Final Steps – What Do You Want to Fix First?

Run the commands above
 to apply security hardening.

If you want to review startup services,
 run:

sh

Copy

Edit

✅ Password Policy Hardening Applied Successfully!
 🎉

You have successfully 
added 
pam_passwdqc.so
 to enforce stronger password security
. This means:

New passwords must meet strict strength rules.

Weak passwords will be rejected.

Your system is better protected from brute-force attacks.
