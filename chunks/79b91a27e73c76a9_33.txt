“Terminal” would like to administer your computer. Administration can include modifying passwords, networking and system settings.

🛑 Why is Terminal Asking for Admin Permissions?

When 
Terminal asks for administrator privileges
, it usually means:

You're running a command that requires elevated permissions
 (like 
sudo
).

A background process
 (e.g., ClamAV, cron, or another system tool) needs access to system settings.

macOS security restrictions
 (e.g., System Integrity Protection) are triggering the prompt.

🛠 What to Do Next

1️⃣ Did This Happen After Running 
crontab -e
 or Another Command?

If so, it's 
normal
—cron jobs sometimes need admin access.

👉 Safe to Allow?

✅ If you recognize the command you just ran, 
click "OK"
 to grant Terminal access.

❌ If this request appeared 
randomly or unexpectedly
, click 
"Don't Allow"
 and let's investigate.

2️⃣ Check What’s Requesting Admin Access

Before clicking 
"OK"
, let's check 
what process is asking
.

🔹 Run this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"cron|clamav|sudo"

📌 This will list 
active system processes
 related to cron jobs, ClamAV, or any 
sudo
 command.

3️⃣ If You Didn’t Expect This Prompt

If 
this request seems suspicious
, check the 
macOS security logs
 for recent admin access attempts:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.securityd"'

 --last 5m

📌 This shows 
security-related events from the last 5 minutes
.

🚀 What to Do Based on Your Findings

✅ 
If it’s related to ClamAV, cron, or a command you just ran → Click "OK".

🛑 
If an unknown process is requesting admin access → Click "Don't Allow" and investigate further.

🚀 
Run 
ps aux
 & 
log show
, and let me know what you find!

🛑 Why Did Terminal Ask for Admin Access After 
:wq
?

Since you just 
saved and exited 
crontab -e

, macOS likely prompted you for admin permissions because:

You modified a system-level cron job.

Your current user needs elevated privileges to schedule tasks in cron.

macOS security settings (System Integrity Protection - SIP) require confirmation for modifying system services.

✅ What You Should Do

1️⃣ 
If you trust this action (which we expect because you edited the crontab), click "OK."

This will allow macOS to save and apply the cron job.

2️⃣ 
If you're unsure, check your crontab file to verify that it saved correctly:

sh

Copy

Edit

crontab -l

If you see 
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/daily_clamav_scan.sh
, everything is fine. ✅

3️⃣ 
If You Clicked "Don't Allow" & It Didn't Save

Run 
crontab -e
 again and re-add the scheduled job:

ruby

Copy

Edit

0

0

 * * * 

/usr/local

/bin/daily

_clamav_scan.sh

Save and exit again (
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
ENTER
 if using nano).

🚀 Final Check: Confirm That the Daily Scan is Scheduled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

crontab -l

📌 If the scheduled job appears, 
you’re all set!
 🎉

👉 Let me know if everything saved correctly, or if you need to troubleshoot further! 🔍🚀
