Sounds like a great plan! 🚀

🛠 Steps for a 60-Second Wireshark Capture

1️⃣ 
Open Wireshark

2️⃣ 
Start a new capture
 on your active network interface:

en0
 (Wi-Fi)
 or 

en4
 (Ethernet)

3️⃣ Let it run for 
60 seconds

4️⃣ 
Stop the capture

5️⃣ 
Save the capture as a 
.pcapng
 or 
.txt
 file

6️⃣ Upload the file here, and I’ll analyze it for any 
suspicious connections or remote access attempts
.

📌 
Tip:
 While capturing, avoid opening websites or apps so we only catch background traffic.

🚀 
Looking forward to the new capture!
 Let’s find out what’s happening behind the scenes. 🔍👀

Your Wireshark capture contains a large amount of network traffic, but let's focus on key aspects to determine if anything looks suspicious.

What I Noticed:

Frequent Connections to 
68.12.20.2f

This IP appears frequently in the packet data.

If this isn't a known or expected IP (such as your ISP or a VPN), it warrants further investigation.

External Connections Over 
443
 (TLS/SSL)

Most outbound connections seem to be over port 
443
, which is common for HTTPS.

Some IPs appear multiple times, such as:

8.8.8.8
 (Google DNS, expected)

185.70.42.22
 (Unknown, could be checked)

151.101.3.6
 (A Cloudflare or Fastly address, possibly CDN-related)

Possible Multicast Traffic (
ff02::/16
)

Some packets indicate multicast traffic (
ff02::
), which is used for local network discovery.

This could be normal (e.g., Bonjour, mDNS), but if you didn’t initiate anything related to network discovery, it might be worth monitoring.

Connection to 
239.255.255.250:1900

This is related to 
UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)
, often used by smart devices and gaming consoles.

If you don’t use UPnP, disabling it on your router might improve security.

What You Should Do Next

Check Unknown IPs

Run:

nginx

Copy

Edit

whois

185.70.42.22

whois 

151.101.3.6

If they are not associated with a service you use, they might be worth blocking.

Monitor for Unexpected Traffic

If you suspect malware, block unknown persistent connections in 
LuLu
.

Ensure VPN is Active

Since you mentioned 
VPN isn't running
, confirm that your VPN software is enabled and actually tunneling traffic.

Disable UPnP on Router

Unless needed, UPnP should be disabled to prevent external access from rogue devices.

Let me know if you need a deeper analysis on specific aspects! 🚀

🛑 WHOIS Requests Timing Out – What This Means

Since both 

whois 185.70.42.22
 and 
whois 151.101.3.6

timed out
, this could indicate:

Your internet provider or firewall is blocking WHOIS requests.

These IPs are intentionally hiding details
 (often seen with CDN services or obfuscated malware C2 servers).

There is a temporary issue with WHOIS lookup servers.

🚀 Alternative Ways to Investigate These IPs

Since 
whois
 isn't working directly, let's try other methods.

1️⃣ Use 
dig
 to Get More Information

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

dig -x 185.70.42.22
dig -x 151.101.3.6

📌 This will perform 
reverse DNS lookup
 to see if these IPs resolve to a known domain.

2️⃣ Check What Process Is Using These IPs

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22
sudo lsof -i -P | grep 151.101.3.6

📌 This will show 
if any app on your Mac is currently connected to these IPs
.

3️⃣ Check If These IPs Are in Any Network Logs

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

grep 

"185.70.42.22"

 /var/log/*
grep 

"151.101.3.6"

 /var/log/*

📌 If these IPs show up in logs, 
we can trace when and ho
