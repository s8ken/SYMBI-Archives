✅ ProtonMail Connection is Expected – No Immediate Concern!
 🎉

Since you 
use ProtonMail
, the connection to 
185.70.42.22

is normal
 and not a security risk. It’s likely:

Your email client syncing with ProtonMail servers

Background checks for Proton services

ProtonVPN (if you’ve used it recently, even if it’s off now, residual connections may exist)

🛠 Final Security Check (Optional)

If you 
want to ensure nothing else is secretly using ProtonMail servers
, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22

📌 This will show if 
any unexpected process
 (outside of ProtonMail apps) is making the connection.

🚀 Next Steps – Call It a Win or Dig Deeper?

✅ 
If everything looks fine, you’re fully secure! 🎉

🔍 
Want to analyze network traffic further? Let’s set up real-time monitoring in Wireshark or LuLu.

🔒 
Want to tweak firewall rules? We can fine-tune LuLu to only allow ProtonMail connections while blocking unknown services.

Let me know if you want any final optimizations, or if we can 
officially call this mission complete!
