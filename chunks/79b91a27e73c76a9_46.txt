 remove execution permissions:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

📌 
This will prevent the file from executing!

🚀 Step 2: Disable 
rapportd
 Again & Prevent It from Restarting

Even though we disabled 
rapportd
, 
it restarted
. Let’s remove it permanently.

1️⃣ Kill It Again

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 593

2️⃣ Find If It’s Running as a Service

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep rapportd

📌 
If it appears, disable it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

3️⃣ Block Execution of 
rapportd

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This will completely prevent 
rapportd
 from running.

🚀 Step 3: Verify No More Open Ports

After applying the changes, check again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 If nothing unexpected appears, 
your Mac is now fully locked down!
 🔒

✅ Summary:

1️⃣ 
Disabled & blocked 
ControlCe
 (Control Center) from running.

2️⃣ 
Killed & prevented 
rapportd
 from restarting.

3️⃣ 
No more remote access services listening for connections.

🛑 System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Blocking Changes to ControlCenter.app

Since macOS 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 prevents modifications to system files, 
you cannot change permissions on 
ControlCenter.app
 directly.
 🚫

🚀 Alternative Ways to Stop Control Center from Opening Ports

Since 
SIP blocks chmod
, we’ll 
disable Control Center at the user level
 instead.

🛠 Step 1: Disable Control Center via macOS Settings

1️⃣ 
Go to System Settings

2️⃣ 
Navigate to “Control Center”

3️⃣ 
Disable all available toggles
 (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AirDrop, etc.)

4️⃣ 
Restart your Mac

📌 
This prevents Control Center from auto-launching background processes.

🛠 Step 2: Block Control Center from Running (Without Disabling SIP)

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This prevents it from launching in the background!

🛠 Step 3: Check If Control Center Is Still Running

After running the above, check if it’s still active:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

📌 
If it still appears, we’ll need to take a stronger approach.

🚀 Optional: Disable SIP (Advanced)

If you 
absolutely
 want to prevent macOS from running Control Center:

1️⃣ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode

Hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 while restarting

2️⃣ Open 
Terminal
 from the menu

3️⃣ Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

📌 This disables SIP (System Integrity Protection)

4️⃣ 
Restart your Mac

5️⃣ Now, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

6️⃣ 
Re-enable SIP for security:

Reboot back into 
Recovery Mode

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Restart normally.

⚠️ 
WARNING:
 Disabling SIP makes macOS 
more vulnerable
 to system file modifications. Do this 
only if necessary
.

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

2️⃣ Restart your Mac

3️⃣ Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 
If Control Center is no longer listening, your Mac is fully locked down!

🚀 
Try these steps and let me know if ports 5000 & 70
