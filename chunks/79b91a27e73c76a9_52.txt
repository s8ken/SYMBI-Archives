ccessibility_log.txt
)
 contains system records related to 
TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control)
, which manages app permissions for things like Accessibility, Screen Recording, and Input Monitoring.

🚨 Suspicious or Notable Entries

1️⃣ System-Level Access Requests (
TCCAccessRequest
)

Multiple services 
requested Accessibility access
:

com.apple.Installer-Progress

 → Likely a macOS system process.

com.apple.bluetoothd

 → Bluetooth daemon requesting permissions.

com.apple.recoveryosd

 → Related to macOS Recovery mode.

com.apple.imklaunchagent

 → Input method service (keyboard input).

🚨 
Why This Matters?

Input monitoring services
 like 
imklaunchagent
 can be used 
by keyloggers
 or spyware.

If these services requested Accessibility permissions 
recently
, 
we should verify that nothing suspicious is running
.

🚀 Next Steps: Check & Remove Unauthorized Accessibility Access

1️⃣ List All Apps with Accessibility Permissions

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

tccutil dump Accessibility

📌 
This will show a full list of apps that have Accessibility control.

📌 Look for 
non-Apple apps
 that shouldn’t have full control (e.g., remote access tools, unknown software).

2️⃣ Manually Review & Remove Suspicious Accessibility Apps

Open 
System Settings

Go to 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Accessibility

Review all apps that have full control

If you don’t recognize an app, REMOVE IT

Click 
"-"
 to revoke its permission.

3️⃣ Remove Specific Accessibility Permissions via Terminal

If a 
suspicious app is found
, revoke its access:

sh

Copy

Edit

tccutil reset Accessibility com.[app.bundle.identifier]

📌 Replace 
[app.bundle.identifier]
 with the actual app ID from 
tccutil dump Accessibility
.

4️⃣ Check If Any Suspicious App Is Running

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i accessibility
ps aux | grep -i tcc

📌 If any 
non-Apple process
 is running and has 
Accessibility permissions
, we should investigate further.

🚀 What To Do Next

✅ 
Run 
tccutil dump Accessibility
 and manually check for suspicious apps.

✅ 
Remove any apps from Accessibility settings that you don’t recognize.

✅ 
Check if any unauthorized apps are running (
ps aux | grep accessibility
).

any apps that shouldn’t have access
, we will remove them.
