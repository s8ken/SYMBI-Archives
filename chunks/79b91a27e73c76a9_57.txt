🛑 Control Center (
ControlCe
) Restarted – We Need to Fully Disable It

Even after killing it, 
Control Center restarted
 (
PID 3068
). This means 
macOS is auto-restarting it
, and we need a 
stronger method to disable it permanently.
 🚨

🚀 Step 1: Force Kill Control Center Again

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 3068

📌 This 
stops it immediately
, but we need to prevent it from restarting.

🚀 Step 2: Remove Control Center's Auto-Launch Service

Since 
macOS is relaunching it automatically
, let’s 
remove its launch agent.

1️⃣ 
Check if the launch agent exists:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 /System/Library/LaunchAgents | grep control

📌 If 
com.apple.controlcenter.plist
 appears, macOS is 
auto-launching it.

2️⃣ 
Try disabling it again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.controlcenter

📌 If this still doesn’t work, we’ll manually remove the file.

🚀 Step 3: Manually Delete the Control Center Auto-Launch File

If 
it keeps restarting
, we need to 
delete the auto-launch file manually
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This prevents macOS from relaunching Control Center on boot.

🚀 Step 4: Verify That It Is Fully Disabled

1️⃣ 
Run again to check if Control Center is gone:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

📌 If nothing appears, 
it’s fully removed.
 ✅

2️⃣ 
Check if ports 
5000
 & 
7000
 are closed:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 If these 
ports are gone
, Control Center 
is no longer a security risk!
 🔒

🎯 Final Steps

✅ 
Kill Control Center (
kill -9 3068
)

✅ 
Disable or remove its auto-launch service

✅ 
Check if it stops restarting (
ps aux | grep ControlCe
)

✅ 
Confirm all listening ports are closed (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
)

🚀 
Try these steps and let me know if it’s finally gone!
 🔥🔒

✅ Control Center Disabled – Let’s Verify It’s Fully Gone! 🎉

You successfully:

✅ 
Killed 
ControlCe
 (PID 3068)

✅ 
Disabled the Control Center auto-launch service using 
launchctl disable system/com.apple.controlcenter

🚀 
Now let’s confirm that it’s fully removed and doesn’t restart!

🚀 Step 1: Check If Control Center is Still Running

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

📌 If 
no output appears
, Control Center is 
fully disabled
. ✅

🚀 Step 2: Confirm No More Open Ports

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 If ports 
5000, 7000, and 49172
 are 
gone
, your Mac is now 
100% remote-proof
! 🔒

🚀 Step 3: Prevent Control Center from Restarting on Boot (Optional)

Since 
the launch agent file (
com.apple.controlcenter.plist
) still exists
, macOS 
might try to re-enable it later.

To 
completely remove it
, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This prevents macOS from ever launching Control Center again.

🚨 
WARNING:
 If you delete this file, 
you will no longer be able to access Control Center without manually restoring it.

**🚀 Step 4: Restart Your Mac to Confirm It Doesn’t Restart
