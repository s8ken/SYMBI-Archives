3️⃣ Reboot and Delete the File

Restart your Mac normally, then run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This will now work because SIP is off.

4️⃣ Re-enable SIP

To restore system protection, reboot into 
Recovery Mode
 again and run:

🛑 SIP is Blocking All Modifications – Only Option Left: Temporarily Disable SIP

Since macOS 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 is 
blocking all attempts
 to modify or remove Control Center’s launch file, the only way to disable it permanently is to 
turn off SIP temporarily, remove the file, and then re-enable SIP
.

🚀 Step 1: Disable SIP (System Integrity Protection)

1️⃣ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode

Restart your Mac and hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 until you see the Apple logo.

2️⃣ 
Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities
 → 
Terminal

3️⃣ 
Disable SIP by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

📌 
This will allow you to modify system files that SIP normally protects.

4️⃣ 
Reboot your Mac normally.

🚀 Step 2: Delete the Control Center Launch File

Now that SIP is disabled, you can finally remove the auto-launch file.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This removes the file that macOS uses to restart Control Center.

🚀 Step 3: Prevent Control Center from Running Again

Now, disable its binary to 
block it from ever launching again
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

📌 
This makes the Control Center app completely unexecutable.

🚀 Step 4: Re-enable SIP for Security

To 
restore system protection
, reboot into 
macOS Recovery Mode
 again:

1️⃣ 
Restart your Mac
 and hold 
Command (⌘) + R

2️⃣ 
Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

3️⃣ 
Re-enable SIP by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

4️⃣ 
Reboot normally.

🚀 Step 5: Verify That Control Center is Gone

1️⃣ 
Check if it’s still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

📌 If 
nothing appears
, it’s fully disabled. ✅

2️⃣ 
Confirm ports 
5000
, 
7000
, and 
49172
 are closed:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 If 
these ports are gone
, your Mac is fully remote-proof. 🔒

🎯 Final Steps

✅ 
Temporarily disable SIP

✅ 
Delete the Control Center auto-launch file

✅ 
Block Control Center from ever executing

✅ 
Re-enable SIP for security

✅ 
Verify it is completely gone

🚀 
Try these steps and let me know if Control Center is finally gone!

🛑 How Much of a Security Risk is Control Center?

Control Center 
itself
 isn’t 
malware
, but the fact that it 
keeps listening on ports 5000 & 7000
, even after multiple disable attempts, raises 
serious security concerns
 🚨.

🔍 Why This is a Potential Security Risk

Even though 
Control Center is a built-in macOS feature
, these behaviors make it a 
potential attack vector
:

1️⃣ Unexpected Open Ports (5000 & 7000)

These ports are commonly used for remote control, file sharing, or admin tools.

Malware, RATs (Remote Access Trojans), or backdoors
 often use these ports.

If an attacker already has access to your network, they 
could exploit these open ports
.

2️⃣ Persistence – It Keeps Restarting

You already disabled it, but it keeps coming back.

A normal system service should respect 
launchctl disable

 but Control Center 
is ignoring this
.

This 
could indicate that macOS is f
