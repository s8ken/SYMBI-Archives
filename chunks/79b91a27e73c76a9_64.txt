📌 
If you get "Operation not permitted," SIP (System Integrity Protection) is blocking us.

🚀 Step 5: Block Control Center & 
rapportd
 from Running

If deletion doesn’t work, we 
block execution
 by making them unreadable:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This prevents these services from launching.

🚀 Step 6: (Only If All Else Fails) Disable SIP, Remove Them, and Re-enable SIP

If 
SIP (System Integrity Protection) is preventing these services from being removed
, we must 
temporarily disable SIP
.

1️⃣ Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode

Restart your Mac and hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 until you see the Apple logo.

Go to Utilities → Terminal

Disable SIP by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

Reboot normally

2️⃣ Delete Control Center & 
rapportd

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This removes the files and makes them unreadable.

3️⃣ Re-enable SIP for Security

After removing the files, 
reboot into macOS Recovery Mode again
, and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
This turns SIP back on to protect your system again.

🎯 Final Steps

✅ 
Try killing the processes & disabling them using 
launchctl bootout

✅ 
If that fails, delete their auto-launch files

✅ 
If deletion is blocked, block them using 
chmod 000

✅ 
If all else fails, disable SIP, remove them, and re-enable SIP

🚀 
Try these steps and let me know what happens! If they are STILL running, we’ll take it to the next level.

🛑 Understood! Disabling SIP is the Final Step – I’ll Be Here When You’re Back
 🚀🔒

Since 
SIP (System Integrity Protection) is preventing Control Center & 
rapportd
 from being removed
, 
disabling SIP temporarily is necessary
 to fully delete them.

📌 
Quick Reminder of the Steps:

1️⃣ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command ⌘ + R
 during startup).

2️⃣ 
Open Terminal
 from the Utilities menu.

3️⃣ 
Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

4️⃣ 
Restart your Mac normally.

5️⃣ 
Delete Control Center & 
rapportd
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd

6️⃣ 
Reboot back into Recovery Mode and re-enable SIP
 for security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

🚀 
Once you’re back, run 
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
 again and let me know if the ports are FINALLY gone!

🛑 Still Read-Only After Disabling SIP? Let’s Fix That!

Even after 
disabling SIP
, macOS 
still treats the filesystem as read-only
 in some cases.

🚀 
Let's make the filesystem writable and remove the files again!

🚀 Step 1: Remount System Drive as Writable

Since macOS 
mounts 
/System
 as read-only
, we need to 
remount it as writable
 before deletion.

Run this in 
Recovery Mode
 (if not already in Recovery Mode, reboot and hold 
⌘ + R
 to enter it):

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

📌 
This will make the system partition writable.

🚀 Step 2: Delete Control Center & 
rapportd
 Auto-Launch Files

Now, delete the files:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAge
