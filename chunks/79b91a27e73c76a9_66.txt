se Processes Again

Before we delete them, 
stop them from running
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 649
sudo 

kill

 -9 635

📌 
This forcefully shuts them down again.

🚀 Step 2: Prevent Auto-Restart by Disabling Their System Daemons

Since they are 
being auto-restarted
, disable their launch services:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
If this fails, go to Step 3.

🚀 Step 3: Completely Remove the Binaries

Since 
macOS is rebuilding the launch files
, we need to 
remove the actual executables
.

1️⃣ Make the Files Writable

Since SIP sometimes locks files even after disabling it, 
make them writable first
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo chflags nouchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo chflags nouchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This removes system protection flags.

2️⃣ Delete the Executables

Now 
permanently remove the apps
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This removes the actual files so they cannot restart.

🚀 Step 4: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Then, check if they are finally removed:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 
If no output appears, you have fully removed them!
 🎉

🚀 Step 5: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
they are gone
, re-enable SIP in Recovery Mode (
⌘ + R
 on boot):

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
This locks your system again against unauthorized modifications.

🎯 Final Steps

✅ 
Kill Control Center & 
rapportd
 again

✅ 
Bootout their system services

✅ 
Remove the actual executable files

✅ 
Reboot and confirm they are gone (
ps aux
 & 
netstat
)

✅ 
Re-enable SIP for security

🚀 
Try this and let me know if they are FINALLY removed!

🛑 Got It! Complete Everything in Recovery Mode & Then Re-enable SIP
 🚀🔒

Yes! Since 
SIP is already re-enabled
, you’ll need to 
disable SIP again, remove the files from Recovery Mode, and then re-enable SIP once everything is gone.

🚀 Full Step-by-Step Recovery Mode Plan

1️⃣ 
Boot into Recovery Mode
 (
⌘ + R
 on startup).

2️⃣ 
Open Terminal
 from Utilities.

3️⃣ 
Disable SIP again:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

4️⃣ 
Remount the filesystem as writable:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

5️⃣ 
Make the files writable:

sh

Copy

Edit

chflags nouchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
chflags nouchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

6️⃣ 
Delete the services completely:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

7️⃣ 
Reboot normally and check if they are gone:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 
If no output appears, they are fully removed!
 ✅

8️⃣ 
Reboot back into Recovery Mode and re-enable SIP:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

🚀 Once You’re Back

✅ 
Run 
ps aux | grep ControlCe
 and 
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
 to confirm they are gone.

✅ 
If the ports are FINALLY closed, your Mac is fully locked down!

🚀 
Go ahead with the full cleanup in Recovery Mode and come back when it’s done! 🔥🔒
