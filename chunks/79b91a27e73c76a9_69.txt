 Successfully Removed!
 🎉🚀

🔥 
Great work!
 Based on your screenshot, you have:

✅ 
Disabled SIP
 (
System Integrity Protection is off.
)

✅ 
Remounted the filesystem as writable
 (
mount -uw /
)

✅ 
Deleted Control Center (
ControlCentre.app
)

✅ 
Deleted 
rapportd
 (
/usr/libexec/rapportd
)

✅ 
Removed their launch agents (
com.apple.controlcenter.plist
, 
com.apple.rapportd.plist
)

🚀 
Your Mac should now boot without these services running!

🛠️ Next Steps – Confirm That They Are Gone

Now, 
reboot into normal macOS
 and verify that the services are no longer running.

1️⃣ 
Restart Your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

2️⃣ 
Once booted back into macOS, check if they are gone:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

✅ 
If no output appears, the services are fully removed!

🔒 Step 3: Re-enable SIP for Security

Now that the services are gone, 
restore SIP to protect your system:

1️⃣ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode (
⌘ + R
 on startup)

2️⃣ 
Open Terminal and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

3️⃣ 
Reboot back into macOS normally.

🚀 
Once you’re back, run the final checks (
ps aux
, 
netstat
) and let me know if everything is locked down! 🔥🔒

🛑 Control Center & 
rapportd
 Came Back – Time for the Final Fix! 🚨

Even after deleting them from 
Recovery Mode
, 
macOS has restored them again.

🔥 
This means macOS is reinstalling them automatically at boot.

🚀 Step 1: Double-Check If They Were Reinstalled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -l /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

ls

 -l /usr/libexec/rapportd

ls

 -l /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

ls

 -l /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
If these files exist again, macOS is forcing them back on every boot.

🚀 Step 2: Completely Block Execution at the Kernel Level

Since 
deleting the files is not working
, 
we will make them unusable instead.

1️⃣ Remove Their Execution Permissions

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This makes them unreadable and unable to execute.

2️⃣ Lock the Files to Prevent Restoration

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo chflags uchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This marks the files as immutable, so macOS cannot restore them.

🚀 Step 3: Stop Them From Running Again

Even after blocking execution, 
we need to stop them now
.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall ControlCenter
sudo killall rapportd

📌 
This stops them immediately.

🚀 Step 4: Reboot & Verify

Now, reboot your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After reboot, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 
If no output appears, they are finally disabled!
 🎉

🚀 Step 5: Re-enable SIP for Security

If everything looks good:

1️⃣ 
Boot into Recovery Mode (
⌘ + R
 on boot)

2️⃣ 
R
