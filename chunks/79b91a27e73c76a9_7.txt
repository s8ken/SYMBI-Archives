To finish installation & run clamav you will need to edit
the example conf files at /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/

To start clamav now and restart at startup:
  sudo brew services start clamav
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/clamav/sbin/clamd --foreground
