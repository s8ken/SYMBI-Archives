 Remove System Daemons That Restart Them

If 
rapportd
 or Control Center keeps returning, 
remove their startup files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This stops macOS from running them at startup.

🚀 Step 6: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Then check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

📌 
If no output appears, they are FINALLY removed! 🎉

🚀 Step 7: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that they are gone
, 
restore SIP
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
Done!
 🚀 
Try these steps and let me know if they are FINALLY gone. 🔥🔒

🛑 Recovery Mode: 
rapportd
 is Already Gone or in a Different Location

🔥 
The "No such file or directory" error means that 
rapportd
 is either already removed or is located somewhere else.

🚨 
Also, 
sudo
 is not available in macOS Recovery Mode, so you don’t need it!

🚀 Step 1: Confirm Whether 
rapportd
 is Still Present

Since 
mv
 failed, 
let’s check if the file exists at all
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /usr/libexec/ | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is already gone! 🎉

📌 
If it still appears, continue to Step 2.

🚀 Step 2: If 
rapportd
 is in a Different Location, Find It

Try searching for 
rapportd
 manually:

sh

Copy

Edit

find / -name rapportd 2>/dev/null

📌 
This will locate the file anywhere on your system.

📌 
If it finds a different path, use that path for the next steps.

🚀 Step 3: If 
rapportd
 Exists, Try Moving It Again

If 
ls
 or 
find
 shows the file still exists, 
try moving it again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

📌 
If this still fails, go to Step 4.

🚀 Step 4: If Moving Still Fails, Delete It Instead

If 
mv
 still doesn’t work, 
force delete it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
Now, 
rapportd
 is permanently gone.

🚀 Step 5: Create a Fake 
rapportd
 So macOS Can’t Restore It

Even if you remove 
rapportd
, 
macOS might try to restore it.

To block this:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This makes 
rapportd
 permanently unusable.

🚀 Step 6: Remove Any Launch Daemons That Restart It

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
remove its startup files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
This prevents macOS from launching it at boot.

🚀 Step 7: Reboot & Confirm Removal

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
sudo launchctl list | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is finally removed! 🎉

🚀 Step 8: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that it is gone
, 
restore SIP to protect your system
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
Done!
 🚀 
Try these steps and let me know if 
rapportd
 is FINALLY gone. 🔥🔒
