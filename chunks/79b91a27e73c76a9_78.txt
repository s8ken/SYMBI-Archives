📌 
If it still appears, note the exact filename and move to Step 2.

🚀 Step 2: If 
rapportd
 Exists in Another Location, Find It

If 
ls
 did not show anything, use this command to locate it:

sh

Copy

Edit

find / -name 

"rapportd"

 2>/dev/null

📌 
This will search your entire system for 
rapportd
.

📌 
If it returns a different path, use that path in Step 3.

🚀 Step 3: If 
rapportd
 Exists, Move or Delete It

If 
find
 or 
ls
 confirms 
rapportd
 still exists, try 
moving it again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

📌 
If this still fails, go to Step 4.

🚀 Step 4: If Moving Still Fails, Force Delete It

If 
mv
 doesn’t work, 
force delete 
rapportd

:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This permanently removes it.

🚀 Step 5: Create a Fake 
rapportd
 to Block macOS from Restoring It

Even after removing 
rapportd
, macOS may try to 
restore it from its cache
.

To 
block this
:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This makes 
rapportd
 permanently unusable.

🚀 Step 6: Remove Any Launch Daemons That Restart 
rapportd

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
remove its startup files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
This ensures macOS does not relaunch it at boot.

🚀 Step 7: Restart & Confirm 
rapportd
 Is Gone

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

Once rebooted, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is finally gone! 🎉

🚀 Step 8: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is confirmed gone, 
restore SIP to protect your system
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
Done!
 🚀 
Try these steps and let me know if 
rapportd
 is FINALLY removed. 🔥🔒

✅ Next Steps: Find and Remove 
rapportd

Since 
rapportd
 is not at 
/usr/libexec/rapportd
, we need to 
locate it first
.

🚀 Step 1: Check If 
rapportd
 Exists at All

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /usr/libexec/ | grep rapportd

📌 
If nothing appears, 
rapportd
 is already removed.
 🎉

📌 
If it appears, continue to Step 2.

🚀 Step 2: Search for 
rapportd
 Anywhere in the System

If 
ls
 does not find it, try searching the entire system:

sh

Copy

Edit

find / -name 

"rapportd"

 2>/dev/null

📌 
If it shows a different path, use that path in the next commands.

📌 
If nothing appears, 
rapportd
 is already gone.
 🎉

🚀 Step 3: If 
rapportd
 Exists, Remove It

If 
find
 shows 
rapportd
 still exists, 
force delete it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
Now, 
rapportd
 is permanently gone.

🚀 Step 4: Prevent macOS from Restoring 
rapportd

Even if you remove 
rapportd
, 
macOS might try to restore it.

To block this:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This creates a fake, non-executable version to prevent macOS from restoring it.

🚀 Step 5: Remove Any Startup Files That Relaunch 
rapportd

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
delete its auto-restart files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
This prevents macOS from launching 
rapportd
 at boot.

🚀 Step 6: Reboot & Confirm 
rapportd
 is Gone

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
