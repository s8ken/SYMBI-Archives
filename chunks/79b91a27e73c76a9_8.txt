m.conf
 to Enable Updates

We need to allow 
FreshClam
 to update the virus database.

Open the configuration file in 
nano editor
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf

Use 
↓ arrow keys
 to navigate.

Find the line that says:

nginx

Copy

Edit

Example

Delete this line
 (it prevents ClamAV from running).

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
 to save and exit.

3️⃣ Edit 
clamd.conf
 for Scanning

Similarly, open the 
clamd.conf
 file:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/clamd.conf

Remove the 
Example
 line the same way.

Save and exit (
CTRL + X, Y, Enter
).

Step 9: Update Virus Database

Now, let’s download the latest malware definitions:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo freshclam

👉 If this works without errors, ClamAV is 
ready to scan!
 ✅

👉 If you get an error, let me know.

Once done, we can proceed to 
running a scan!
