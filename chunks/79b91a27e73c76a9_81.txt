rapportd
 is Now Blocked at the Firewall Level 🚀🔒

From your output:

✅ 

rapportd
 is now listed under blocked apps in the macOS firewall!

✅ 
It can no longer make or receive network connections!
 🎉

🚀 Next Steps: Verify & Double-Lock it

Even though 
rapportd
 is blocked at the firewall, 
macOS might still try to restart it.
 Let’s make sure it stays locked down.

1️⃣ Test if 
rapportd
 is Really Blocked

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is 100% blocked from networking.
 🎉

2️⃣ Kill 
rapportd
 if it’s Running

Even though the firewall blocks it, 
it might still be running in the background
. Let’s kill it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd

📌 
Now, 
rapportd
 should no longer be active.

3️⃣ Prevent 
rapportd
 from Restarting

Now, let’s tell macOS 
not to auto-restart 
rapportd

:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

📌 
This prevents it from being restarted by macOS.
 🚀

4️⃣ Final Check After Reboot

Reboot your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After logging back in, check again:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is gone forever!
 🎉

🚨 
rapportd
 is STILL Running! Let’s Nuke It Completely 🔥

Even though the firewall 
blocks 
rapportd
 from connecting
, it’s still 
running in the background
 and 
listening on port 49152
. 
Let’s kill it permanently!
 🚀

🚀 Step 1: Kill 
rapportd
 Again

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 588

📌 This force-kills 
rapportd
 (⚠️ The PID 
may change
 after a reboot, so check 
ps aux | grep rapportd
 for the latest PID).

🚀 Step 2: Remove It from Startup

Now, 
prevent 
rapportd
 from ever starting again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

📌 
This removes 
rapportd
 from auto-start services.

🚀 Step 3: Delete Any Remaining Files

Since macOS 
restores system files
, let's 
delete any backup copies or caches
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/run/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*

📌 
This ensures macOS cannot restore 
rapportd
.

🚀 Step 4: Make a Fake 
rapportd
 & Block Modifications

Even after deleting 
rapportd
, macOS 
might try to restore it
.

Let’s 
create a fake version
 that 
CANNOT be replaced
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
Now, 
rapportd
 is permanently blocked, even if macOS tries to restore it!

🚀 Step 5: Restart & Verify

Now, 
reboot your Mac
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Then, check again:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is 100% dead!
 🎉

🔥 Step 6: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is confirmed 
fully disabled
, 
turn System Integrity Protection (SIP) back on
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
This ensures no unauthorized modifications can be made to your system.

✅ DONE! 
rapportd
 Should Be Fully Neutralized 🔥

Try these steps and let me know 
if 
rapportd
 is finally gone for good!
