still shows connections
, Lulu is blocking them, but the process is still trying.

✅ Step 2: Stop & Prevent 
rapportd
 from Running

Let’s 
kill 
rapportd
 manually
 to see if it tries to restart:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd

Then, check if it restarted:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd

📌 If 
no output appears
, it’s 
gone!
 🎉

✅ Step 3: Add Extra Protection (Optional)

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
take these extra steps
:

🔒 
Disable 
rapportd
 Completely

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

🚀 
Make a Fake 
rapportd
 File

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This blocks macOS from restoring it!

✅ Final Check: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After rebooting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 **If 
rapportd
 is gone and Lulu shows

🚨 
rapportd
 is STILL Running & Listening! Let’s Shut It Down for Good 🔥

Even though 
Lulu is blocking

rapportd
 from making 
outgoing
 connections, it’s 
still running
 and 
listening on port 49164
. Let’s 
fully disable and remove it
 so it can’t restart. 🚀

🚀 Step 1: Kill 
rapportd
 Again

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 1028

📌 
This force-kills 
rapportd
 immediately.

🚀 Step 2: Stop It from Restarting

Disable 
rapportd
 at the system level:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

📌 
Now, macOS will NOT restart 
rapportd
.

🚀 Step 3: Delete 
rapportd
 from System Locations

Since macOS 
restores system files
, delete all traces:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/run/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*

📌 
Now, no cache files can restore it.

🚀 Step 4: Make a Fake 
rapportd
 File

This 
prevents macOS from re-creating 
rapportd

:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
Now, even if macOS tries to restore 
rapportd
, it CAN’T!
 💀

🚀 Step 5: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After reboot, 
check if 
rapportd
 is gone
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
If there’s NO output, 
rapportd
 is FINALLY DEAD!
 🎉

🔥 Final Step: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once you confirm 
rapportd
 is gone, 
turn System Integrity Protection (SIP) back on
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
This stops macOS from modifying system files again.

✅ 
rapportd
 Should Now Be Completely Neutralized! 🔥

If 
rapportd

still comes back
, let me know and we’ll go 
even deeper
. 💀 🚀

You said:

no no I'm not doing all that again lol not at least right now - its too many reboots and sip on and off and all that - so what happens if we try and utilise it with the Lulu rule on?

😂 
Fair enough! No more reboots for now!
 Let's see what happens if we 
let 
rapportd
 run
 while Lulu 
keeps it on a leash.

🔥 Testing 
rapportd
 with Lulu Blocking It

Since Lulu is 
actively blocking all outbound connections
, 
rapportd

should be running but completely useless.
 Let’s test:

✅ Step 1: Check if 
rapportd
 is Trying to Connect

Run this command to see if 
rapportd
 is 
still attempting network activity
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
Expected result:

No established outbound connections.

📌 If you see 
(LISTEN)
, it means it's running but can’t connect anywhere.

✅ Step 2: Check Lulu's Network Events

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Network Events
.

Look for any 
blocked attempts by
