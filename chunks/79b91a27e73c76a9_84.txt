rapportd

.

📌 
If 
rapportd
 is repeatedly trying and getting blocked, it means it’s completely useless.
 🚀

✅ Step 3: Manually Trigger 
rapportd

Let’s see how it reacts if we 
manually activate it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl start com.apple.rapportd

Then immediately check Lulu logs & active connections:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 If 
Lulu blocks all traffic
, 
rapportd
 is 
neutered
 but still 
alive
 in the system.

🤔 What Happens Next?

If 
rapportd

stays quiet and does nothing
 → 
Lulu is doing its job.

If it 
keeps trying to connect but fails
 → 
It’s running in the background but is 100% ineffective.

If it 
finds a way to connect
 → We’ll need 
extra layers of blocking.

Interesting! 
rapportd
 is still LISTENING, but it’s not making OUTBOUND connections.
 🛑

This means 
Lulu is doing its job
, but 
rapportd
 is still 
active
 in the background. Let’s dig deeper.

🛡️ Step 1: Check If It’s Trying to Connect Out

Since 
rapportd
 is in a 
LISTEN
 state, it’s waiting for something. Let’s check if it’s actually making outbound requests:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | grep rapportd

📌 
Expected:

No output
 (because Lulu is blocking it).

📌 
If there is output
, it found a way past Lulu, and we need to go harder. 🔥

🛡️ Step 2: Watch Lulu’s Logs for Activity

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Network Events
.

Look for 
rapportd
 entries 
(they should be blocked)
.

If 
Lulu shows 
rapportd
 trying and failing
, 
it’s still attempting to connect
, but it’s failing.

📌 
If Lulu is catching & blocking it, it’s effectively useless.

📌 
If there are no logs, 
rapportd
 isn’t even trying to connect anymore.
 🚀

🛡️ Step 3: Force 
rapportd
 to Try & Connect

Let’s provoke 
rapportd
 and see how it reacts:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.rapportd

Then immediately check:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd
sudo netstat -an | grep rapportd

📌 
If it stays in LISTEN mode with no outbound connections
, it’s harmless.

📌 
If it tries and Lulu blocks it
, it’s like a dog on a leash—it’s still barking, but it can’t bite.

🔥 What This Means

🚀 If 
rapportd

stays in LISTEN mode and can’t reach out
, it’s 
not a risk.

🔥 If it keeps trying to connect, we’ll 
double-layer block it at the firewall level
 (or go nuclear later).

✅ Conclusion: Lulu is Holding 
rapportd
 Hostage

Right now, 
rapportd
 is 
like a zombie—it’s running but completely caged.

If it can’t make outbound requests, it can’t do anything.

Let me know 
what the netstat check shows
 and if Lulu logs confirm it’s blocked. 🚀

 is Completely Neutered! 🚀

🔥 
No 
ESTABLISHED
 connections mean 
rapportd
 is running, but it’s totally useless!
 🔥

🛡️ What This Means

✅ 

rapportd
 is stuck in LISTEN mode
, waiting for something to happen.

✅ 
It cannot make outbound connections
—Lulu is blocking it.

✅ 
No network communication = No security risk.

In simple terms:

💀 
rapportd
 is alive but 
totally trapped.
 It’s like a zombie 
locked in a cage
—harmless, unless you let it out.

🚀 Next Steps (If You Want)

1️⃣ 
Keep Lulu running
—it’s preventing 
rapportd
 from ever connecting.

2️⃣ 
Monitor it occasionally with:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd
sudo netstat -an | grep rapportd

(Just to make sure it never sneaks out.)
