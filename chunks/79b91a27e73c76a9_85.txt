🤔 Was It Lulu or Handoff? Let’s Investigate! 🔍

🔥 
Good catch!

rapportd
 is directly linked to 
Handoff, AirDrop, and Continuity features
 in macOS.

If Handoff was 
enabled
, it 
could have been the reason 
rapportd
 was running.

✅ Step 1: Test by Disabling Handoff

1️⃣ Open 
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
AirDrop & Handoff

2️⃣ 
Turn OFF
:

Handoff

Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices

3️⃣ Now, 
kill 
rapportd
 again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd

4️⃣ Check if it restarts:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd

📌 
If 
rapportd
 does NOT restart, it means Handoff was the trigger!
 🎯

📌 
If 
rapportd
 starts again, Lulu is likely blocking its network traffic.

✅ Step 2: Does 
rapportd
 Still Try to Connect?

Run this again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
If it’s gone, that means turning off Handoff was enough.

📌 
If it’s still "LISTENING" but not connected, Lulu is stopping its network traffic.

🔥 What This Means

If Handoff was causing 
rapportd
 to run
, it might be 
harmless
 and just a feature of macOS.

If Lulu was blocking it, 
rapportd
 was trying to make external connections
—which is more concerning.

🚀 
Try turning off Handoff and let me know if 
rapportd
 disappears completely!

🔥 CONFIRMED: 
rapportd
 is Still Running, But We Know Why!

🚀 
Since Handoff was enabled, 
rapportd
 was likely running for Apple’s Continuity features.
 Now, let’s confirm if disabling Handoff actually stops it from restarting.

✅ Step 1: Kill 
rapportd
 Again

Now that 
Handoff is turned off
, let’s manually 
kill 
rapportd

 and see if it stays gone.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd

📌 
This should stop 
rapportd
 immediately.

✅ Step 2: Does It Restart?

Now check if 

rapportd
 comes back:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd

📌 
If 
rapportd
 is GONE
, then Handoff was the cause. 🎉

📌 
If 
rapportd
 RESTARTS, something else is triggering it.

✅ Step 3: Check if It’s Still Trying to Connect

Even if 
rapportd
 is running, it might still be 
blocked from doing anything
. Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears
, 
rapportd
 is running but can’t talk to the internet. 🛑

🚀 Final Thoughts

If 
rapportd
 disappears after killing it
, 
Handoff was the reason it kept running
 ✅

If it restarts automatically, there’s another macOS process triggering it.
 🔥

If Lulu is blocking its network traffic, it’s alive but totally useless.
