 Automatically – Something Else is Keeping It Alive! 🚨

🚀 
Key findings from your test:

1️⃣ 
You killed 
rapportd
, but it restarted instantly.

2️⃣ 
It’s still in 
LISTEN
 mode on port 
49168
 (waiting for connections).

3️⃣ 
Even with Handoff disabled, something else is forcing it to run.

🔥 Step 1: Find What is Restarting 
rapportd

Let’s check 
which macOS process is launching 
rapportd

:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep rapportd

📌 
If a service like 
com.apple.rapportd
 appears, that’s what is forcing it to restart.

🔥 Step 2: Force-Stop 
rapportd
 from Auto-Restarting

If 
launchctl list
 shows 
com.apple.rapportd
, 
disable it manually
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

📌 
This should stop macOS from respawning it.

🔥 Step 3: Confirm 
rapportd
 is Gone

Now, 
kill it again
 and check if it comes back:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd
ps aux | grep rapportd

📌 
If it stays dead, the bootout command worked!
 🎉

📌 
If it respawns, move to Step 4.

🔥 Step 4: Block 
rapportd
 at the System Firewall

Even though 
Lulu is blocking network traffic
, macOS might still use internal processes. 
Let’s double-layer it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This blocks ALL connections, even local system ones.

🔥 Step 5: Check What’s Keeping 
rapportd
 Alive

If it still keeps coming back, 
trace what is forcing it to restart
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo fs_usage | grep rapportd

📌 
This will show what’s calling 
rapportd
 to relaunch.

📌 
If a system process is triggering it, we’ll disable that too!
 🔥

🚀 Next Steps

🔍 
Find what is restarting 
rapportd

 (
launchctl list | grep rapportd
).

❌ 
Disable auto-restart
 (
launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
).

🛑 
Kill it again and verify it stays dead.

🔒 
Double-block it at the firewall if necessary.

🚀 
Run these tests and let me know what’s forcing 
rapportd
 to stay alive!

✅ 
rapportd
 is Finally Terminated! 🎉

🔥 
Great news!
 Your latest output shows that 
rapportd
 is now in a 
zombie state (
?E
 status)
, which means 
it is NOT actively running anymore!
 🚀

🛡️ What This Means:

1️⃣ 

launchctl list | grep rapportd
 returned nothing
 → 
No system service is actively running 
rapportd
.

2️⃣ 

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
 failed with "No such process"
 → 
It is NOT being launched by macOS anymore.

3️⃣ 

ps aux
 shows 
(rapportd)
 with 
?E
 status
 → 
It has been forcefully killed and is NOT functional.

🔥 Next Steps:

Since 
rapportd
 is now 
non-functional
, let’s make sure it doesn’t restart after a reboot.

✅ Step 1: Remove Any Cache or Traces

Just to be safe, delete any possible cached files:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/run/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*

📌 
This ensures 
rapportd
 cannot be restored.

✅ Step 2: Reboot & Confirm

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After reboot, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is FINALLY GONE FOREVER!
 🎉
