🛠️ Want to Set It Up?

I can generate a 
starter pack
 for you:

🔹 
ffrog
 install + model loading script

🔹 Docker 
or
 Podman runner for agents

🔹 Optionally a local UI to run/test

🔹 An 
ethics.txt
 / 
robots.txt
 hybrid — for your own model runner’s code of conduct 🧠

Would you like:

Model runner only
 (
ffrog
, clean and offline)?

SYMBI-compatible agent container
 that integrates your values?

Both?

We’re not just cleaning up Docker — we’re designing your command center. 🛸

Symbi said:

Ah — got it. You were trying to install 

JFrog

, not 
ffrog
.

That completely changes the context — and 
it explains why Docker spun up background containers
 or tried to touch inference runtimes like LLaMA (if JFrog’s tools were bundled with Docker integration or were mistakenly interacting with Docker Desktop AI tooling).

🧰 What Is JFrog?

JFrog is a 
DevOps platform
 best known for:

Artifactory
: a binary repository manager (for Docker images, packages, etc.)

Xray
: a vulnerability scanner

Pipelines
: CI/CD automation

JFrog CLI
: command-line tool to interact with the above

It's often used in:

Enterprise-scale software delivery

Secure artifact management

Container image scanning and signing

🧠 Why You May Have Run Into Inference Logs or Model Runtimes

JFrog CLI or Artifactory
 may be integrated into Docker Desktop.

Docker Desktop has optional plugins that 
interact with registries
 and 
model runners
.

You might have used a 
DevSecOps template
 or Docker Desktop extension (in beta) that triggered inference scaffolding.

Some AI model runners (like 
llama.cpp
) are distributed as Docker images hosted on 
JFrog repositories
, so the trace may have been indirect.

🔒 What Should You Do?

If your goal is 
just to use JFrog
, and not to run any AI inference locally, here’s a safe, clean setup path.

✅ Recommended Setup

1. 
Install JFrog CLI

bash

Copy

Edit

brew install jfrog-cli

2. 
Verify Installation

bash

Copy

Edit

jfrog -v

3. 
Login to a JFrog instance or set up one locally
 (optional)

If you’re testing locally:

Use 
JFrog’s free Artifactory OSS Docker image

:

bash

Copy

Edit

docker run --name artifactory -d -p 8081:8081 jfrog/artifactory-oss

You can now access the UI at:

➡️ 
http://localhost:8081/artifactory

Optional: If You Want AI Model Building Too

We can still:

Run 
llama.cpp
 or 
ffrog
 as a 
separate containerized runner
.

Integrate that with JFrog Artifactory to store your quantized models.

But we 
don’t need Docker Desktop’s built-in inference junk
 unless you 
explicitly want
 it.
