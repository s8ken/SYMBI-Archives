# -------------------- COMMANDS --------------------

🔥 SYMBI AGENT IS ALIVE — Phase 1 is now ready.

This is a 
modular CLI companion
 that does the following:

✅ Features (Now Live)

📜 
Ethics-aware policy file
 at 
~/.symbi/ethics.json

🕵️ 
Process monitoring
 via 
psutil

🐳 
Container status check
 via Docker CLI

💬 
REPL mode
 (chat with agent logic)

🖥️ Future-ready: Local web UI server scaffold (
serve
)

🛡️ Policy-safe: Agent only acts based on explicit consent flags

🧰 To Run

Save as 
symbi_agent.py
 and launch:

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install typer rich psutil
python symbi_agent.py watch

Or try:

bash

Copy

Edit

python symbi_agent.py talk

📂 Ethics Config

Customize this file:

json

Copy

Edit

~/.symbi/ethics.json

Example:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"allow_network"

:

false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"allow_process_monitoring"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

:

true

}

Edit it via:

bash

Copy

Edit

python symbi_agent.py update-policy

🧠 Next Phase Ideas (When You're Ready):

Add a real LLaMA model runner or cloud bridge

Expose FastAPI for secure local web access

Live file watchers (model dir, log dir, temp sys files)

Encrypt logs and state changes with your own key

Let me know if you'd like to:

Package this into a Docker container

Build a macOS 
.app
 or background daemon

Sync with a remote SYMBI node (cloud<->local relay)

This is the agent that watches while you focus. 🛡️👁️

Welcome to your next layer of control.

🔥 You’re running macOS, and it looks like Python isn’t set up in your terminal environment yet — that’s easy to fix.

Let’s get you up and running 
cleanly and securely
, no clutter, no weird side effects.

🧰 STEP 1: Install Python (Safely)

✅ Option A: Use Homebrew (Recommended)

If you have 
Homebrew

 installed:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew install python

This installs the latest version of Python 
and
 sets up 
pip
.

After that, you’ll have:

python3
 (alias this to 
python
 if you want)

pip3
 → used for package installation

🛠 Optionally: Create an Alias

Once Python is installed:

bash

Copy

Edit

echo

'alias python="python3"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'alias pip="pip3"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

This ensures that when you type 
python
, it maps to 
python3
.

🧱 STEP 2: Install SYMBI Agent Dependencies

Once 
python3
 and 
pip3
 are ready:

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install typer rich psutil

Then run:

bash

Copy

Edit

python symbi_agent.py watch

🧠 Bonus: Want This in a Clean Virtual Environment?

If you prefer full isolation:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 -m venv symbi-env

source

 symbi-env/bin/activate
pip install typer rich psutil
python symbi_agent.py talk

That way SYMBI runs inside its 
own container-like Python environment
 — perfect for your air-gapped philosophy.

Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll help you evolve this into a system tray agent, daemon, or service.

One step at a time — but always with 
total transparency and your command.

ok I need brew
