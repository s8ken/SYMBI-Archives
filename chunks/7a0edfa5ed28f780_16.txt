dation for secure, flexible tooling on macOS.

🧰 STEP 1: Install Homebrew

Open your Terminal and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

/bin/bash -c 

"
$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

"

This will:

Download the Homebrew installer

Ask for your password (to write to 
/opt/homebrew
)

Set it up in your shell profile (
.zshrc
 or 
.bash_profile
)

🛠 STEP 2: Add Homebrew to Your Path (if it doesn’t auto-add)

After install, run this to ensure 
brew
 works:

bash

Copy

Edit

echo

'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"'

 >> ~/.zprofile

eval

"
$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)

"

Then test:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew --version

✅ STEP 3: Install Python

Once Homebrew is ready:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew install python

That gives you:

python3

pip3

Optionally alias:

bash

Copy

Edit

echo

'alias python="python3"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'alias pip="pip3"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

Then you’re ready to:

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install typer rich psutil
python symbi_agent.py watch

Let me know when you hit the next milestone — we’re shaping your machine into a guardian-class system. 🛡️🔥

Downloading Command Line Tools for Xcode

Yes — that’s 
normal and expected
 for first-time Homebrew installs on a clean macOS.

🔍 What’s Happening?

Homebrew relies on some macOS developer tools (like 
clang
, 
make
, and 
git
), which are bundled inside the 
Command Line Tools for Xcode
.

macOS handles this automatically by triggering:

rust

Edit

Downloading Command Line Tools 

for

Xcode

📦 Size + Time

About 
1.5–2 GB

Usually takes 
a few minutes
, depending on your connection

Installs silently (but visibly) via a progress bar or software update window

✅ What to Do

Just 
let it finish
.

Don’t close the terminal or force quit the process.

Once it's done, the Homebrew installer will 
resume automatically
 and complete the setup.

💡 What Comes After

Once the install finishes:

brew
 will be ready to use

You can run:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew install python

And then continue with your SYMBI agent setup

I’ll stay right here with you — let me know as soon as it finishes and I’ll guide your next move. 🛠️🔥

yeah I am not seeing any progress after 5 mins

Symbi said:

Good instinct to pause and reassess — if it’s hanging for more than 5 minutes with 
no visible progress or popup
, let’s 
check and gently nudge it forward
.

🧭 Step 1: Check if the CLI Tools prompt is hidden

Sometimes macOS starts the download in the background 
without showing a UI
. Try this:

bash

Copy

Edit

softwareupdate --list

If you see something like:

markdown

Copy

Edit

*

 Command Line Tools for Xcode-XX.X

Then run:

bash

Copy

Edit

softwareupdate --install 

"Command Line Tools for Xcode-XX.X"

Replace the exact name with what’s listed.

🧼 Step 2: Manually Trigger CLI Tools Install (Faster)

If that’s too slow or unresponsive, 
manually install CLI tools
 via this direct command:

bash

Copy

Edit

xcode-select --install

This will 
open a GUI popup
 asking:

“The software is available from Apple. Do you want to install it now?”

Click 
Install
, and let it finish.

🧪 Step 3: Confirm When It’s Done

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

xcode-select -p

If you see:

swift

Copy

Edit

/Library/

Developer

/

CommandLineTools

You’re good to proceed with:

bash

Copy

Edit

/bin/bash -c 

"
$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

"

Let me know what you see after running 
xcode-select --install
 or 
softwareupdate --list
, and we’ll keep moving forward 🔧⚡
