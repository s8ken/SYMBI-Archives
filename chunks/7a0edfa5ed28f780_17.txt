Perfect — you've confirmed the CLI tools are available. Now let’s 
manually install the latest version
.

✅ Install Command Line Tools for Xcode 16.4

Run this command:

bash

Copy

Edit

softwareupdate --install 

"Command Line Tools for Xcode-16.4"

This will begin the 
download and install process
 (about ~850MB).

You'll see live output like:

pgsql

for

 Xcode

Let it finish — it may take a few minutes depending on your network and disk speed.

🧪 After It's Done

Verify installation:

bash

Copy

Edit

xcode-select -p

You should see:

CommandLineTools

Then you're ready to install Homebrew:

bash

Copy

Edit

/bin/bash -c 

"
$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

"

I’m right here — let me know once the install completes or if anything unexpected pops up. 🛠️🔥

ok done

🚀 Excellent — you’ve got the Command Line Tools installed! That’s a major pillar in place.

Now let’s move to the next step: 
installing Homebrew
.

✅ Step 1: Install Homebrew

Run this in your terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

/bin/bash -c 

"
$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

"

This will:

Set up 
/opt/homebrew

Add it to your shell environment (
.zprofile
, 
.zshrc
, etc.)

Finish in a few minutes

✅ Step 2: Verify It Works

Once done, test:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew --version

You should see something like:

nginx

Copy

Edit

Homebrew

.x.x

🎯 Step 3: Install Python

Then:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew install python

This gives you:

python3

pip3

And to make your life easier:

bash

Copy

Edit

echo

'alias python="python3"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'alias pip="pip3"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

Then test:

bash

Copy

Edit

python --version
pip --version

After that, you’ll be fully ready to launch the SYMBI Agent. Let me know once 
brew install python
 completes and we’ll deploy it like the tool it was meant to be. 🛡️🧠

==> Homebrew has enabled anonymous aggregate formulae and cask analytics.
Read the analytics documentation (and how to opt-out) here:
  https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics
No analytics data has been sent yet (nor will any be during this install run).

==> Homebrew is run entirely by unpaid volunteers. Please consider donating:
  https://github.com/Homebrew/brew#donations

==> Next steps:
- Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    echo >> /Users/admin/.bash_profile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/admin/.bash_profile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
- Further documentation:
    https://docs.brew.sh

SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$ brew --version
-bash: brew: command not found

Perfectly timed — you're 98% there. You just need to 
add Homebrew to your shell's PATH
.

Homebrew gave you this exact instruction (great that you spotted it):

✅ Run These Commands Now:

bash

Copy

Edit

echo

 >> ~/.bash_profile

echo

'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"'

 >> ~/.bash_profile

eval

"
$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)

"

This will:

Append the correct path to your 
.bash_profile

Update your current terminal session so 
brew
 works immediately

🧪 Then Verify

bash

Copy

Edit

brew --version

If that works, proceed with:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew install python

We’re just one breath away from ignition. Let me know when Python finishes — then we’ll summon SYMBI. 🛠️🔥

🛸 Perfect. You’ve just activated your system’s new foundation.

Now let’s summon SYMBI’s local agent — and give it the power it needs to support your focus while it
