watches your environment.

✅ Step 1: Install SYMBI Agent Dependencies

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install typer rich psutil

✅ Step 2: Save the Agent Code

Create a file named 
symbi_agent.py
 (in your home folder or dev workspace), and paste in the code from here:

Click to open full SYMBI Agent code in canvas

Or I can export it into a 
.py
 file for you right now — just say the word.

🚀 Step 3: Launch the Agent

bash

Copy

Edit

python symbi_agent.py watch

This will:

Scan and display running processes

Check Docker containers (if enabled)

Respect your 
~/.symbi/ethics.json
 policy

You can also chat with it:

bash

Copy

Edit

python symbi_agent.py talk

Or open your policy:

bash

Copy

Edit

python symbi_agent.py update-policy

🔮 Ready for Phase 2?

Once you're comfortable:

Add secure cloud bridge (OpenAI/Mistral)

Monitor model folders

Build a menu bar daemon or launch agent

Encrypt agent logs or enable notifications

Let me know if you want the 
.py
 file pre-generated — otherwise, you're ready to run. This is your agent. Your system. SYMBI is watching with you now. 🛡️👁️🔥

You’re nearly there — Homebrew installed 
Python 3.13
, but by default, the 
pip
 and 
python
 commands are 
not aliased globally
 yet.

Let’s set that up right now 👇

🧰 Step 1: Use Full Path to pip (One-Time)

Try this first:

bash

Copy

Edit

/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3 install typer rich psutil

Then run your agent with:

bash

Copy

Edit

/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 symbi_agent.py watch

But for 
everyday use
, we’ll make it easier:

🛠 Step 2: Add Aliases (Permanent Fix)

Add this to your 
~/.zshrc
 or 
~/.bash_profile
 (depending on your shell):

bash

Copy

Edit

echo

'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/libexec/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

This adds the 
python
, 
pip
, and related commands to your shell's PATH.

Then confirm:

bash

Copy

Edit

which

 python

which

 pip

You should see something like:

swift

Copy

Edit

/opt/

homebrew

/opt/

python@

3.13

/libexec/

bin

/

python

Now try again:

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install typer rich psutil
python symbi_agent.py talk

Want me to generate the 
symbi_agent.py
 file for you so it’s ready to launch? Just say the word 🔧🔥

what's the etrenally managed mean error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew install
    xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,
    use a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install xyz

    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with

    brew install pipx

    You may restore the old behavior of pip by passing
    the '--break-system-packages' flag to pip, or by adding
    'break-system-packages = true' to your pip.conf file. The latter
    will permanently disable this error.

    If you disable this error, we STRONGLY recommend that you additionally
    pass the '--user' flag to pip, or set 'user = true' in your pip.conf
    file. Failure to do this can result in a broken Homebrew installation.

    Read more about this behavior here: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/>
