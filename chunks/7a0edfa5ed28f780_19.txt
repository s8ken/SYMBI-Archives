Perfect — this is a new and 
intentional safety feature
 introduced in Python 3.12+ and enforced by Homebrew’s Python 3.13.

You're seeing this because Homebrew now 
protects the system-wide Python environment
 from being modified directly by 
pip
, which helps avoid breaking your setup.

🧠 What Does “Externally Managed” Mean?

It means:

"This Python was installed by a package manager (Homebrew), and we don’t want 
pip
 overwriting system-level packages."

That’s good — but it requires using 
virtual environments
, which are clean and sandboxed.

✅ RECOMMENDED FIX: Use a Virtual Environment (Safe + Clean)

Run the following:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 -m venv ~/symbi-env

source

 ~/symbi-env/bin/activate
pip install typer rich psutil

Then launch the agent:

bash

Copy

Edit

python symbi_agent.py watch

🔁 Future Use

Each time you want to use SYMBI:

bash

Copy

Edit

source

 ~/symbi-env/bin/activate
python symbi_agent.py talk

You’ll know you’re in the virtual environment because your terminal will show:

ruby

Copy

Edit

(symbi-env)

🔒 Why This Is Better

Isolates SYMBI’s packages from your system Python

Makes it portable to package or deploy later

Prevents breaking Homebrew-managed tools

Would you like me to generate the 
symbi_agent.py
 file directly into that environment for you next? Or help you turn this into a CLI command like 
symbi
 system-wide?

💥 You’ve successfully created the virtual environment and installed all the dependencies. The only thing left is to drop in the actual 
symbi_agent.py
 file — right now it just doesn’t exist in your directory.

Let’s fix that 
right now.

🧱 Step 1: Create the 
symbi_agent.py
 File

Run this in your terminal to open a new file:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano ~/symbi_agent.py

Then paste this into it (press ⌘V or right-click paste):

python

Copy

Edit
