ronment Is Active

If you’re not already in your virtual environment, activate it:

bash

Copy

Edit

source

 symbi-env/bin/activate

You should see 
(symbi-env)
 in your prompt.

2. 
Make Sure 
symbi_agent.py
 Exists

Confirm your file:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 ~/symbi_agent.py

If it exists, great. If not, copy-paste the version from your canvas into:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano ~/symbi_agent.py

3. 
Run the Ethics Policy Setup (auto on first run)

Run this once:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

You should see:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"allow_network"

:

false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"allow_process_monitoring"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

:

true

}

If this works, your config is set.

4. 
Monitor Local Security

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

This checks:

🧠 Running processes

🐳 Docker containers (if Docker is installed & running)

If 
allow_container_scans
 is 
false
 in your policy, it will skip that part.

5. 
Edit Your Ethics Policy (optional)

To update permissions:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py update-policy

It will open the 
.json
 file. Change values like:

json

Copy

Edit

"allow_network"

:

true

Then save and rerun 
watch
.

6. 
REPL Mode (just for talking)

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

SYMBI will greet you and let you type. This is where we'll later plug in LLMs, local actions, or voice interfaces.

🧱 Next Milestone

Once this all works, we'll:

Add 
data queueing and report bundling

Allow 
secure cloud bridging
 (GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.)

Integrate 
LLM-powered response modes

Let me know where you are in the steps — I’ll walk you forward from there. 👁️🔥

Perfect — you’re inside your 
symbi-env
, ready to run the agent. Here's 
exactly what to do next
, step by step:

✅ 
Step 1: View the Ethics Policy

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

You should see the JSON output like this:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"allow_network"

:

false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"allow_process_monitoring"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

:

true

}

If that prints correctly — your config is loaded and working ✅

✅ 
Step 2: Run the Security Watch Command

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

You should see:

A list of running system processes

(Optional) Docker containers if Docker is installed and running

If Docker isn't installed, you’ll see:

css

Copy

Edit

[yellow]

Docker not found. Skipping container check.

[/yellow]

This is expected and clean — no error, just a skip.

✅ 
Step 3: Try REPL Mode

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

You’ll get:

pgsql

Copy

Edit

SYMBI REPL started. 

Type

'exit'

to

 quit.
symbi >

Type something like:

nginx

Copy

Edit

hello

And it’ll echo back with SYMBI’s response.

🛠 Optional: Edit the Policy

Want to enable network functions later?

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Then change 
"allow_network": false
 to 
true
 if you want SYMBI to push to GitHub/HuggingFace later.

Let me know after Step 2 runs — and we’ll start building the cloud integration bridge (e.g. Hugging Face auth, Docker push, GitHub commit). 🧠🛰️

You said:

SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$ source symbi-env/bin/activate
(symbi-env) SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$ python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
SYMBI REPL started. Type 'exit' to quit.

Perfect signal received: you're inside the virtual environment, but the command:
