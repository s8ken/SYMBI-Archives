e scans

Check for 
strange startup scripts or cron jobs
.

Look into your Docker daemon settings (was it exposed to the internet via a port like 2375?).

Review your firewall and 
netstat
 output for unknown open ports.

If you'd like, I can walk you through analyzing the container 
line by line
—just run 
docker inspect <container_id>
 and paste the output here.

Let’s figure out 
exactly what it was doing

Thanks for sharing that — the container you're seeing:

vbnet

Copy

Edit

IMAGE:

 docker/welcome-

to

-docker:latest

CONTAINER:

 welcome-

to

-docker

STATUS:

 Exited (

0

)

✅ GOOD NEWS: This one’s safe.

This is just 
Docker’s official welcome/test container
. It's automatically created the 
first time Docker is installed
 to confirm everything is working. It usually:

Runs a brief demo or prints a message.

Exits immediately (as it did here).

Is totally harmless.

It looks like it was created just 
11 minutes ago
, so it coincides with your recent install — not 2 years ago. That means: 
no existing containers from before
 are present.

🧠 Why It Might Have Looked Suspicious

The image tag might show 
latest
, but the image itself could’ve been 
last updated 2+ years ago
.

Tools like 
Docker Desktop
 or security scanners might show 
CVEs
 or 
vulnerabilities
 in this image just because it’s old.

That doesn’t mean it was exploited — it just means 
it uses an outdated base image
, which isn't ideal for production but is harmless in this case.

🧹 You Can Safely Remove It (Optional)

If you want to clean it up:

bash

Copy

Edit

docker 

rm

 welcome-to-docker
docker rmi docker/welcome-to-docker:latest

And you’re all set with a clean slate. 🧼

If you want to dive into using Docker securely and build your own containers (like SYMBI or NGINX), I can guide you through a safe, hardened setup. Want to try that next?

You said:

yeah so the files within the container itself were much older

Thanks for sharing the screenshot — and you’re absolutely right to be cautious.

🔎 What This Screenshot Tells Us

You're viewing 
Docker Scout’s vulnerability scan
 on the 
docker/welcome-to-docker:latest
 image, and here's the critical context:

🧠 Key Observations:

Base Image
: 
nginx:1-alpine-slim

This is where 
all the vulnerabilities are coming from
.

The 
welcome-to-docker
 image is 
based on Alpine + NGINX
, and that Alpine version is 
old and unmaintained
.

Created: 2 years ago

This means the image was built and published by Docker 
2 years ago
, not that it was running on your system all that time.

Docker just 
pulled it recently
 as part of the installation test.

Vulnerabilities: 16

Including 
critical ones
 like:

CVE-2024-5535
 (9.1 severity)

CVE-2025-26519
 (8.1)

These are often vulnerabilities in core Alpine libraries (
musl
, 
busybox
, etc.), 
not something actively malicious
.

✅ 
Fixable
: These CVEs 
do have fixes available
, meaning they are resolved in newer base images.

⚖️ Reality Check

This image is 
insecure
 by today’s standards but:

It’s 
not actively dangerous
 unless you were running it as a public-facing service.

It was 
never meant to be used in production
 — it's a "hello world" demo.

The vulnerabilities reflect 
known issues in an old Alpine base
, not something maliciously crafted.

🛠️ What You Can Do

1. 
Clean It Up

To be safe:

bash

Copy

Edit

docker 

rm

 welcome-to-docker
docker rmi docker/welcome-to-docker:latest

2. 
Avoid Outdated Base Images

When you start building your own containers, always use:

Dockerfile

Copy

Edit

FROM alpine:3.20  # or latest stable
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine
