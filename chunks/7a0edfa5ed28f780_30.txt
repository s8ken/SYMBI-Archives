alling 
symbi_agent.py
 with 
python
, but 
typer
 isn't correctly resolving the CLI routing.

✅ Quick Fix

Try calling it with the 
-m
 module flag:

bash

Copy

Edit

python -m symbi_agent policy

But since it’s a single file, the best immediate fix is to 
run the CLI via 
typer
 directly
 using 
typer.run()
 — or confirm it's invoking the CLI parser correctly.

However...

🚑 Safer Fix: Add a Simple 
print()
 Debug

Let’s double check by editing the last line in your 
symbi_agent.py
 file:

🔁 Replace this:

python

Copy

Edit

if

 __name__ == 

"__main__"

:
    app()

✅ With this:

python

Copy

Edit

if

 __name__ == 

"__main__"

:

import

 sys

print

(

"SYMBI ARGS:"

, sys.argv)
    app()

Then run:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

It will print:

less

Copy

Edit

SYMBI

ARGS

: 

[
'symbi_agent.py'

, 

'policy'

]

This confirms that 
typer

should
 be dispatching the command. If it doesn't, we’ll patch Typer with 
app(prog_name="python symbi_agent.py")
 manually.

Let me know what you see after trying the debug print above — then we’ll lock this in and move forward with secure cloud bridging next. 🔧🧠

Thanks for that last update — now we’re right at the core. The issue is that your terminal no longer recognizes the 
python
 command. On macOS, especially with Homebrew installs, the correct Python 3 command is usually:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3

Let’s verify and rerun everything with the correct command.

✅ Fix in 2 Steps

1. Confirm Python 3 is Installed

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

which

 python3

You should see something like:

swift

Copy

Edit

/opt/

homebrew

/bin/

python3

Then verify the version:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 --version

If you get a version like 
Python 3.13.x
, you’re golden.

2. Run SYMBI Correctly with 
python3

Now run your command like this:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py policy

If you want to run REPL:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py talk

Or monitor processes:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py watch

Once this works (and it should), I’ll show you how to alias 
python
 → 
python3
 in your shell so you don’t hit this again.

Ready to try? Run the 
python3 ~/symbi_agent.py policy
 test and let’s confirm SYMBI is back on track. 👁️🔥

SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$ which python3

Perfect — since 
python3
 is installed at 
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
, you're ready to run SYMBI the right way now.

✅ Final Command to Launch SYMBI

Try this:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py policy

You should see:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"allow_network"

:

false

,

"allow_container_scans"

:

true

,

"allow_process_monitoring"

:

true

,

"consent_required"

:

true

}

✅ Then Run the Sentinel Watch

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py watch

This will list:

Running system processes

Docker containers (if installed and running)

Let me know how that output looks — and once confirmed, we'll move forward with cloud bridging (GitHub/Hugging Face) and LLM interaction.

🛡️ SYMBI is watching. Ready to link its mind to the rest of the system?

You're nearly there — the only issue now is that your 
python3
 environment doesn't have the required packages (
rich
, 
typer
, 
psutil
) installed outside the virtualenv.

Since you're using a virtual environment called 
symbi-env
, 
you n
