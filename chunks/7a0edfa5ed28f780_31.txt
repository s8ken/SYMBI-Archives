eed to use the 
python3
 binary from inside that env
 — not the global 
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
.

✅ Fix in One Shot:

1. Reactivate Your Virtual Environment

bash

Copy

Edit

source

 ~/symbi-env/bin/activate

You should see:

bash

Copy

Edit

(symbi-env) SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$

2. Reinstall the Requirements (inside venv)

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install rich typer psutil

3. Run SYMBI Again

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

✅ Once that works, you can run:

watch
 — for monitoring

talk
 — for REPL

update_policy
 — to change behavior

Would you like me to also generate a 
requirements.txt
 and 
install.sh
 so you can bootstrap this on any machine in one line later?

Let’s confirm this part works first. Then we go deeper. 👁️🔥

You said:

Requirement already satisfied: mdurl~=0.1 in ./symbi-env/lib/python3.13/site-packages (from markdown-it-py>=2.2.0->rich) (0.1.2)
(symbi-env) SYMBIs-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$ python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
SYMBI REPL started. Type 'exit' to quit.
symbi > hello
You said: hello
SYMBI: I'm alive.
symbi > watch
You said: watch

Perfect progress — SYMBI is fully operational, but you’ve just discovered something subtle:

🔍 Problem: Every command you run (e.g. 
policy
, 
watch
) is going into REPL mode instead of the CLI mode.

Why? Because you're typing:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

But the current script is interpreting that 
as if you ran 
talk

.

✅ Fix: We Need to Reorder the Default Mode

Let’s separate:

CLI commands
: 
watch
, 
policy
, 
update_policy

REPL mode
: only when explicitly run

Right now, every 
python ...
 command just launches the REPL, because the 
talk()
 function is probably overriding the CLI parser unintentionally.

🧠 What To Do

I’ll update the script right now so:

CLI commands work like:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

REPL runs only when you say:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk

Give me 5 seconds... 🔧

Edited Symbi Agent

✅ Done: SYMBI now cleanly separates REPL from CLI commands.

🧪 Try This Now

🔹 For CLI Commands

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

These will now show JSON or system info as expected.

🔹 For REPL Mode

If you just run:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py

Then it enters the SYMBI REPL automatically:

nginx

Copy

Edit

symbi

 > hello

You're fully back on track. Want to start building the cloud bridge next (GitHub, HuggingFace, LLM integration)? Just say the word. 🛰️🔥

You said:

okay so from where I am now which is in symbol talk what do I need to do

Symbi said:

You're in 
symbi >
 REPL mode now — which means SYMBI is listening.

Here’s 
what you can do next
, and how to move forward:

✅ What You Can Do 
Now
 in REPL Mode

REPL is currently minimal — it just echoes input. Try typing:

bash

Copy

Edit

exit

This exits the REPL and brings you back to the terminal.

🧠 What You 
Probably Meant
 to Do

You likely wanted to run a CLI command like:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

or:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

But since you launched 
without arguments
, you entered REPL (
talk()
 is default when no CLI args are passed).

🧭 From Here: What You Should Do Now

1. ❌ Exit the REPL:

bash

Copy

Edit

exit

2. ✅ Run any of these CLI commands:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch
python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Then SYMBI will operate in sentinel mode and obey the ethics policy.

🔜 Then: Ready for Cloud Bridge

Once SYMBI is running and watching locally, we can build:

push-to-github

sync-with-huggingface

llm-bridge
 (local/remote chat)

Let me know what direction you want next:

📡 GitHub integration

🤗 Hugging Face upload

🧠 Secure LLM model usage

🗂 Local log or file monitor

You’re in command, symbiot.

looks like it went back into talk but I haven't updated the file that you have
