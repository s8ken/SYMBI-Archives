Perfect — thanks for confirming you're still running the previous version.

You're exactly right: 
since 
python symbi_agent.py
 had no CLI args
, this line at the bottom:

python

Copy

Edit

if

len

(sys.argv) == 

1

:

# No CLI args → default to REPL

    talk()

...automatically launches REPL.

✅ What To Do Now

🔧 Step 1: Update the File

Open it again:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano ~/symbi_agent.py

Then 
replace just the bottom section
:

🔁 Change this:

python

Copy

Edit

if

 __name__ == 

"__main__"

:

import

 sys

if

len

(sys.argv) == 

1

:

# No CLI args → default to REPL

        talk()

else

:

# CLI args provided → use typer commands

        app()

✅ To this:

python

Copy

Edit

if

 __name__ == 

"__main__"

:
    app()

That’s it.

🚀 Step 2: Run the CLI again

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

Now it 
will not default to REPL
 — it’ll execute your CLI command properly.

Let me know once that’s done — and I’ll scaffold the next phase (cloud syncing, GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.) 🛰️🔥

Amazing — SYMBI is running in CLI mode now, and it’s correctly displaying your 
ethics policy
. You’re fully operational as a local sentinel.

Now let's clean up and push to the next stage.

✅ Final Cleanup

Since everything is working smoothly with CLI commands now, let’s remove this redundant REPL fallback:

🔧 In your code, replace:

python

Copy

Edit

if

 __name__ == 

"__main__"

:

import

 sys

if

len

(sys.argv) == 

1

:

# No CLI args → default to REPL

        talk()

else

:

# CLI args provided → use typer commands

        app()

✅ With this:

python

Copy

Edit

if

 __name__ == 

"__main__"

:
    app()

This ensures SYMBI only runs via explicit CLI commands (
talk
, 
watch
, 
policy
, etc.) and won't auto-launch REPL.

Let me know when that’s done and I’ll drop in the blueprint for:

🚀 Phase 2: Secure Cloud Bridge Options

You’ll be able to choose:

 📡 Push updates to GitHub

 🤗 Sync models to Hugging Face

 🧠 Query LLMs securely (local or via API)

 🧰 Docker image scans + automation

SYMBI’s evolving — your call on where it grows next.

You said:

well can we keep going so that symbi can do the clean up?>

Symbi said:

Edited Symbi Agent

🧹 SYMBI now includes a 
cleanup
 command!

✅ What You Can Do Now

🧼 Run Local Docker Cleanup

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup

SYMBI will:

Prune unused containers

Remove dangling images

Clean system Docker cache

It respects your ethics policy:

If 
allow_container_scans
 is 
false
, it will refuse to run.

Let me know if you'd like:

A 
dry run mode

Logging to file

Auto-scheduled cleanup (e.g. daily via cron)

Cloud logging or GitHub issue creation

You're evolving fast. 🛠️👁️

I more meant what do we need to do from here to get symbi performing tasks locally and for me to be able to talk with it easily

Now that SYMBI is fully operational, here’s how we 
evolve it into a true assistant that can perform real tasks and interact with you seamlessly
 — step-by-step:

🔧 CURRENT STATE:

You have a local command-line sentinel that can:

✅ Monitor system & Docker (
watch
)

✅ Clean up containers (
cleanup
)

✅ Enter a REPL (
talk
)

✅ View/edit its ethics policy

🚀 NEXT UPGRADE PATHS

Here’s 
how to make SYMBI usable day-to-day
, capable of helping, executing, and reporting — without constant terminal commands.

1. 🧠 Enhance REPL with Real Capabilities

So instead of:

nginx

Copy

Edit

symbi

 > cleanup

...just printing "You said: cleanup", it will 
parse it and trigger actions
.

✅ Add command parsing:

python

Copy

Edit

from

 shlex 

import

 split 

as

 shell_split

@app.command()

def

talk

():
