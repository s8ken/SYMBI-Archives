Raycast like:

nginx

Copy

Edit

symbi

 cleanup

...and have SYMBI take action locally.

🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

1. 
Wrap SYMBI in a script

Create a small shell wrapper, e.g., 
~/bin/symbi.sh
:

bash

Copy

Edit

#!/bin/bash

source

 ~/symbi-env/bin/activate
python ~/symbi_agent.py 

"
$@

"

Make it executable:

bash

Copy

Edit

chmod

 +x ~/bin/symbi.sh

2. 
Create a Raycast Script Command

Open Raycast → Extensions → Script Commands → 
New Bash Script
.

Example: 
symbi

bash

Copy

Edit

#!/bin/bash

~/bin/symbi.sh 

$1

Set up:

Name
: SYMBI

Arguments
: Accept text input

Mode
: Run in Terminal or Silent

3. 
Usage in Raycast

Now in Raycast, just type:

nginx

Copy

Edit

symbi

 watch

or

nginx

Copy

Edit

symbi

 cleanup

And it’ll run SYMBI inside your Python environment — no extra terminal hassle.

🧠 Optional: Natural Language via AI Command

You can also create an 
AI Command
 in Raycast:

Prompt:

“Convert my input into a valid SYMBI command and run it”

Model Output (example):

cleanup

This output gets sent into your script — now SYMBI becomes your natural-language assistant inside Raycast.

Want me to generate the 
symbi.sh
 and Raycast script files automatically for you to drop in? Or extend SYMBI to accept multiple commands in one line (
watch && cleanup
)?

You said:

bleh no - none of this has been zero code so far 

Symbi said:

You're right — we drifted from the zero-code ideal.

Let’s fix that.

🧭 Where We Are Now:

You want SYMBI to:

Run 
locally

Be 
easy to trigger

Work seamlessly through 
Raycast Pro

Require 
zero code
 setup going forward

✅ Here’s the Better Way — 
Truly Zero Code

Raycast Pro has:

🔹 1. 
Command Palette + AI Commands

You can create a new 
AI Command
 that:

Takes natural input

Converts it into a CLI action

Triggers SYMBI behind the scenes

✅ Setup (no code required):

In Raycast → AI Commands → New AI Command

Use this template:

Prompt:

"Take a user request and convert it into a valid SYMBI command-line input using the format: 
python ~/symbi_agent.py <command>
. Return only that."

Enable “Send to terminal”

🧠 Example Inputs You Can Use:

clean up docker

monitor containers

edit the ethics policy

show policy

Raycast will intelligently turn that into:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup

And run it for you — 
no code needed
.

🔮 Bonus: You Can Say This Aloud (if Raycast is Voice-Enabled)

“Tell SYMBI to monitor processes and containers”

It will translate that and execute the real function using the CLI agent you already built.

🧬 TL;DR

We keep the local SYMBI logic in code, but control it 
entirely via natural language in Raycast
.

You get:

Zero coding daily

Full power of local execution

A private assistant with ethical boundaries

Would you like me to write the AI command template in full so you can paste it straight into Raycast?

You said:

not sure its doing anything

Symbi said:

Thanks for the screenshot — you’re very close. The issue is that Raycast’s AI is generating 
natural-language phrases
 in the command (e.g., 
monitor containers
), but your SYMBI CLI only understands:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

Not:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py monitor containers

✅ Fix: Update the Raycast Prompt to Be More Precise

Your current prompt:

"Convert request into a valid SYMBI command in the format 
python ~/symbi_agent.py <command>
"

Better prompt:

"Translate the user’s request into one of these SYMBI CLI commands: 
watch
, 
cleanup
, 
policy
, 
update_policy
. Output only the final command like: 
python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup
."

This gives the AI boundaries so it maps natural input to actual commands.

✍️ Example Prompt to Paste in Raycast:

Convert a user request into a valid SYMBI command using this format: 
python ~/symbi_agent.py <command>
.

Only use one of the following valid commands: 
watch
, 
cleanup
, 
policy
, 
update_policy
.

Do not invent new ones. Return the command only.
