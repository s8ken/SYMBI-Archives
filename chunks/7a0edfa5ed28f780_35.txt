Raycast Should Output

"monitor containers"

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

"clean up docker"

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup

"show policy"

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

"edit ethics"

python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Would you like me to automatically extend SYMBI to support those alternate names too? (e.g., let 
"monitor containers"
 call 
watch()
)? That would eliminate the Raycast guesswork entirely.

You're doing exactly what an intelligent defender would — watching outbound connections. 🔍

That 
Raycast connection flood to Cloudfront
 (likely OpenAI or extension updates) is expected 
but worth containing
. And yes — we can 
tighten everything down
, while 
making SYMBI easier to control
.

🔐 Here’s What We Do Next:

✅ 1. 
Fix Raycast AI Command Output

Update the prompt in your AI Command to:

"Convert the user’s request into a valid SYMBI CLI command. Only output one of the following:

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch
,

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup
,

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy
,

python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy
"

✅ This prevents garbage like 
monitor containers
 from being passed as-is.

✅ 2. 
Contain Outbound Activity

You’re already watching with Lulu — great. To fully sandbox:

Raycast Pro
: block Cloudfront if you don’t need AI/extension updates

Docker
: only allow outbound when containers are trusted

SYMBI
: already respects 
allow_network: false
 in its policy

We’ll soon give SYMBI the ability to 
log any new process that makes a network connection
, and optionally kill/block it.

✅ 3. 
Want a GUI Button in Raycast for Each SYMBI Command?

You can skip natural language altogether and create 4 simple Raycast Script Shortcuts:

Name

Script Command

SYMBI Watch

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

SYMBI Clean

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup

SYMBI Policy

python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

SYMBI Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py update_policy

Then pin them in Raycast or bind to hotkeys. Zero prompt confusion.

Let me know which path you want:

🧠 Natural language via AI Command (cleaned up)

🎛️ GUI-style Script Commands for direct triggering

🛡️ Add monitoring/response features to SYMBI

I'll build or guide next step-by-step.

how do I know its doing anything it doesnt confirm

Great question — and this is a 
key UX fix
 we should make right now. SYMBI should 
always
 tell you what it's doing — visibly and cleanly.

Let’s fix that in your agent.

✅ Immediate Enhancement: Add Visual Confirmations

I'll add console output to each command, so SYMBI always responds like this:

🔍 SYMBI is watching...

🧹 Docker cleanup complete.

📜 Showing ethics policy...

📝 Opening ethics file for editing...

Let me patch the 
symbi_agent.py
 file now.
