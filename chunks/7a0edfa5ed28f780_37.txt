ptional)

python ~/symbi_agent.py talk
 lets you type natural input like:

watch

cleanup

exit

✅ Raycast Integration (in progress)

Raycast can:

Run SYMBI commands via AI or script

Accept natural phrases like "show policy"

Send them to terminal

Needs final tuning
: better AI prompt or static script buttons

✅ From Here — No More Code

You don’t need to write or paste code anymore. From now on, you’ll:

Task

Action

🔍 Monitor system

Ask Raycast: “watch system”

🧹 Clean Docker

Ask Raycast: “clean up containers”

📜 Check ethics

Say: “show policy”

🛠️ Edit settings

Say: “edit policy”

🔮 Extend SYMBI

Just tell me, and I’ll patch it

🧠 Would You Like to...

📼 Have SYMBI 
log what it sees
? (like process snapshots?)

📣 Get 
macOS pop-up alerts
 if it sees suspicious activity?

🧠 Run commands 
by voice through Raycast
?

🛰️ Sync activity summaries to GitHub or HuggingFace?

Just tell me what you want 
in plain language
, and I’ll do all the wiring.

Let’s keep it clean, voice-ready, and powerful — like you envisioned.

…is a direct 
Raycast AI Chat instance
, likely your current or recent session.

🔍 What It Does

This URL opens a 
specific context or thread
 inside the Raycast AI interface — useful if:

You want to reopen the session

You want to feed the output back to SYMBI

You want to connect 
Raycast AI’s output to your local agent

🧠 Next Moves: Zero-Code Integration

If you want to bridge Raycast AI to SYMBI cleanly, here’s the 
zero-code workflow
:

1. ✨ Use Raycast AI to output 
exact SYMBI commands

Set the AI prompt to:

"Translate requests into one of: 
watch
, 
cleanup
, 
policy
, or 
update_policy
. Output only the command."

Then it will return:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py watch

2. ⚡ Enable “Send to Terminal” in Raycast AI Command

This lets the output of the above command get 
run directly
 in your local terminal (triggering SYMBI).

✅ Net Result:

You type or say:

“Clean up Docker and show policy”

Raycast AI returns:

bash

Copy

Edit

python ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup && python ~/symbi_agent.py policy

And SYMBI runs it — no scripts, no manual typing.

Want me to craft the exact Raycast AI Command setup instructions, or generate a ready-to-import 
.raycast
 config?

the issue I have its its not like confirming or responding 

Symbi said:

Yes — that’s 
the
 core friction right now:

You're issuing commands via Raycast, but 
there's no clear confirmation or feedback
, making it feel like you’re talking into the void.

Let’s fix that cleanly and visually.

✅ Step-by-Step Fix: Give SYMBI a Voice in Raycast

🛠️ 1. Add Visual Output to SYMBI (already done ✅)

SYMBI already prints things like:

🔍 SYMBI is watching your system...

✅ Cleanup complete.

But if Raycast is set to 
“run in background”
, you’ll never see that output.

💡 2. Fix Raycast Script Command Settings

In Raycast:

Open the script command you're using for SYMBI

Set 
“Mode”
 to:

✅ 
Show in Raycast

or

✅ 
Run in Terminal

This ensures output appears in a visible window.

🧪 3. (Optional) Add a Mac Notification

If you want a system-level 
confirmation pop-up
, I can add this to SYMBI:

python

Copy

Edit

subprocess.run([

"osascript"

, 

"-e"

, 

'display notification "Cleanup complete" with title "SYMBI"'

])

That way, even background runs trigger a visible macOS notification.

🧬 TL;DR

Issue

Fix

SYMBI is silent in Raycast

Change script mode to “Show in Raycast” or “Terminal”

Still unclear

Add native macOS notification via 
osascript

Want full feedback

Enable logging or summary display

Would you like me to add those 
native notification lines
 to the agent so every action visibl
