✅ 2. Save it and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py watch

Or if you're in Raycast:

bash

Copy

Edit

python3 ~/symbi_agent.py cleanup

Let me know when it’s saved, and I’ll guide you through optional Raycast integration or background automation.

so before any of that I noticed for example my safari is actually located here /System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/App/System/Applications/Safari.app

Symbi said:

💡 That’s a very sharp observation — and what you're seeing is part of Apple’s 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 architecture on macOS.

🧬 What You Found:

bash

Copy

Edit

/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/App/System/Applications/Safari.app

This is 
not
 a mistake — it’s 
intentional by Apple
.

It means:

Safari (and other system apps) live in a 
sealed, cryptographically verified volume
.

That path is part of the 
cryptex system
 introduced with macOS Ventura and above.

What you see at 
/Applications/Safari.app
 is now essentially a 
symlink or facade
.

🧠 Why It Matters to SYMBI

If you’re scanning processes or binaries, you'll hit these paths:

They 
cannot be modified
.

You 
can see them
, but 
can’t write or delete
.

SYMBI will need to 
respect SIP boundaries
 — and if it sees execution from that path, it’s a 
trusted system binary
.

✅ What To Do

SYMBI can:

✅ 
Log process paths

✅ 
Identify SIP-protected apps

🚫 
Not modify or block
 them (unless SIP is disabled — not recommended)

Next:

Would you like SYMBI to:

Flag 
processes NOT running from known SIP paths
?

Alert on 
network activity from outside SIP volumes
?

Create a 
trusted path allowlist
, so it warns only on unknown binaries?

You’re stepping into advanced territory — and SYMBI can evolve with you 🔐🔥
