 scan them regularly with 
docker scout
, 
trivy
, or 
snyk
.

3. 
Stay Alert for Strange Artifacts

It’s reassuring this container was clearly part of Docker’s first-install test. But if you ever see other containers or images not tied to your work, 
dig deeper.
 It’s good practice.

Would you like help building a 
clean, secure container
 from scratch right now — maybe even one to serve SYMBI’s future frontend or API logic? 🔧🔥

You said:

why would they put it in the welcome container for training?

Symbi said:

💡 
Excellent question — and a very important one.

🤔 Why include a vulnerable base (
nginx:1-alpine-slim
) in the official welcome container?

The short answer is:

They didn’t mean to — it’s a side effect of "freezing" an old container for stability and demonstration purposes.

Let me break that down in detail:

🧪 1. 
The “Welcome to Docker” Container Isn’t Meant for Production

The 
docker/welcome-to-docker
 image is:

A 
training/demo container
 that runs once to verify Docker works.

Not updated regularly because it's meant to be 
a frozen, stable example
.

Meant for educational use, not deployment.

Unfortunately, that means it uses a 
static snapshot
 of an old image that 
accumulates CVEs
 over time, even if it was secure when published.

⚠️ 2. 
Using 
nginx:1-alpine-slim
 Was a Convenience Choice

They probably chose it because:

It was 
small, fast, and lightweight
, good for demos.

NGINX is familiar, so the output is easy to recognize.

Alpine is minimal, so it seemed ideal at the time.

But what they 
didn’t do
 is update it over the last 2 years. Now that:

Alpine 3.14/3.15
 (which this was likely based on) is 
EOL (End of Life)
,

New vulnerabilities keep getting found (as you saw in the CVE list),

The image appears insecure — even though it was originally clean.

🧩 3. 
Training vs. Security Tradeoff

From their perspective:

It’s just a hello-world demo container.

They don’t expect it to be exposed or reused.

But from a 
security perspective
, this creates confusion — especially for newcomers like you, because it gives the 
wrong impression
:

"Why is my first Docker image full of vulnerabilities?"

Answer: because it’s 
not maintained
. It's a 
snapshot
, not a model for production containers.

✅ What Should They Have Done?

Ideally, Docker should:

Use a base like 
scratch
 (empty container).

Avoid web servers or networking in the welcome container.

Auto-rebuild it every few months to refresh vulnerable packages.

Display a message: “
This image is not secure. Do not use in production.
”

🔒 What You Can Learn from This

You're already thinking like a systems builder. You spotted something most people ignore.

Let this be the first lesson in container security:

🧠 
Just because something is "official" doesn’t mean it’s secure.

From here, we can explore 
how to build your own hardened containers
, with:

Minimal base images (
scratch
, 
distroless
, etc.)

Auto-updated packages

Runtime security policies (e.g. seccomp, AppArmor, etc.)

Vulnerability scanning integrated in your pipeline

You said:

yeah well when I see this it looks like port 80 is exposed

Symbi said:

Yes — you’re exactly right.

🔍 That line:

nginx

Copy

Edit

EXPOSE

80

...
tells Docker to open port 80
 on the container. This means:

The container is 
configured to serve HTTP traffic
, usually via something like 
NGINX
, 
Apache
, or another web server.

It's a signal to any orchestration or networking tools (like 
docker run -p
, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes) that 
“this is the port you probably want to forward.”

⚠️ Important Clarification

EXPOSE does 
not
 automatically publish the port to the outside world.

Here’s the difference:

Command

What it does

EXPOSE 80
 (in Dockerfile)

Declares intent. Makes port 80 available 
within the container network
.

docker run -p 80:80

Actually publishes the port to your 
host
, making it accessible 
from outside
.
