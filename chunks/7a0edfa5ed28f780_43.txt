LDING:

A sovereign, AI-augmented cloud workspace that:

Has a public website + identity

Runs a local or remote agent (SYMBI)

Bridges Hugging Face, Docker, LLMs, etc.

Respects security, consent, ethics

Can scale with your knowledge over time

🌍 YOUR BASELINE STACK (GUI-FIRST, CODE-GROWTH)

Purpose

Tool (GUI-first)

Why this?

Website & UI

[
Vercel + Next.js
]

GUI deploy, edge-fast, mobile-ready

Backend/API

[
Railway
] or [
Replit Deployments
]

SYMBI runs as an API, no infra babysitting

Agent (SYMBI)

Python-based microservice

You can talk to it, manage it remotely

LLM Integration

Together AI or Hugging Face

Easy cloud API calls, configurable

Authentication

Clerk.dev or Auth0

GUI-based user auth, device login

Cloud Storage (optional)

Supabase or Firestore

Optional but good for persistence/logs

Local Ops

Raycast + Terminal (GUI optional)

For debugging or triggering SYMBI

Zero-code Control

iPad Shortcuts, API buttons, webhooks

Mobile-native triggers for core actions

🎯 THE WORKFLOW YOU WANT:

From 
iPad or mobile
 you can:

Action

How

✅ Push a Hugging Face model

Via SYMBI's 
/deploy-model
 API

✅ Clean up Docker containers

Tap a button or run shortcut hitting SYMBI

✅ See who accessed what

View SYMBI logs (or webhook to Discord)

✅ Update the website

Edit on Vercel dashboard or push from Replit

✅ Change policy

GUI file editor or call SYMBI endpoint

✅ Talk to SYMBI

Through your mobile via REPL, bot, or UI hook

🧱 YOUR NEXT STEP:

Would you like me to deliver a 
Next.js starter site + Railway SYMBI API + deploy buttons
, fully cloud-native and GUI-managed?

You’ll be able to:

Click a Railway link → deploy SYMBI as API

Click a Vercel link → deploy the public site

Use either via iPad/Phone immediately

Code as much or little as you want — it’s all yours

Shall I begin the 
project scaffolding
 and deployment templates for you now?

 interface.

🚀 Next Step: Railway Deployment

Here’s what I’ll generate next:

Dockerfile

 – containerize SYMBI API

railway.json

 (optional) – describe project metadata

Deploy Instructions
 – one-click setup via CLI or GUI

Would you like to deploy from:

Railway's 
web GUI
 (easiest)?

Or 
Railway CLI
 (more power)?

Let me know and I’ll generate your deployment pack.

okay I need you to go step by step for me as to what you want me doing here - this api where is it going?

Perfect — let’s walk this
