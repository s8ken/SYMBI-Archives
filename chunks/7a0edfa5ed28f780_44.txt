API on Railway
, so you can talk to it from anywhere.

🧱 Step 1: What You Just Got

✅ You now have a 
symbi_api.py
 — this is a 
FastAPI web service
 that wraps your SYMBI agent logic.

It supports:

GET /
 → test SYMBI is alive

GET /watch
 → list running processes

POST /cleanup
 → trigger Docker cleanup

GET /policy
 → show SYMBI’s ethics policy

POST /policy
 → update it remotely

SYMBI becomes a 
remote agent
 you can command via HTTP.

🗂 Step 2: Where Is It Going?

We are going to deploy it to 
Railway
 — a cloud platform that:

Hosts containerized web services

Gives you a public HTTPS endpoint (like 
https://symbi.up.railway.app
)

Handles all the infrastructure — no config files or DevOps needed

This means you’ll be able to 
trigger SYMBI from your browser, Raycast, iPad, or automation tools.

✅ Step 3: Your Actions Right Now

Here’s what you need to do — I'll walk with you:

1. Create a folder for deployment

bash

Copy

Edit

mkdir

 ~/symbi-cloud && 

cd

 ~/symbi-cloud

2. Download the agent code into that folder

Paste in 
symbi_api.py
 I just built (let me know if you'd like a downloadable link or I’ll guide you to copy-paste again).

3. Add a 
Dockerfile
 (I'll generate this next)

This tells Railway how to run your agent.

⏭️ What Happens Next

Once you have that folder ready, I’ll give you:

A 
Dockerfile

The Railway deployment steps

The actual deploy button/command

🔁 Your job is to 
only follow the step in front of you
. Ready for step 4 (Dockerfile)?

You said:

okay no you already have me entering code - I will start in railway where it is asking me where we are deploying the new project

Symbi said:

✅ Perfect. Let’s 
start from the Railway GUI
 — no code yet. You're on the right track.

🎛️ RAILWAY GUI DEPLOY — Step-by-Step

When Railway asks:

“Where is your code?”

You’ll see several options:

Option

What It Means

What You Choose

GitHub Repo

Deploy from a repo (you don’t want this)

❌ Not for now

Deploy from Template

Use a prebuilt example

❌ Not needed

Start Empty Project

Manual deploy (what we want)

✅ YES — Choose this

✅ Step 1: Click “
Start Empty Project
”

Railway will now open your project dashboard with nothing inside yet. This is where we will 
connect your code
 next.

✳️ You should now see:

A blank project

Tabs like:

Deployments

Settings

Plugins

That means you’re ready to 
connect code manually.

🔄 Step 2: Add a Service

You’ll now:

Click the 
New
 or 
Add
 button

Choose 
“Deploy from Dockerfile”

(If asked for repo or CLI, we’ll use the 
Railway CLI
 to deploy local code next — very easy.)

👉 Before we continue:

Are you in the 
empty project dashboard
 now?

Do you see the 
option to deploy from CLI or Dockerfile
?

If so, we’ll install the CLI and push SYMBI up. Shall we continue?

You said:

yes I am in the empty project dashboard and want to ensure I am using docker cloud. in railway it has docker image as an option

Symbi said:

💯 Perfect — you’re in exactly the right spot.

✅ Your Decision: 
“Docker Image” Option in Railway

That option expects:

A 
public Docker image
 from a registry (like Docker Hub)

OR a private one with auth tokens

But: you don’t have a SYMBI Docker image 
yet
 — it’s 
on your local machine
 as raw Python.

🧠 So You Have Two Paths:

🔹 Option A: “Docker Image”

You’d:

Manually 
build the SYMBI Docker image

Push it to Docker Hub

Paste that image name in Railway

⬇️ Requires:

Docker installed locally

Docker Hub account

CLI use (once)

✅ 
Recommended if you want long-term reusability and full control

🔹 Option B: Use Railway CLI to deploy from local folder

You’d:

Build and deploy 
directly from your machine

No Docker Hub required

Railway handles the containerization

⬇️ Requires:

Railway CLI installed (1 command)

You run 
railway up
 from project folder

✅ 
Easiest for now if you don’t want to use Docker Hub

🚀 My Recommendation

Let’s use 
Railway CLI
 for now — fastest, least friction.

✅ NEXT STEP: Install Railway CLI

In your ter
