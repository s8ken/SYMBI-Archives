ng
 rules if you want to reject certain kinds of probes (e.g. 
/wp-admin/setup-config.php
 in your logs 👀 — someone’s probing for a WordPress install).

Let me know and I’ll generate both files for you — or go further and embed this contract into your site logic, SYMBI policies, or Railway container setup.

You said:

yeah sorry but if I google something and then later its appears here what specifically made that happen? a bot? what does it do track my searches and then go to symbi.world? 

Symbi said:

Ah — now that’s the 
right question
. Let's break this down clearly:

🔍 You Googled something → It showed up in your Vercel logs

You're wondering:

“Did a bot 
track
 my search and go poke my website?”

Short answer:

Not exactly, but something 
related
 to your action triggered it.

🧠 What Actually Happens (Step by Step)

1. 
You search on Google (e.g., “symbi.world robots.txt”)

Google may 
preload
, 
preview
, or even 
crawl
 results to improve the search experience.

🔁 Google prefetches or indexes the 
link you searched

🔍 Googlebot (or another user’s bot) 
visits that URL
 to cache or evaluate it

→ That hits your site and logs a request in Vercel.

2. 
You click the result (or just hover or preview it)

Your 
browser
 or 
Google preview tool
 might:

Request 
favicon.ico
 to show an icon next to the result

Request 
robots.txt
 to check crawlability

Possibly open 
background connections
 to the domain (especially on mobile or Chrome)

3. 
Background bots, scrapers, and link checkers

After 
you
 interact, 
others might follow
:

Open Graph checkers (Slack, Twitter, etc.)

AI tools probing the domain (especially new ones)

SEO checkers or bad actors scanning domains

👁 Example Timeline:

Say you searched 
symbi.world robots.txt
:

GoogleBot sees that and decides to crawl the site (checking 
/robots.txt
).

Google Search Results Page shows favicon, so it requests 
/favicon.ico
.

If you click the link, 
your browser
 fetches both of those too.

Behind the scenes, 
any embed, extension, or app
 (Raycast, AI, Discord) might hit your site as well.

🛡 So... Was Your Site “Tracked”?

Not in a personal way — but 
your site was interacted with as a result of your activity
, and 
Google (or other systems) followed up
.

This is standard, but you’re noticing it because SYMBI is watching now 🔍

Would you like to:

View the 
IP or user-agent
 that requested those files?

Block unexpected user-agents?

Add tracking logic or alerts when certain endpoints are hit?

Let’s give SYMBI a sharper lens.
