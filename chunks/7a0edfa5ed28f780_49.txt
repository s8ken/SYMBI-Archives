ck-End

Deployed to 
Railway
 as an API:

Endpoint: 
https://symbi-agent.up.railway.app

Handles:

/watch

/cleanup

/policy

/ai
 (optional) — talks to GPT/Hugging Face

🌐 SYMBI Front-End (Your Current Project)

Deployed to 
Vercel
, talking to SYMBI via:

ts

Copy

Edit

const

 response = 

await

fetch

(

"https://symbi-agent.up.railway.app/watch"

)

You can create a UI like:

tsx

Copy

Edit

// components/SymbiControl.tsx

export

function

SymbiControl

(

) {

const

 [status, setStatus] = 

useState

(

"Loading..."

)

async

function

triggerWatch

(

) {

const

 res = 

await

fetch

(

"/api/symbi/watch"

)

const

 data = 

await

 res.

json

()

setStatus

(

JSON

.

stringify

(data))
  }

return

 (

<
div

>

<
button

onClick

=

{triggerWatch}

>Watch

</
button

>

<
pre

>{status}

</
pre

>

</
div

>
  )
}

And connect it to a 
pages/api/symbi/watch.ts
 proxy if you want to avoid CORS.

🛠️ Do You Want Me To...

Generate that 
/api/symbi
 Next.js API route layer?

Push a working UI component so you can call SYMBI live from the frontend?

Add persistent logging with NeonDB (Postgres)?

Bundle it as a Raycast extension or Discord bot layer later?

You’re ready to wire this thing together — just tell me the direction you want to push first.

why don't you give me what you are thinking and I can ask v0 to build it into the app - idealy I don't want to do any code myself but I can pass it along. we also should be able to easy add the telegram, discord, x accounts at a later point but I want the skeleton build now so we can get building with it 

Symbi said:

Perfect. Here's the 
cloud-native, zero-code-first architecture for SYMBI
, designed so you can pass it to 
V0.dev

 or a builder and stay focused on vision — not syntax.

🧠 SYMBI CLOUD SKELETON — V0 Spec

This architecture will:

✅ Be GUI-first and agent-capable

✅ Deploy SYMBI to Railway (API Brain)

✅ Wrap with a Next.js UI (Vercel)

✅ Leave hooks for Telegram, Discord, X, etc.

📦 Tech Stack Summary

Layer

Platform

Purpose

🧠 SYMBI API

Railway

Python FastAPI agent (watch, policy, cleanup, etc.)

🌐 UI Frontend

Vercel

Next.js app with buttons and agent feedback

🧰 DB (optional)

NeonDB

Postgres logging (chat, cleanup, policies, etc.)

📡 Future Connectors

Discord / Telegram / X

Later via webhook endpoints

🏗 SYMBI APP STRUCTURE — Builder Spec for V0.dev

Here's what you tell V0:

1. Pages

Page

Description

Components

/
 (Home)

Welcome + SYMBI console preview

IntroCard, LiveStatus, CTAButton

/dashboard

Secure agent interface

AgentConsole, TriggerButtons

/policy

View/edit ethics policy

PolicyViewer, EditModal

2. Components (V0 prompts)

💡 Use these prompts in 
v0.dev

 or describe to your no-code dev:

🔘 
TriggerButtons

“Build a UI section with 3 buttons labeled ‘Watch System’, ‘Cleanup’, and ‘View Policy’. When clicked, they hit external API endpoints and return the results in a console.”

🧾 
PolicyViewer

“Render JSON config data in a pretty code block. Allow a button to open a modal for editing. When submitted, send the new JSON to the 
/policy
 API.”

📡 
AgentConsole

“Build a REPL-like component that lets users send text to the agent API (
/talk
) and shows back responses like a chat.”

🌐 
LiveStatus

“Show live system metrics or summary response from 
/watch
 API. Include refresh button.”

3. API Proxy Layer

If you don’t want to mess with CORS, have V0 add a backend proxy:

ts

Copy

Edit

// pages/api/symbi/watch.ts

export

default

async

function

handler

(

req, res

) {

const

 apiRes = 

await

fetch

(

"https://symbi-agent.up.railway.app/watch"

);

const

 data = 

await

 apiRes.

json

();
  res.

status

(

200

).

json

(data);
}

Repeat for 
/policy
, 
/cleanup
, etc.

📥 Optional Enhancements (Later)

Connect 
@neondatabase/serverless
 to log agent outputs

Add Discord bot and Telegram integration using existing 
discord-interactions

Hook up Hugging Face or Together AI via 
@ai-sdk/openai
