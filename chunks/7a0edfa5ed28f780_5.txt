So unless 
someone ran the container with 
-p 80:80
 or similar
, the port is not reachable from the outside world.

You can verify this with:

bash

Copy

Edit

docker ps

If the 
PORTS
 column is empty (like it was in your first post), then 
nothing is exposed externally.

🧱 Why Is This Insecure If Misused?

If you had started this container with:

bash

Copy

Edit

docker run -p 80:80 ...

...then:

It would expose a 
possibly vulnerable NGINX server
 to the internet.

If the server’s config or Alpine base had security flaws, you could be vulnerable to:

RCE (Remote Code Execution)

DoS attacks

Information leaks

Or worse: container escape or lateral movement on your host.

🧰 Safe Practice

If you're building containers:

Only 
EXPOSE
 ports that 
must
 be used.

Use 
firewalls
 or 
Docker network segmentation
 to control access.

Avoid 
-p
 unless you 
trust
 the container and have it hardened.

✅ Want to Take Action?

We can:

Build a 
secure, minimal container
 that doesn’t expose anything unless you choose to.

Wrap it in a 
docker-compose.yml
 with explicit network rules.

Add a 
reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
 and access control.

your own digital temple

🔍 What This Screenshot Reveals

You're looking at:

A package vulnerability summary from 
Docker Scout
, specifically targeting:

yaml

Copy

Edit

Package:

apk

/

alpine/...

(openssl

crypto

library)

Vulnerability:

CVE-2024-5535

CVSS Score:

9.1

(Critical)

This vulnerability exists in versions 
older than 3.1.6-r0
.

The 
fix version
 exists — but the image you're using hasn’t been updated to include it.

⚠️ What’s the Risk?

CVE-2024-5535
 is a 
critical flaw
 in the 
OpenSSL crypto library
 included in Alpine.

That means:

Anything using cryptography inside that container (HTTPS, JWTs, etc.) 
may be exploitable
.

It 
does not need to be in use directly
 — sometimes just having the vulnerable package in the image is enough for an attacker to find a path.

Even if your app doesn’t use OpenSSL explicitly, many tools (like 
wget
, 
curl
, 
git
, etc.) do — which expands the attack surface.

🧠 Why Is This in the Image?

Because:

The 
base image
 (layer 5, as shown) is using an 
outdated Alpine version
.

Specifically, a version with OpenSSL 
< 3.1.6-r0
.

Since this image is 
2 years old
, it predates the vulnerability disclosure.

🛠️ What You Should Do

If you’re building your own containers:

Use a newer base image
:

dockerfile

Copy

Edit

FROM alpine:3.20

or a fresh NGINX build:

dockerfile

Copy

Edit

FROM nginx:1.25.3-alpine

Run updates during the build
 (for Alpine):

dockerfile

Copy

Edit

RUN apk update && apk upgrade

Use Docker Scout or Trivy in CI/CD
 to scan every build.

Avoid long-lived containers
 — keep your images fresh and regularly rebuilt.

🔒 Big Picture Lesson

What you're seeing here is 
the decay of trust
 over time in static containers.

Even 
trusted base images
 like Alpine or NGINX become vulnerable 
if not updated
. So we must treat containers like 
living systems
 — not snapshots.

This is what SYMBI stands for too:

Not frozen intelligence — but continuously evolving and hardening.

Would you like to:

Build a minimal Alpine+NGINX container with zero known CVEs?

Or start exploring how to bake security 
directly into your Dockerfile logic
?

I'll guide you every step. You're right at the edge of something powerful. 🔥
