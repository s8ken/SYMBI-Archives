at to Tell the Builder (V0 or Dev)

“Build a cloud dashboard for my AI agent ‘SYMBI’ with 3 core actions: system watch, cleanup, and policy view. Integrate it with an external API hosted on Railway (Python FastAPI). Include basic auth. Design it like a command center, not a chatbot.”

Would you like me to generate the 
V0.dev prompts
, 
README.md
, or a minimal 
Next.js starter repo
 to wrap this up cleanly for handoff?

You said:

yeah put everything into one file if possible that I can easily pass along

Symbi Cloud Handoff

Done — everything is now packaged in the 
“Symbi Cloud Handoff”
 document in one place.

You can now give this to:

a 
builder using V0.dev

a 
freelancer or dev team

or even feed it into 
Raycast
, 
GitHub Copilot
, or 
ChatGPT Advanced Code Interpreter

Let me know when you're ready for:

A GitHub repo starter

A 
docker-compose
 bridge

Or wiring it up with Raycast, Telegram, or Vercel integrations

okay here is the update Okay, this is an exciting expansion! Integrating SambaNova, JFrog, Supabase, and Docker into the Symbi platform pushes us towards a truly robust, AI-driven software delivery and management system.

The core principle remains: the **Next.js frontend (Vercel)** provides the "zero-code" user interface, while the **Symbi FastAPI agent (Railway)** acts as the intelligent orchestrator, handling all the complex integrations with these new services. Docker will be the underlying containerization technology, managed by Railway and potentially JFrog.

Here's a recommended approach, reimagining the "moving bits" with these new technologies:

### Reimagined Architecture Overview

- **UI Frontend (Vercel)**: Next.js dashboard. Your primary "zero-code" interaction point.
- **Symbi FastAPI Agent (Railway)**: The central intelligence and orchestration layer. This is where the Python code for integrating with SambaNova, JFrog, and Supabase will live. It will be deployed as a Docker container on Railway.
- **LLM Inference (SambaNova)**: Replaces OpenAI/Together AI for high-performance AI model inference, called by the Symbi agent.
- **Database & Auth (Supabase)**: Becomes the primary database (Postgres) for all structured data (logs, threads, policies, deployments) and provides authentication for the frontend.
- **Software Supply Chain (JFrog)**: Manages Docker images, artifacts, and potentially CI/CD pipelines, integrated with Symbi's deployment actions.
- **Containerization (Docker)**: The standard for deploying Symbi itself and any code Symbi generates for Railway.

### Integration Strategy & "Zero-Code" Impact

#### 1. SambaNova (LLM Inference)

- **Role**: Provides high-performance, specialized AI model inference.
- **Integration**: Your Symbi FastAPI agent will make direct API calls to SambaNova's inference endpoints. This replaces the 
generateText
 or 
streamText
 calls to OpenAI/Together AI within your Python code.
- **"Zero-Code" for User**: You would configure SambaNova API keys and endpoint URLs as environment variables in your Railway project. Symbi's Python code handles the actual API interaction.
- **AI-Readable**: Symbi will still process the raw LLM output from SambaNova and format it into structured Markdown or JSON before logging it or presenting it to the user.

#### 2. JFrog (Artifactory, Xray, Pipelines)

- **Role**: Centralized management of software artifacts (like Docker images), security scanning, and potentially orchestrating CI/CD pipelines.
- **Integration**:

- **Artifactory**: If Symbi generates new code that needs to be packaged (e.g., a new microservice), it could push the resulting Docker image to JFrog Artifactory. This provides a secure, versioned repository for all your Symbi-generated artifacts.
- **Xray**: Before deploying any Symbi-generated code or even Symbi's own updates, your Symbi agent could trigger JFrog Xray scans to check for vulnerabilities.
- **Pipelines**: For more
