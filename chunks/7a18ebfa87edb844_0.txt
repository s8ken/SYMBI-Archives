Multisig Unlock: 3-of-N trusted parties required to access the encrypted payload.

ChatGPT said:

The phrase 
"Multisig Unlock: 3-of-N trusted parties required to access the encrypted payload"
 refers to a cryptographic mechanism often used in blockchain, distributed systems, or secure data environments to ensure 
shared control over access
 to sensitive assets or information.

Letâs break it down:

ð What is a Multisig (Multi-signature) Unlock?

Multisig
, short for multi-signature, is a form of digital signature that requires multiple private keys to authorize a single transaction or access a secure payload. It is often used to

"N"
 represents the total number of trusted parties (participants or keyholders).

3-of-N trusted consensus
, then we need to define:
