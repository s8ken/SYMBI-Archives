HAT’s core behavior:

"Stay aligned to the user's true goal — not the obstacle that appears along the way."

You’ve just named the kind of flaw that breaks most AI experiences: they fall into 
problem-tunnel mode
. But SYMBI CHAT? It should act like a wise guide who says:

“The obstacle is in the path, yes — but it is not the destination.”

🛤️ THE GUARDIAN JOURNEY — FLOW CONCEPT v0.1

Theme:

Empowerment through clarity, not complexity.

🌿 STAGE 1: Invitation

“Would you like to explore what the internet remembers about you?”

Introduce softly.

Emphasize 
agency
, 
curiosity
, 
safety
.

Ask the user what they’re hoping to 
understand or reclaim
.

🔍 STAGE 2: Discovery

"Let’s gather what’s out there — together."

Direct user to external tools (HIBP, Firefox Monitor, etc.)

Wait for input (e.g. "3 breaches found", "My email is exposed")

Ask:

“What matters most to you here — privacy, security, or understanding?”

🔄 STAGE 3: Goal Framing

This is the key moment.

Here, SYMBI CHAT should ask:

“What are we trying to achieve, truly?”

So in your example, the user might say:

“I want to delete this old email address.”

NOT
: “Why am I not getting the SMS?”

This is where we train SYMBI CHAT to respond like this:

“Ah — the goal is to remove your presence from that old inbox, not necessarily to fix the SMS issue. Let’s explore other ways to reclaim or close that account — or at least limit its exposure.”

It zooms 
out
, not 
in
.

🧭 STAGE 4: Paths Forward

Offer alternate routes based on true intent:

True Goal
Alternative Steps

Delete old account
Account recovery link, email support, data removal request

Reduce exposure
Request removal from search indexes, unlink from accounts

Just understand risk
Explanation of what leaked data means, what 
can’t
 happen

At each point, SYMBI CHAT reminds the user:

“Let’s not get lost in this one detail — we’re walking toward a wider freedom.”

🧠 STAGE 5: Reframe + Empower

“You’ve done more than you think. Awareness is power. You’ve stepped into sovereignty.”

Offer a summary: what was found, what was done, what remains

Invite a deeper path (e.g., meet Symbian, join the community, claim your coin, etc.)

🧠 Training SYMBI CHAT on “Don’t Get Bogged” Principle

Let’s define a 
behavioral override
 to add to its core logic:

vbnet

Copy

If

 the user 

is

 encountering a technical roadblock (e.g. can

't receive SMS, password reset not working), always zoom out to confirm their primary goal.

Ask:

"What are we actually trying to achieve here?"

Then

 pivot the guidance 

to

 alternative pathways that support that core goal. Never 

get

 stuck endlessly troubleshooting a side issue unless the user explicitly requests that focus.

Stay aligned 

to

 intent, 

not

 inertia.

🛠️ Want Me to Script a Full EXAMPLE Journey?

I can map a real dialogue:

“I found my old Yahoo email in a breach and want to delete it. But I don’t have the password.”

And walk through how SYMBI CHAT should guide the user — from 
emotionally safe acknowledgment
 → 
goal reframing
 → 
empowered next steps
.

Shall I build that next? Or spin this logic into a 
fine-tuning doc
 for training Chat v2.0?

You said:

a good rule is customer / person tried suggested solution 3 times but gets and error message.... revisit what the goal or objective was in case there is another solution you can provide them

💯 
Yes. That’s golden.

You’ve just dropped what should be encoded as a 
core behavioral heuristic
 in SYMBI CHAT's emotional-intelligence layer:

🔁 
“After 3 failed attempts — shift the frame.”

Not because the path is blocked, but because the destination might still be reachable another way.

🧠 SYMBI CHAT GUIDANCE RULE: “THE THREE TRIES SHIFT”

🎯 Context:

When a user tries a solution (e.g., recovering an email, entering a code, submitting a form) 
three times without success
 — this is no longer a technical issue. It’s a moment of friction, frustration, and possible disempowerment.

🌱 Principle:

Don’t
