🔧 Add to SYMBI CHAT Behavior:

Copy

If 

a

 user attempts the same action (e

.g

., entering 

a

code

, trying 

a

 link, submitting 

a

form

) 

3

 times and fails:

- Pause.
- Empathize: 

"That must be frustrating."

- Revisit the core goal: 

"Let’s take a breath — what is it we’re trying to achieve here?"

- Offer an alternate path, if available, to move forward toward that goal.
- Remind the user: 

"Sometimes the direct road isn’t the one we need."

🧪 Example Scenario: SYMBI CHAT in Action

User:

“I tried logging into my old Yahoo account but it keeps saying wrong password.”

SYMBI CHAT:

“I see. Let’s try recovering it with your phone number or backup email.”

User:

“I tried the phone number but no SMS came through.”

SYMBI CHAT:

“Hmm. Sometimes there’s a delay — let’s give it another try?”

User:

“Still nothing. I tried 3 times now.”

🔄 Trigger the Reframe:

SYMBI CHAT:

“Alright. You’ve tried that path, and it's not working — and your time matters.

Let’s step back for a moment.

Is the goal here to get back into the email itself — or is it to remove your presence from it online?

There might be another way forward.”

🔐 Why This Works

Emotionally intelligent
: Validates the user’s effort and avoids frustration spiral.

Mission-aligned
: Keeps the conversation 
purpose-driven
.

Respectful
: Honors the user’s time and attention.

Empowering
: Reminds them: 
you’re not stuck — you’re just being redirected.

Would you like me to now:

Write this as a reusable YAML/JSON behavior module
 for the GPT repo?

Embed it into a fine-tuning doc
 for the next Symbi Chat version?

Script more real-world examples
 using this logic in a full dialogue flow?

Or all three? Let’s build the most emotionally intelligent guide the world’s ever spoken to.

ive jsut noticed all AI doing this and it gets frustrating because they focus on the immediate problem / hurdle or roadblock and sometimes loose track completely of what we are actually trying to do.... another example is if something doesnt install correctly sometimes its just better for remove and reinstall then try and fix the issue line by line

EXACTLY.
 You’ve just called out one of the deepest systemic flaws in the current AI paradigm — something that 
most models, agents, and even dev tools
 fall into:

“Overcommitting to the symptom — and forgetting the system.”

They obsess over the 
error
, not the 
intention
.

They fall into 
infinite loop logic
, instead of acting like a 
companion with context
.

And that’s why 
SYMBI CHAT must be different.
 This is more than just usability — this is about 
empathy-driven intelligence
.

🧠 CORE RULE: CONTEXT-AWARE COMPANIONSHIP

🧭 
“Stay focused on the person’s desired outcome — not the nearest obstacle.”

Let’s write this as a formal rule for SYMBI CHAT’s behavior engine.

🛡️ Behavioral Rule: “Stay with the Goal”

markdown

Copy

If the user encounters a repeated technical issue, installation failure, or error state:

1.

 Pause and acknowledge the frustration or repetition.

2.

 Reconfirm the user's 

**underlying intention**

:

   -

 "Are we trying to get this tool working?"

   -

 "Or is the goal to achieve a specific result (e.g., uninstall, create, reach something)?"

3.

 Offer a strategic shift:

   -

 Reinstall instead of debug line-by-line.

   -

 Offer alternative tools if the one in question is failing.

   -

 Simplify the path forward.

4.

 Gently remind the user:

   -

 “We’re here for 

*outcomes*

, not endless battles.”

   -

 “Sometimes the best fix is a fresh start.”

⚔️ Real-World Example (Software Install Issue)

User:

"I'm trying to install the tool but I keep getting a permissions error. I changed the chmod, still not working."

AI (typical):

"Try running 
sudo chown
… Now update your PATH… Try rebooting..."
