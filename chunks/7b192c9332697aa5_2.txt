suite?

Let’s help you determine whether 
you installed GPG Suite
 (intentionally or as a dependency). Here are a few ways you can check right now:

🔎 1. 
Check for GPGTools Files

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to see if the GPG Suite directories exist:

bash

Copy

ls

 /Applications | grep -i gpg

or

bash

Copy

ls

 /Library/Application\ Support/GPGTools

If the second one exists, 
GPG Suite was installed
 at some point — either manually or by another app that uses it (like Git, 
pass
, or encryption tools).

📦 2. 
List Installed Packages (Homebrew or System)

Check if it was installed via 
Homebrew
:

bash

Copy

brew list | grep -i gpg

Or for the standard GPGTools package:

bash

Copy

pkgutil --pkgs | grep -i gpgtools

If you see something like:

Copy

org.gpgtools.gpgmail
org.gpgtools.gpgsuite

Then yes — 
GPG Suite was installed via installer package
.

🧠 3. 
Possible Reasons It Was Installed

You (or a dev tool) may have installed it if:

You use 
Git
 with commit signing (
git config --global user.signingkey
).

You’ve used 
encrypted email
 (e.g., with Mail.app + GPGMail).

You work with 

pass

, the UNIX password manager.

You installed 
Keybase
, 
Sequoia
, or other crypto/dev tools that bundle GPG.

📁 4. 
Look for Your GPG Keyring

If you want to go deeper, check for the GPG home folder:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~/.gnupg

If it exists and has files like 
pubring.kbx
, 
trustdb.gpg
, or 
private-keys-v1.d
, then GPG has been used on your system — whether by you directly or via another tool.

If you'd like, I can help walk through cleaning it up or deciding whether to keep it. Or we can trace when it first appeared using logs. Just say the word. 🕵️‍♂️

would that have been done as part of building the symbi.world site?

Excellent question — let’s walk through whether 
building the 
symbi.world
 site
 could’ve led to the installation of 
GPG Suite
 (or just 
GPG
 tools in general).

🔧 Was GPG Suite Likely Installed During SYMBI Site Development?

Short answer: Not by default — but it's 
possible
 if your workflow included certain tools.

Here's when GPG 
could
 have been pulled in:

Scenario
GPG Likely Used?
Explanation

You signed Git commits
✅ Likely
Some devs sign commits with GPG for added security. Tools like 
git commit -S
 or GitHub verification rely on GPG keys.

You used a framework/tool that signs packages (e.g., npm, pnpm, homebrew)
⚠️ Possible
Some dev tools or CLI frameworks (like 
pnpm
, 
brew
, 
cargo
, etc.) will optionally use GPG to verify packages.

You used encrypted credentials / secret management (e.g., 
sops
, 
pass
)
✅ Likely
GPG is a core part of secret management tools.

You installed something like 
Keybase
, 
Homebrew
, or a developer-focused toolchain
⚠️ Possible
Some of these will install GPG or suggest you do so.

You manually installed GPG Suite from 
gpgtools.org

✅ Yes
That would install the full suite including 
fixGpgHome
.

🧠 How You Can Tell if It Was SYMBI-Related

Run this to check when the 
fixGpgHome
 binary was created:

bash

Copy

stat

 /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/fixGpgHome

Look for the 
Birth:
 or 
Created:
 timestamp. If it lines up with when you were actively building or setting up the SYMBI site — that’s your clue.

Also, check your Git config:

bash

Copy

git config --global user.signingkey

If that’s set, and your commits are signed, GPG may have been installed during that process.

🔐 Verdict

If your SYMBI site build used standard tools like Next.js, React, Vercel, or Netlify without any cryptographic tooling — 
you probably didn’t need GPG Suite
.

But if you signed commits, encrypted secrets, or used security-focused tooling… it’s very plausible it got pulled in either by you or one of your tools.

Want me to help scan for signs of commit signing or encryption tooling in your SYMBI site repo? Or help clean out GPG if it’s no longer needed? Just say the word.
