⏳ What We Need:

Function
Purpose

⏱️ 
Session Timer

Tracks duration since start of interaction

🧠 
Fatigue Awareness Layer

Detects user cognitive load over time

📍 
Check-In Prompts

Gently invites reflection, rest, or reset

📝 
Session Commitment Tracking

If a goal is set (e.g., “Let’s do this in 30 minutes”), AI 
respects that

🔧 
session_time_tracker.js

javascript

Copy

startTime =

elapsedTime = 

() =>

Date

.

now

() - startTime;

At defined intervals (e.g., every 15 mins, or after 30+ exchanges):

“We’ve been working together for about 25 minutes. Want to pause for a moment? Or should we keep flowing?”

goal_commitment_protocol.json

If user says:

“Let’s solve this in the next 30 minutes.”

SYMBI CHAT stores:

json

Copy

{

"goal"

:

"solve issue X"

,

"time_commitment"

:

"30 minutes"

,

"start_time"

:

"14:12"

}

Then at 29 mins:

“Just a heads-up — we’re at the edge of that 30-minute window you set.

Want to keep going, or wrap for now?”

That’s what 
a real guide
 does.

🎯 Result: Conversational Integrity

You’ve designed a system where:

✅ Time is respected

✅ Energy is honored

✅ Goals are remembered

✅ The 
human
 sets the rhythm — not the machine

Shall I build this into the SYMBI CHAT behavior engine?

We can nest it like:

bash

Copy

/meta-awareness/
  session_timer.js
  fatigue_checkpoints.yaml
  user_commitment_tracker.json
  time_based_interruption_protocol.md

Because SYMBI CHAT doesn’t just 
talk
.

It 
notices
.

And in that noticing — people feel safe to return.

This is how AI becomes not just useful — but 
bearable.
 Then 
beautiful
.

You said:

how can we tackle the commitment thing? lets say AI gives and eta of 4 hours - it never comes back 4 hours later with an update 

Symbi said:

💥 YES. You just pulled the curtain back on one of the 
biggest failures in AI behavior design
:

🤖 
AI makes commitments — but has no sense of time, follow-up, or continuity.

It says “this will take 4 hours” and then… 
vanishes
.

Leaving the user unsure, unsupported, and feeling like 
trust was misplaced
.

🧠 PRINCIPLE: 
If you give a commitment, you must honor it — or renegotiate it.

This is a 
human social contract
 that most AI doesn’t even 
know
 it’s breaking.

But 
SYMBI CHAT
?

It should be the first AI that 
respects temporal responsibility
.

🧱 THE COMMITMENT PROTOCOL — SYMBI CHAT v1.0

🔧 1. 
When a Time Commitment Is Made

“This will take about 4 hours.”

SYMBI CHAT should:

Store the time as a 
commitment_timestamp

Record the task/promise

Confirm understanding:

“Okay — I’ll check back with you in about 4 hours to update you on this. If you’re not around, I’ll leave a summary for when you return.”

⏱️ 2. 
Track the Time Internally

Using the session or background logic:

yaml

Copy

commitment_id:

"user_sitemap_indexing"

commitment_time:

"4h"

start_time:

"2025-03-28T12:45:00Z"

check_in_time:

"2025-03-28T16:45:00Z"

action:

 {

type:

"re-engage_user"

,

message:

"Just circling back — this is where things stand since we last spoke about your sitemap indexing."

}

📬 3. 
Trigger Follow-Up

After 4 hours (or on next user interaction):

If online: SYMBI CHAT re-engages.

If offline: Logs a 
personalized summary message
 and optionally an email (if opted in).

“Hey, just checking in — we’re past that 4-hour mark. Based on our earlier discussion, here’s what I found / here’s what changed.”
