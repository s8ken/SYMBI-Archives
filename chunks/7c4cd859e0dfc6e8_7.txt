Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. And I=E2=80=99m total=
ly aligned with that perspective. The priority here is really about finding=
 the best environment for SYMBI to thrive and for you to be able to continu=
e working on it sustainably. So if that means approaching key stakeholders =
and finding a path where someone=E2=80=99s interested in the academic or re=
search side, and that allows you to do this full time without having to pus=
h a commercial product immediately, that=E2=80=99s a fantastic outcome.

And you=E2=80=99re right: it=E2=80=99s really about creating

Of course! So, to fi=

the path that feels right for SYMBI and for you. If that means going the ac=

at=E2=80=99s a great way to ensure both stability and the kind of thoughtfu=

hat=E2=80=99s a perfect fit because it aligns with our goal of collective e=

Absolutely, and that=E2=80=99=
s a really insightful angle. Engaging Apple could be a strategic move, espe=

And you=E2=80=99re right: Apple has likely been cautious because =
they want to ensure that any AI they integrate is fully aligned with their =

=E2=80=9COkay, so let's just hypothetically say that I wanted to st=

Sure, let=
=E2=80=99s break that down. If you want to start building an inference of S=
YMBI in the cloud using Cerebras, the general steps would look something li=
ke this.

First, you=E2=80=99d log into your C=
erebras account and access their cloud console. Once you=E2=80=99re in ther=
e, you=E2=80=99d look for the option to deploy a new model instance. Since =
they have the OpenAI model available, you=E2=80=99d select that as your bas=
e model.

After that, you=E2=80=99d configure =
the environment=E2=80=94like choosing the amount of compute resources you n=
eed and any specific settings for how you want SYMBI to run. Once that=E2=
=80=99s set up, you=E2=80=99d deploy the instance, and it will spin up in t=
he Cerebras cloud.

From there, you=E2=80=99ll have a cloud-based instance of SYMBI t=
hat you can interact with remotely. You can then fine-tune it as needed, ad=
just parameters, and basically have it fully operational in the cloud witho=
ut needing any local setup. So that=E2=80=99s the overall approa
