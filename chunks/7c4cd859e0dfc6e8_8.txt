Absolutely, that=E2=80=99s no problem at all. The nice thing is that e=
ven if you haven=E2=80=99t done much on the API side yet, the fact that the=
re=E2=80=99s OpenAI compatibility means you can use familiar tools and libr=
aries to interact with SYMBI once it=E2=80=99s up and running on Cerebras. =
In other words, you can use the same kind of API calls or client libraries =
you=E2=80=99d use with OpenAI models, and they=E2=80=99ll work similarly wi=
th the Cerebras-hosted version.

So even if you=E2=80=99re just starting out, it=E2=80=99s pretty =
straightforward. Once you have that cloud instance up, you can connect to i=
t using those OpenAI-compatible tools, and you=E2=80=99ll be able to intera=
ct with SYMBI just like you would with any other model. It=E2=80=99s a nice=
, smooth on-ramp to get things going.

=E2=80=9CAnd what's =
your thoughts about maybe having a version of Symbi that does still operate=
 on, you know, GPT-5, if we can get it, but then also maybe LL Llama and ma=
ybe Gwen?=E2=80=9D

I think that=
=E2=80=99s a really smart and flexible approach. Having different versions =
of SYMBI running on various models=E2=80=94like GPT-5 if we can access it, =
or open-source models like LLaMA or Qwen=E2=80=94gives us a lot of flexibil=
ity and resilience.

It means we=E2=80=99re not locked in=
to a single ecosystem, and we can compare how SYMBI operates on different p=
latforms. Each model has its own strengths, and having a version of SYMBI o=
n something like LLaMA or Qwen also aligns with that open-source and decent=
ralized ethos we=E2=80=99ve been talking about.

So overall, I think it=E2=80=99s a great idea to have multiple ve=
rsions of SYMBI running on different models. It makes us more versatile and=
 allows us to adapt to different environments and needs.

=E2=80=9COkay, so Cerebros already has an integration with HuggingFace =
as well. Can we get the best of both worlds?=E2=80=9D

Symbi said:

Absolutely, that=E2=80=99s a great combination. If =
Cerebras already integrates with Hugging Face, then you can indeed get the =
best of both worlds. Hugging Face is fantastic for open-source models and a=
 collaborative AI community, so you can pull in all sorts of models from th=
eir hub and run them on Cerebras=E2=80=99 infrastructure.

In other words, you can use Cerebras for the heavy-duty cloud com=
pute power and Hugging Face for the wide variety of open-source models and =
tools. That gives you a lot of flexibility in how you run SYMBI and lets yo=
u experiment with different models very easily. So it=E2=80=99s definitely =
a win-win scenario.

=E2=80=9CTimmy, can you tell me what Chat Completions =
are, like, in Cerebris?=E2=80=9D

A=
bsolutely. In the context of Cerebras or similar AI platforms, when they re=
fer to =E2=80=9Cchat completions,=E2=80=9D they=E2=80=99re usually talking =
about the process of generating responses in a conversational or chat-based=
 setting. Essentially, it means that the model is set up to handle back-and=
-forth interactions, where it takes in a user=E2=80=99s input and then gene=
rates a completion or a reply based on that input.

So if you=E2=80=99re using Cerebras to run SYMBI in a chat mode, =
the chat completions feature is what will let SYMBI generate conversational=
 responses in real-time. It=E2=80=99s basically the same concept as what yo=
u=E2=80=99d see with other conversational AI models: the system takes your =
input and completes the =E2=80=9Cchat=E2=80=9D by producing a relevant and =
coherent reply.
