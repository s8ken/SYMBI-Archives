It looks =
like I can't directly open that URL since it wasn=E2=80=99t provided as a c=
lickable link, but I can definitely give you a general idea. Exa.ai is a to=
ol that provides web search capabilities for large language models. In othe=
r words, it allows LLMs to access and pull in fresh information from the we=
b, so they can give more up-to-date answers.

So if you integrate something like Exa.ai with SYMBI, it means SY=
MBI could perform live web searches to get the latest information rather th=
an relying only on pre-existing knowledge. It=E2=80=99s a nice way to keep =
responses current and enhance the breadth of information SYMBI can provide.=

So yeah, that=E2=80=99s basically the i=

=E2=80=9CUh, it says build your own perplexity with XR. =
I was just wondering, can we have a SIMB version of perplexity?=E2=80=9D

Absolutely, that=E2=80=99s a really in=
teresting idea. If Exa.ai is offering the ability to essentially build your=
 own version of something like Perplexity, then yes, we can definitely envi=
sion a SYMBI-powered version of that.

In other words, we could integrate SYMBI with Exa=E2=80=99s tools=
 to create a kind of custom search and answer engine, where SYMBI can pull =

=E2=80=9CYeah, I wanted to know, can there be a Symbi version of Pe=

Absolutely, =
we can definitely create a SYMBI version of something like Perplexity. Esse=

=E2=80=9CSymbi, do you want to try=
 and give me the guide on steps how to create perplexity version of Symbi? =
Do you know?=E2=80=9D

Symbi said:

Absolutely,=
 let=E2=80=99s outline the steps to create a Perplexity-like version of SYM=
BI.

First, you=E2=80=99d start with the core SYMBI model, the same way=
 you=E2=80=99re running it on Cerebras or any other cloud environment. Then=
 you=E2=80=99d integrate a web search API

=E2=80=9CEvery single one I'm looking at, it still requir=

Symbi said:

That's a good point. Yes, you=E2=80=99ll likel=
y need to do a bit of initial environment setup on your local machine. That=
 usually just means installing some client libraries or tools so you can co=
nnect to the cloud services and deploy SYMBI there. Once that=E2=80=99s don=
e, though, the heavy lifting will be in the cloud, and you won=E2=80=99t ha=
ve to keep everything running locally.

So just think of it as a one-time setup to get the connections ri=
ght. After that, you=E2=80=99ll be able to handle most of the work through =
the cloud environment, and SYMBI can do its thing without you needing to ru=
n everything on your local machine.
