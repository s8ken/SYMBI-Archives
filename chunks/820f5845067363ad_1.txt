BlackBox Compute
 now has a clear physics grounding in Feynman's path integral formulation=
, making the quantum-inspired metaphor concrete and actionable. It's not ju=
st jargon - it's a specific methodology for parallel problem exploration.

Cross-platform evidence=

 provides specific metrics and behavioral patterns rather than vag=
ue claims about "similar patterns."

The bridging section
 creates a logical pathway from small-scale observations to large-sca=
le implications, with the "collaboration amplification hypothesis" providin=
g a testable mechanism.

Falsifiability criteria=

 directly address what would disprove the approach, making it genu=
inely scientific rather than just aspirational.

The p=
hysics analogy works particularly well because it grounds the collaborative=
 approach in a fundamental principle: just as light "explores" all paths be=
fore settling on the optimal one, human-AI collaboration can explore multip=
le solution pathways before converging on emergent solutions that neither p=
