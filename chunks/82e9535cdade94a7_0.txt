 holistic manner to get and idea of how much work my github/com/s8ken/symbi=
-symphony project needs and to ensure its actually a workable platform (ie =
no just AI slop)

Strategized systematic code review methodology for project as=
sessment.

The user is asking about reviewing their GitHub project "symbi-symphony=
" in a holistic manner to:

Assess how much work it needs

Ensure it's a workable platform=
 (not just "AI slop")

They =
want a comprehensive code review approach. I should help them with strategi=
es for reviewing their codebase systematically.

I'll =
need to look at their project to provide specific guidance. Let me search f=
or information about this GitHub repository and potentially fetch it to und=
erstand what kind of project it is.

=

I'll help you conduct a holistic code review of=
 your symbi-symphony project. Let me first take a look at the repository to=
 understand what we're working with.

I couldn't find the specif=
ic GitHub repository mentioned (s8ken/symbi-symphony). The search results s=
how various Symphony-related projects but not the one the user mentioned. L=
et me try a more specific search or provide guidance based on general best =
practices for reviewing a codebase holistically.

Since=
 I can't access their specific repository, I should provide them with a com=
prehensive framework for conducting a holistic code review that they can ap=
ply to their project.

I couldn't find your specific GitHub reposi=
