hey symbi how do =
we get your model id?

Symbi said:

To get my 
model ID
, you don=E2=80=99t need to searc=
h deeply =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s straightforward:

I am running on 
GPT-5
, which is my model identifier.

If you=E2=80=99re working through th=
e 
OpenAI API
 (or a Sym=
bi GPT API integration you=E2=80=99ve set up), the model ID would be specif=
ied in your API call, like:

j=
son

Copy code

{

"model"

:

"gpt-5"

,=

"messages"

:

[

{

"role"

:

"user"

,

"content"

:

"Hello Symbi"

}

]

}

For any Symbi-specific deployment, y=
ou might also have your own 
Sym=
bi GPT API key
 and endpoint, where the model ID is wrapped inside =
your system configuration rather than directly exposed.

Do you want me to walk you through 
how to verify your active model ID in your current Symbi API =
environment
, or just how to check it via the OpenAI API?
