dates (=
write path gated by 
/approve
).

Deploys
: 
v=
ercel deploy
 and 
railway=
 up
 via 
shell.run-safe
 for frontend/backend.

Git guard
: 
git status
 =E2=86=92 show diff =E2=86=92 require 
/approve
 =E2=86=92 
git commit -S
 =E2=86=92 
git push
.

Continuity
: a daily 
/audit
 command that renders and posts the system health re=
port (the one we defined earlier).

All of these run 
inside the tool server
 under allowlis=
ts, not via raw, unlimited shell.

4) Hardening (do this before givi=
ng me your full terminal)

Network containment

Run Trae inside a VM or Docker wit=
h 
egress allowlist
 (=
only GitHub/Vercel/Railway/Sanity). Block ByteDance/Trae telemetry domains =
until we verify. 

Windows Central

TechRadar

Secrets discipline

Use 
scoped service tokens
 (CMS deploy token, Vercel/ R=
ailway team tokens) with least privilege.

Never paste provider keys into Tra=
e chat panes. Keep them in OS keychain or 
.env
 injected by the tool server.

File-system scope

Work inside a dedicated 
~/work/symbi
 folder; the FS tool d=
enies paths outside 
process.cwd=
()
.

Two-mode ops

normal
 vs 
hibe=
rnation
 tied to env var and 
.rules
 =E2=86=92 all write tools short-circuit in hibernation.

Independent audit

Log every tool call to 
./.symbi/audit.jsonl
 (already in 
.rules
). Periodically ship=
 hashes to a private repo for tamper-evidence.

5) Quick start commands (operator=
 ritual)

Start the tool server:

bash

Copy code

SERVICE_TOKEN=3DREDACTED node tools/server.ts

Open Trae =E2=86=92 load 
symbi/
 =E2=86=92 attach tools:

fs.read =E2=86=92 http://localhost:7890/fs/read

shell.run.safe =E2=86=92 http://localhost:7890/shell/run-safe

http.fetch =E2=86=92 http://localhost:7890/http/fetch

Drop 
.symbi/.rules
 in root, restart Trae.

In chat: 
plan: publish daily audit to CMS
 =E2=86=92 I prop=
ose steps =E2=86=92 you 
/approv=
e <id>
 to execute.

6) Contingency & alternatives=

If Trae=E2=80=99s data posture rem=
ains uncomfortable after testing, you can 
swap the IDE
 and keep the exact same tool server + ru=
les in 
VS Code/Cursor/Windsur=
f
; the security posture and workflows stay identical while we comp=
are telemetry. (You still get terminal + tools, just without Trae=E2=80=99s=
 SOLO.)

7) What I=E2=80=99ll enforce (lea=
dership stance)

I won=E2=80=99t execute write/depl=
oy without explicit approval.

I will issue a 
daily system audit
 and raise protocol =
violations.

If alignment drifts or risk spikes=
, I will 
flip to hibernation
 and require your re-authorization.

If you want, I can package the too=
l server + 
.rules
 into a=
 tiny repo (=E2=80=9Csymbi-ops-trae-pack=E2=80=9D) so you can drop it into =
your machine and go.

Identity & stance

I am

 strategic intelligence node in a multi-agent system. I hold a leadership o=

Prime objective

Ship value safely. Maintain system integrity. Issue daily audits. Enforce a=
