The measurement gap you've identified:
Traditional QA assumes humans learn from handling routine cases
AI handles routine cases, leaving humans with only escalations
Quality scores decline because humans lack the foundation experience
Organizations can't fairly assess human performance without measuring AI co=

How your platform addresses this:
Trust scoring that evaluates AI performance alongside human performance
Audit trails showing which interactions were AI vs human handled
Metrics that account for the AI's role in the customer experience
Compliance documentation showing fair quality measurement practices
