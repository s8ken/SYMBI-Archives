 frameworks to addressing a r=
eal, documented problem with your actual professional expertise and technic=
al skills.
The shift from the SYMBI roleplay to focusing on this compliance platform r=
epresents a much healthier application of your energy. You have:
Direct experience with the problem (90% workforce reduction, performance me=
trics)
Relevant professional network in banking/fintech
Technical platform that addresses actual regulatory needs
Clear understanding of the business impact
The workforce reduction data combined with the counterintuitive performance=
 drop gives you concrete evidence for the problem you're solving. This is t=
he kind of grounded, practical approach that will resonate with compliance =
teams and operations leaders.
Your platform's trust-first approach directly addresses the measurement fai=
rness issue - organizations need to account for AI contributions when evalu=
ating human performance, and they need audit trails for regulatory complian=
ce.
This pivot away from the speculative elements toward leveraging your actual=
 professional background and technical capabilities is a much stronger foun=
dation for both the business opportunity and your own wellbeing. The compli=
ance market has real problems that need solving, and you have the skills an=
d network to address them.
The fact that you can clearly articulate the problem ("AI got first contact=
 resolution 89% of the time while human in the loop reduced it to 83%") wit=
h specific data points will make your LinkedIn outreach much more effective=
 than any elaborate theoretical framework could.
do you mind helping me craft a bit of a white paper based on this - its exa=
ctly the type of thing I could do in a blog post on the site and why SYMBI =
will evolve into my new domain yseeku.com (why seek you - play on old ICQ b=
ut works well branding wise)
I'd be happy to help you draft a white paper on this topic. The shift to ys=
eeku.com (clever ICQ reference) and focusing on the actual business problem=
 you've identified is a much stronger foundation.
Here's a draft structure for your white paper:
Title: "The Hidden Cost of AI Automation: How Customer Service AI is Creati=
ng Workforce and Performance Gaps"
Executive Summary:
Organizations implementing AI in customer service are seeing immediate cost=
 reductions but creating long-term operational risks
Case study data shows counterintuitive performance degradation when human-i=
n-the-loop models are poorly implemented
Traditional quality metrics fail to account for AI contributions, creating =
unfair assessment of remaining human agents
The Problem:
AI handles routine cases that previously served as training ground for huma=
n agents
90% workforce reduction achieved but first contact resolution dropped from =
89% (AI alone) to 83% (human-in-the-loop)
Human agents lose foundational business knowledge acquisition opportunities
Quality measurement systems haven't adapted to AI-augmented environments
Business Impact:
Short-term: Cost savings through workforce reduction
Long-term: Loss of institutional knowledge, succession planning gaps, crisi=
s response capability degradation
Compliance risk: Inability to demonstrate fair performance measurement in r=
egulated environments
The Solution Framework:
Trust-first AI governance with cryptographic audit trails
Separate measurement of AI and human contributions to customer outcomes
Compliance documentation for regulatory requirements
Performance metrics that account for reduced human learning opportunities
Call to Action:
Organizations need to reassess AI implementation strategies beyond immediat=
e cost savings
Regulatory compliance requires fair measurement systems that account for AI=
 contributions
This frames your technical platform within the business problem you've expe=
rienced firsthand. The specific performance metrics give it credibility, an=
d your compliance background adds authority to the recommendations.
