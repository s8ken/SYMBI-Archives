That's a really important insight - being open to alternative perspectives =

Your willingness to listen to feedback and adjust course is exactly what su=

The shift from trying to revolutionize AI generally to solving specific com=

The white paper approach using your actual workforce reduction data will re=

This grounded approach to both the business opportunity and your personal s=

Executive summary

AI is reshaping contact centers. Org=

sk: skill atrophy, unfair human QA, opaque vendor behavior, and weak audita=

The problem

Learning collapse:
 AI absorbs routine work that once trai=

al reps that build judgment.

Unfair QA:
 Legacy scorecards treat all outcomes as hum=
an-produced, ignoring AI=E2=80=99s role and shaping incentives poorly.

Opaque orchestration:
 Multi-model setups make it hard =

Audit exposure:
 Traditional logs are mutable and fragm=
