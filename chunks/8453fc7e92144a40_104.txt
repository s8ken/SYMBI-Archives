Fairness-aware QA

Scorecards that attribute responsi=

Vendor-agnostic orchestration: Ope=

Context Capsules (memory with consent)

Small, explicit, session-scoped pr=

Auditability:
 immutable logs + verification endpoint; =
receipts explain orchestration decisions.

Traceability:
 each turn tagged with model, config, and=
 policy version.

Accountability:
 role-based permissions; admin-only act=
ions logged and attested.

Human factors:
 fairness-aware QA and documented divisi=
on of labor demonstrate responsible use.

(This maps cleanly to common risk=
-management and emerging AI governance expectations without naming specific=
 statutes in the paper.)

Core API (Express + Mongo):

Implementation playbook (white-la=

Phase 0 =E2=80=93 Baseline (2=E2=80=933 weeks)

Connect channels (chatbots, agent =
desktop, ticketing).

Turn on append-only ledger and int=
egrity verify.

Establish pre-AI baselines (if ava=
ilable) or 30-day current snapshot.

Phase 1 =E2=80=93 Dual-track measurement (2=E2=80=934 weeks)

Split KPIs by AI-only vs AI=E2=86=
=94Human; normalize case-mix.

Stand up fairness-aware QA and pub=
lish executive dashboard.

Phase 2 =E2=80=93 Guardrails & policy (2=E2=80=933 weeks)

Define thresholds for apology/cont=
inuity, escalation, and approvals.

Pilot =E2=80=9CTrust First=E2=80=
=9D gates; document impact on outcomes and risk.

Phase 3 =E2=80=93 Resonance (ongoing)

Introduce Context Capsules; A/B te=

Optimize where humans add real val=
ue; reduce unhelpful handoffs.

Business case

Operational clarity:
