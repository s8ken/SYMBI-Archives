audit
  trails and RBAC ready

  Your demo will showcase a
   $62B market opportunity
  in Enterprise AI Trust
  Infrastructure. The
  platform demonstrates
  production-readiness with
   just minor security
  improvements needed for
  full deployment.

  Ready to impress=20

  Would you like me to help
   you deploy it now or
  prepare any additional
  materials (pitch deck
  points, demo script,
  etc.)?

> yes i would love for you to
   help me deploy it

=E2=8F=BA Perfect! Let's deploy
  your demo to Vercel right
   now. I'll walk you
  through it step by step.

=E2=8F=BA Let's start by deploying
  to Vercel. Since you've
  already logged in, let's
  run the deployment:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(vercel --prod)
  =E2=8E=BF https://symbi-synergy-
    pa9k82n5m-ycq.vercel.a
    pp
    =E2=80=A6 +29 lines (ctrl+r to
     expand)

=E2=8F=BA Excellent! Your app is
  deployed! =F0=9F=8E=89

  Live URL:
  https://symbi-synergy-pa9
  k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app

  Now let's configure the
  environment variables. We
   need to set up the demo
  environment variables in
  Vercel Dashboard:

=E2=8F=BA Let me help you set up
  the environment
  variables. We can do this
   via Vercel CLI:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(vercel env add NODE_ENV)
  =E2=8E=BF Vercel CLI 46.1.1    =20
    Retrieving project=E2=80=A6
    ? What's the value of
    =E2=80=A6 +2 lines (ctrl+r to=20
    expand)

=E2=8F=BA Let me try a different
  approach using the
  dashboard. Let me create
  a script to help you add
  all the environment
  variables at once:

=E2=8F=BA Write(~/SYMBI-SYNERGY-Enterpr
       ise/setup-vercel-env.md)
  =E2=8E=BF Wrote 98 lines to    =20
    ../setup-vercel-env.md

    # =F0=9F=9A=80 VERCEL
    ENVIRONMENT SETUP
    ## Your App is Live!
    **URL**: https://symbi
    -synergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq
    .vercel.app
    ## Next Step:
    Configure Environment
    Variables
    ### Go to Vercel
    Dashboard:
    1. Visit: https://verc
    el.com/dashboard
    2. Click on your
    project:
    **symbi-synergy**
    =E2=80=A6 +88 lines (ctrl+r to
     expand)

=E2=8F=BA Let me check if we can
  test the current
  deployment:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(curl -s
      https://symbi-synergy-pa9
      k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app/api
       | head -20)
  =E2=8E=BF <!doctype html><html l
    ang=3Den><meta charset=3Du
    tf-8><meta name=3Dviewpo
    =E2=80=A6 +657 lines (ctrl+r=20
    to expand)

=E2=8F=BA I see the issue - your
  Vercel deployment has
  authentication protection
   enabled. Let me help you
   configure this. For now,
   let's try to access the
  frontend:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(curl -s
      https://symbi-synergy-pa9
      k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app |
      head -20)
  =E2=8E=BF <!doctype html><html l
    ang=3Den><meta charset=3Du
    tf-8><meta name=3Dviewpo
    =E2=80=A6 +657 lines (ctrl+r=20
    to expand)

=E2=8F=BA Perfect! The issue is
  that your Vercel
  deployment has Deployment
   Protection enabled,
  which is actually a good
  security feature. Let me
  update the instructions:

=E2=8F=BA Update(~/SYMBI-SYNERGY-Enterp
        rise/setup-vercel-env.m
        d)
  =E2=8E=BF Updated              =20
    ../setup-vercel-env.md

     1 removal
