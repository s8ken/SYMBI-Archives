  Would you like me to help
   you with the Vercel
  dashboard configuration,
  or do you have any
  questions about the demo
  setup?

> yes please help me with=20
  that i turned off=20
  deployment protection just=20
  now temporarily

=E2=8F=BA Perfect! Let's test your
  demo now that deployment
  protection is off and
  then configure the
  environment variables.

=E2=8F=BA Excellent! Now let's test
   your demo:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(curl -s
      https://symbi-synergy-pa9
      k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app |
      head -30)
  =E2=8E=BF <!doctype html><html l
    ang=3D"en"><head><meta c
    harset=3D"utf-8"/><link
    =E2=80=A6 +28 lines (ctrl+r to
     expand)

=E2=8F=BA Perfect! Your frontend is
   now accessible. Now
  let's test the API:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(curl -s https://symbi-sy
      nergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.verce
      l.app/api)
  =E2=8E=BF <!doctype html><html l
    ang=3D"en"><head><meta c
    harset=3D"utf-8"/><link
    =E2=80=A6 +28 lines (ctrl+r to
     expand)

=E2=8F=BA I see the API is routing
  to the frontend. This is
  because we need to
  configure the environment
   variables first. Let me
  help you set those up via
   Vercel CLI:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(vercel env add NO
