    Retrieving project=E2=80=A6
    ? What's the value of
    =E2=80=A6 +2 lines (ctrl+r to=20
    expand)

=E2=8F=BA Let me try a different
  approach. I'll create a
  script to add all
  environment variables at
  once:

=E2=8F=BA Write(~/SYMBI-SYNERGY-Enterpr
       ise/add-vercel-env.sh)
  =E2=8E=BF Wrote 36 lines to    =20

    #!/bin/bash
    # Add essential demo=20
    environment variables=20
    to Vercel
    echo "Adding=20
    environment variables=20
    to Vercel..."
    # Basic demo=20
    configuration
    vercel env add
    NODE_ENV <<< "demo"
    vercel env add
    DEMO_MODE <<< "true"
    vercel env add PORT
    <<< "5000"
    =E2=80=A6 +26 lines (ctrl+r to

=E2=8F=BA Let me give you the
  manual steps since the
  CLI method can be tricky.
   Here's exactly what to
  do:

  =F0=9F=94=A7 Manual Environment=20
  Variable Setup in Vercel=20
  Dashboard

  Step 1: Go to Vercel=20
  Dashboard

  1. Visit: https://vercel.
  com/dashboard
  2. Click on your
  symbi-synergy project
  3. Go to Settings tab
  4. Click Environment=20
  Variables in the left
  sidebar

  Step 2: Add These=20
  Variables One by One

  Click Add and enter each
  of these:

  Basic Configuration:
  Name: NODE_ENV
  Value: demo
  Environment: Production,=20
  Preview, Development

  Name: DEMO_MODE =20
  Value: true
  Environment: Production,=20
  Preview, Development

  Name: JWT_SECRET
  Value: demo-jwt-secret-fo
  r-showcase-only
  Environment: Production,=20
  Preview, Development

  CORS Configuration:
  Name: CORS_ORIGIN
  Value:=20
  https://symbi-synergy-pa9
  k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app
  Environment: Production,=20
  Preview, Development

  Demo Limits:
  Name: DEMO_RATE_LIMIT
  Value: 50
  Environment: Production,

  Value: 900
  Environment: Production,
  Preview, Development

  Frontend Demo Mode:

  Step 3: Redeploy

  After adding all
  variables:
  1. Go to Deployments tab
  2. Click the three dots
  on your latest deployment
  3. Click Redeploy
  4. Wait for deployment to
   complete (~2-3 minutes)

  Would you like me to walk
   you through this step by
   step, or would you
  prefer to try the
  environment variable
  setup yourself first?

> all done

=E2=8F=BA Fantastic! =F0=9F=8E=89 Now let's
  test your demo to make
  sure everything is
  working properly.

=E2=8F=BA Perfect! Let's test your
  deployed demo:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(curl -s https://symbi-sy
      nergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.verce
      l.app/api)
  =E2=8E=BF <!doctype html><html l
    ang=3D"en"><head><meta c
    harset=3D"utf-8"/><link
    =E2=80=A6 +28 lines (ctrl+r to
     expand)

=E2=8F=BA The API is still routing
  to the frontend. Let me
  check if there's a
  routing issue. Let me try
   a more specific
  endpoint:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(curl -s -H
      "Content-Type:
      application/json"
      https://symbi-synergy-pa9
      k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app/api
      /healthz)
  =E2=8E=BF <!doctype html><html l
    ang=3D"en"><head><meta c
    harset=3D"utf-8"/><link
    =E2=80=A6 +28 lines (ctrl+r to
     expand)

=E2=8F=BA I see the issue! The
  Vercel routing isn't
  working properly. Let me
  check your vercel.json
  configuration. The API
  routes should be handled
  by the serverless
  function, but it's
  falling through to the
  frontend catch-all route.

=E2=8F=BA Read(~/SYMBI-SYNERGY-Enterpri
      se/vercel.json)
  =E2=8E=BF Read 98 lines (ctrl+r=20

=E2=8F=BA I see the issue! Let me
  check your API entry
  point:

=E2=8F=BA Read(~/SYMBI-SYNERGY-Enterpri
      se/api/index.js)
  =E2=8E=BF Read 5 lines (ctrl+r =20

=E2=8F=BA I found the issue!
  There's a typo in your
  API entry point. Let me
  fix it:

=E2=8F=BA Update(~/SYMBI-SYNERGY-Enterp
        rise/api/index.js)
  =E2=8E=BF Updated              =20
    ../api/index.js with
