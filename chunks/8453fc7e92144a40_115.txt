In SPA routers, preserve hash navi=

 on mount if

 exists).

Verify the nav link uses a real an=

Concept fit:

Tone:
 premium/enterprise without sounding buzzy.

Ownable pairing:

ely in enterprise AI.

Watch-outs (easy to mitigate)

Pronunciation drift:
 =E2=80=9Cso-NAH-tay=E2=80=9D vs =E2=
=80=9Cso-NAT.=E2=80=9D Fix: include a pronunciation note in the brand guide=
 and use the pair 
YCQ Sonate
 consistently.

SEO clutter:
 =E2=80=9CSonata=E2=80=9D (car/drug/music) is=
 crowded. Fix: lean on the 
YCQ
 prefix and long-tail descriptors (e.g., =E2=80=9CYCQ Sonate trust =
ledger=E2=80=9D).

International:
 =E2=80=9CSonate=E2=80=9D =3D =E2=80=9Csona=
