  =E2=9C=85 Completed Tasks

  1. Functional Download Buttons: Created comprehensive UAT report
  and Postman collection with real technical content, deployed to
  website
  2. Provisional Patent Info: Added to homepage with professional
  badge display
  3. Demo Environment Branding: Fixed all SYMBI =E2=86=92 YCQ Sonate
  references in frontend/src/components/layout/Header.js:90,
  Sidebar.js:92, and Register.js:140

  The commit was successful with 76 files changed, ensuring the
  demo environment now consistently shows "YCQ Sonate" branding
  across all components. The website is live with functional
  downloads and patent information displayed professionally.

  you reccomend?

=E2=8F=BA Yes, BrowserStack can definitely be used to test your actual YCQ
  Sonate system! It's excellent for cross-browser and device
  testing. Here are the best approaches:

  BrowserStack Options

  Live Testing: Test your deployed system interactively across
  different browsers/devices
  Automate Testing: Run automated test suites via
  Selenium/Playwright
  Local Testing: Test localhost/staging environments securely via
  BrowserStack Local tunnel

  Recommended Testing Stack

  For a platform like yours, I'd suggest a multi-layered approach:

  1. BrowserStack - Cross-browser compatibility, mobile
  responsiveness
  2. Playwright - E2E automation, API testing, screenshot
  comparison
  3. Jest + Supertest - Backend API testing (you already have this)
  4. Lighthouse CI - Performance and accessibility auditing

  Quick Setup for Your System

=E2=8F=BA Read(backend/tests)
  =E2=8E=BF  Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read

=E2=8F=BA Bash(ls backend/tests/)

=E2=8F=BA Perfect! You already have a solid test foundation. Here's my
  recommendation:

  For YCQ Sonate Testing

  Best Approach: Playwright + BrowserStack combo

  1. Playwright (Primary - FREE)

  - Tests your actual deployed system at ycq-website.vercel.app
  - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Mobile testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
  - Screenshot comparison, accessibility testing
  - Integrates with your existing Jest setup

  2. BrowserStack (Secondary - for edge cases)

  - Specific browser versions (IE11, older Safari)
  - Real device testing (actual iPhones, Android devices)
  - Live debugging of complex issues

  Quick Implementation

  Since you already have backend tests, you could add E2E tests:

  npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
  npx playwright install

  Test your live system:
  // tests/e2e/website.spec.js
  test('YCQ Sonate homepage loads correctly', async ({ page }) =3D> {
    await page.goto('https://ycq-website.vercel.app');
    await expect(page.getByText('YCQ Sonate')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.getByText('Provisional Patent=20
  Filed')).toBeVisible();
  });

  Cost Comparison

  - Playwright: FREE, runs on your CI/CD
  - BrowserStack: $29/month for unlimited automated testing

  Recommendation: Start with Playwright (free), add BrowserStack
  only if you need specific legacy browser support or real device
  testing.
