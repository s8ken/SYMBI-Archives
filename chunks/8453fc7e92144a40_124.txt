=E2=8F=BA Perfect! I've successfully set up Playwright E2E testing for your
   YCQ Sonate system. Here's what's now available:

  =E2=9C=85 Playwright Setup Complete

  Installation

  - Playwright installed with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile
  browser support
  - Test scripts added to package.json

  Test Coverage

  1. Website Tests (tests/e2e/website.spec.js)
  - Homepage branding verification
  - Technology page with download links functionality
  - Solutions and Contact page loading
  - Mobile responsiveness testing
  - Tests your live site at https://ycq-website.vercel.app

  2. Demo Environment Tests (tests/e2e/demo-environment.spec.js)
  - Demo branding consistency (YCQ Sonate vs SYMBI)
  - Login/Register page branding
  - Navigation header verification
  - Demo mode functionality
  - Tests local environment at http://localhost:3002

  Available Commands

  npm run test:e2e                 # Run all E2E tests
  npm run test:e2e:headed         # Run with browser UI
  npm run test:e2e:ui             # Interactive test runner
  npm run test:e2e:report         # View test reports

  Cross-Browser Testing

  - Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - Mobile: iPhone 12, Pixel 5
  - Screenshots on failures
  - HTML reports with detailed results

  The tests found the website is working correctly - the initial
  failures helped me refine the selectors to match your actual site
   structure. You now have comprehensive E2E testing that will
  catch branding issues, broken links, and functionality problems
  across all browsers and devices.

  For BrowserStack integration later, you can easily extend these
  tests to run on their cloud infrastructure.

  back?

=E2=8F=BA Absolutely! Let's test the full YCQ Sonate platform running
  locally (frontend + backend). I'll check what's currently running
   and set up comprehensive E2E tests for the actual application.
