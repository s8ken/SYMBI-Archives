=E2=8F=BA Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Playwright testing suite
  for your YCQ Sonate platform. Here's what I recommend:

  =F0=9F=A7=AA Comprehensive Playwright Test Suite

  1. Performance Tests (performance.spec.js)

  - Page load times (<3 seconds)
  - Memory usage monitoring (prevents memory leaks)
  - API response times (<1 second)
  - Large page rendering (reports, data tables)

  2. Accessibility Tests (accessibility.spec.js)

  - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
  - Screen reader compatibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
  - Color contrast and font size validation
  - Mobile touch target sizes (>32px)
  - Focus management in modals/dialogs

  3. Security Tests (security.spec.js)

  - XSS prevention (script injection protection)
  - No sensitive data exposure (API keys, passwords)
  - Authentication protection for sensitive routes
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

  4. API Integration Tests (api-integration.spec.js)

  - Backend connectivity and health checks
  - CORS configuration validation
  - Error handling and graceful degradation
  - Rate limiting behavior
  - WebSocket/SSE real-time features
  - Large data handling

  =F0=9F=9A=80 Available Test Commands

  # Run specific test suites
  npm run test:e2e:full          # Core platform functionality
  npm run test:e2e:performance   # Performance benchmarks
  npm run test:e2e:security     # Security vulnerabilities =20
  npm run test:e2e:accessibility # WCAG compliance
  npm run test:e2e:api          # API integration
  npm run test:e2e:website      # Production website

  # Run all tests
  npm run test:e2e:all          # Complete test suite
  npm run test:e2e:headed       # Visual test execution
  npm run test:e2e:ui           # Interactive test runner

  =F0=9F=8E=AF Additional Test Recommendations

  For BrowserStack Integration:

  1. Cross-browser compatibility (IE11, Safari versions)
  2. Real device testing (iPhone, Android variations)
  3. Network condition testing (3G, slow connections)
  4. Geolocation testing (different regions)

  For Production:

  1. Load testing with Artillery or k6
  2. Visual regression tests with Percy or Chromatic
  3. Lighthouse CI integration for performance scores
  4. Database stress testing with large datasets

  For AI Features:

  1. Conversation flow testing
  2. Agent interaction simulation
  3. Context bridge functionality
  4. Real-time collaboration testing

  This test suite provides enterprise-grade coverage for
  functionality, performance, security, and accessibility - perfect
   for demonstrating platform reliability to investors and
  enterprise clients!

> okay please proceed

=E2=8F=BA I'll run the performance tests to see how your YCQ Sonate
  platform performs:

=E2=8F=BA Bash(npm run test:e2e:performance)
  =E2=8E=BF  Error: Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
