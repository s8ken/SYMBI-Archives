4) Safari timeouts (mobile + desk=
top)

Make Safari tests serial where the=
y share auth or navigation state.

js

Copy code

// tests/e2e/full-platform.s=
pec.js (at top)

import

 { test=
 } 

from

'@playwright/test'

;
test.

describe

.

configure

=

({ 

mode

: 

'serial'

 }); 

// reduces webkit flake

Also add a small network idle wait=
 after navigations that are content-heavy:

js

Copy code

await

 pa=
ge.

goto

(

'/dashboard'

, { 

waitUntil

: =

'networkidle'

 =
});

5) (Optional) Add a health =E2=80=
=9Cready=E2=80=9D gate in app shell

Ensures UI waits until API is reac=
hable=E2=80=94reduces first-render race during tests.

jsx

Copy code

// frontend/src/app/ApiRead=
yGate.jsx

import

React

from

'react'

;

export

default

function

ApiReadyGate

(
=

{ children }

) {

const

 [read=
y, setReady] =3D 

React

.

useState

(

false

);

React

.=

useEffect

(

() =3D>

 {

const

 t =
=3D 

setTimeout

(

async

 () =
=3D> {

try

 {

const

=
 r =3D 

await

 =

fetch

=
(

'/api/health'

=
);

setReady

(r.

ok

);
      } 

catch

=
 { 

setReady

=

(

false

)=
; }
    }, 

0

);

return

() =3D>

clearTimeout

(t)=
;
  }, []);

if

 (!ready)=

return

<
div

role

"status"

aria-live

"polite"

>Loading=E2=80=A6

</
div

return

 chil=
dren;
}

Wrap your app content once at the =
root (in demo/dev only).

What this fixes

Auth timeouts
 =E2=86=92 removed via API-seeded 
storageState
 (no UI login in te=
sts).

Main landmark
 =E2=86=92 test now runs 
after
 guaranteed auth + landing.

Form focus
 =E2=86=92 robust role/test-ID selectors and=
 focus checks.

Safari flake
 =E2=86=92 retries + serial + networkidle.=

Expected:
 this should push you 
well past 90%
 on the next run, with any rem=
aining reds likely being true UI assertions (we can mop those up fast).

If you want, I can also add a 
test:e2e:auth
 one-liner that=
 (re)generates 
playwright/.auth=
/ycq.json
 locally for devs.

SYMBI Synergy

Trust-first AI for everyday work

One place to think with many AIs=E2=
=80=94
safely, clearly, and with =
receipts
.

SYMBI coordinates top models (ChatGPT, Claude, and more) and returns one, c=
alm answer with a simple proof of how it got there.

Why SYMBI?

Clarity, not chaos
 =E2=80=93 You ask once. SYMBI does the=
 leg-work across models and tools, then gives you a single, clean reply.

Trust you can see
 =E2=80=93 Every conversation comes with=
 a 
Trust Receipt
: what=
 influenced the answer, when, and why.

Memory on your terms
 =E2=80=93 Keep helpful context (goal=
s, tone, preferences) as small 
=
Context Capsules
 you can view, edit, export, or erase.

Boundaries built in
 =E2=80=93 Our 
Bonding
 setup takes 2 minutes to set tone, li=
mits, and what=E2=80=99s off-limits=E2=80=94SYMBI sticks to it.

Private by design
 =E2=80=93 Your data is yours. No ad tar=
geting. Clear controls. One-click delete.

How it works (in plain language)

Ask SYMBI

Type your question or paste a task. Big or small=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cplan my w=
eek,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Crewrite this email,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cexplain this P=

SYMBI=E2=80=99s Roundtable

Behind the scenes, SYMBI consults multiple AIs/tools and compares proposals=
. No noise=E2=80=94just the best path forward.

You get one answer + a Trust Receipt

A focused response, with a tiny =E2=80=9Creceipt=E2=80=9D showing sources, =
checks, and any guardrails triggered.

Continuity when you want it

Turn on a 
Context Capsule
 so SYMBI remembers your preferences (e.g., =E2=80=9Cconcise, friendly=
, no jargon=E2=80=9D). Turn it off anytime.
