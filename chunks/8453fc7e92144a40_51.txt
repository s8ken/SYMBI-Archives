Surface 1:

Purpose:
 deep dev workflows; chat + commands inside the I=

Roundtable
 (Bridge) =E2=86=92 
/api/bridge/orchestrate
 and 
/dispatch
 to coordinate Codex/Trae/v0.

Secrets
: only 
SYMBI_API_KEY
 in SecretStorage.

Dev Container
 optional for instant Node+Mongo.

Outcome: builders get speed and fa=
