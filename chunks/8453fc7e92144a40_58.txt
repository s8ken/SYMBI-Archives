Secrets: only SYMBI_API_KEY in SecretStorage.
Dev Container optional for instant Node+Mongo.
Outcome: builders get speed and familiar ergonomics; zero vendor keys in th=
e IDE.
Surface 2: Web App (Trust Console) (for creators, reviewers, non-devs)
Purpose: clarity, oversight, and safe creation=E2=80=94trust overlays front=
 and center.
Chat + Trust Overlay: show pivot, disclosure, guardrail actions inline (chi=
ps).
Timeline/Insights: /api/insights/timeline visualized; jump to excerpts.
Ledger Integrity: one-click verify; export case bundles.
Assistants UX: =E2=80=9CUse Most Recent=E2=80=9D + =E2=80=9CEdit Assistant=
=E2=80=9D, live models via /api/llm/models/openai.
Context Bridge: bring in docs/links; store Context Capsule for sovereignty =
and reuse.
Roles: viewer/operator/admin; strong RBAC for audits/deletes.
Outcome: anyone can co-create safely, see what changed and why, and approve=

PR-F: Hygiene

Success Criteria (ship check)
One conversation: you talk to SYMBI anywhere; it orchestrates Codex/Trae/v0=
 via Bridge.
Trust overlays visible in the Web App; minimal chips in the extension.
Recent sessions & verify work in both surfaces.
No vendor keys in clients; SYMBI_API_KEY only.
Hibernation switch blocks writes across both surfaces.

What I Can Do Now

VS Code extension: Added a working skeleton wired to your API.
Dev Container: Added Node+Mongo setup for quick, consistent local dev.
Orchestrator (Bridge): Added minimal server endpoints to gather/rank propos=
als and dry=E2=80=91run dispatch.
What I=E2=80=99ve Implemented

VS Code extension (chat, ledger, status, roundtable)
