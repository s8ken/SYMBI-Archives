Bridge participants
: 
backend/bridge/bridge.config.yaml
 (enable/disable agents;=
 add tokens if needed).

Session mapping
: conversations already append a ledger=
 event per user=E2=86=92AI turn; session_id =3D conversation id by default.=

RBAC
 (recommended tighten): ensure admin guards on sen=
sitive trust routes; keep webhooks HMAC-verified.

7) Security posture (quick recap)=

Clients store 
only

SYMBI_API_KEY
 (scoped). Vendor keys remain server-side.

CORS is allow-listed by env; rate-=
limits + Helmet + sanitizers enabled.

Socket.IO requires JWT on connect;=
 room-join checks enforce conversation ownership.

8) Rollback (fully reversible)

Feature guard: set 
HIBERNATION=3Dtrue
 (if you=E2=80=99ve a=
dded a kill-switch) to block writes.

Git: revert the =E2=80=9Cbridge + =
extension + TrustChips=E2=80=9D PR or switch back to your previous branch.

Data: ledger is append-only; you c=
an filter out experimental sessions by 
session_id
 during analysis.

No time to structure it? just paste =
the raw feedback, and I=E2=80=99ll parse it.

What I=E2=80=99ll do the moment you =

cluster by 
area/priority
, map to existing work (WSID/AUX/C=

produce a

emit ready-to-paste 
issue tickets
 and, if helpful, a 
Roundtable task
 for the or=
