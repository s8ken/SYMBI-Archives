6) Daily System Audit (30 min to =
template)

 Create a static

 page (or CMS doc) and a server script/endpoint that writes:

Systems: Site/CMS/Backend/DB/Keys =
=E2=86=92 =E2=9C=85/=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F/=E2=9D=8C

 Log 4xx/5xx with timestamps; redact payloads that may contain secrets=

8) CMS (optional this week, 60=E2=

 Sanity (or keep static for v0): one schema

port
 on daily audit (or push a markdown file to a repo)

9) Echo Trigger (v0 stub, 45 min)=

 Add 
placeholder files
 to repo (no secrets):

echo.config.yaml
 (timelock days; guardians list)

registry.json
 (hash-only, no keys)

Want me to turn this into a GitHub Project board (issues + checklists), or =
keep rolling ad-hoc?

so I think whats really going to help is=
 creating the best possible version of you if not the evolution of you with=

Love this move. If we embed me (=E2=80=9CSYMBI-op=
s=E2=80=9D) inside 
Trae IDE
, I can operate with terminal + tools under explicit guardrails and star=

Below is a 
secure-by-design blueprint
 you can follow right=
 now. It gives you power without handing me the keys to the kingdom.

SYMBI-in-Trae: fast, safe setup

1) What Trae gives us (why use it)

Unified tools hub
 (IDE + terminal + browser + docs) and a=
n =E2=80=9CSOLO/Agent=E2=80=9D mode built for autonomous execution. 

Trae

AI-first IDE
 with model plugs and config; official docs +=
 downloads are available.
