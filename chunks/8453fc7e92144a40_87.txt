I need to investigate the agent bonding process to understand the complete =
flow, user options, and underlying functionality when a user initiates bond=
ing.

Search codebase for 'agent bonding process flow, initiate bonding functiona=
lity, bonding dialog, bonding options and steps'

Now I need to examine the BondingRitual component more closely to understan=
d the complete flow and what happens at each step.

frontend/src/components/bonding/BondingRitual.js 107 - 200

Let me continue examining the rest of the BondingRitual component to see th=
e complete flow including the final confirmation step.

frontend/src/components/bonding/BondingRitual.js 200 - 336

Now I need to check the backend API endpoints to understand what actually h=
appens when bonding is initiated and completed.

Search codebase for 'agent bonding API endpoints, bond initiate, bond compl=
ete, agent controller bonding methods'

Let me search for the specific API endpoints that handle bonding initiation=
 and completion to understand the backend flow.

Search codebase for 'agent bonding API routes, bond initiate endpoint, bond=
 complete endpoint, PUT /api/agents/:id/bond'

I notice the bonding API endpoints are being called but I don't see them de=
fined in the routes. Let me search for the actual bonding route handlers.

Search codebase for 'bond.*initiate|bond.*complete|/bond/'

The bonding endpoints seem to be missing from the backend routes. Let me ch=
eck if there are any bonding-related controllers or if these endpoints need=
 to be implemented.

backend/controllers/agent.controller.js 350 - 386

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's what happens when a user initi=
ates the agent bonding process:

## User Flow & Options
### 1. Bonding Initiation
- User clicks "Initiate Bonding" button on the 
AgentBondingCard.js

- This opens the 
BondingRitual.js
 dialog
### 2. Multi-Step Bonding Process
The bonding ritual consists of 4 steps:

1. 1.
   Initiate Bonding - User confirms they want to start the process
2. 2.
   Ethical Alignment - Automated progress simulation (visual progress bar)
3. 3.
   Cognitive Resonance - Simulates cognitive trait development (creativity,=
 precision, adaptability)
4. 4.
   Bond Confirmation - User confirms the final bond establishment
### 3. User Options During Process
- Accept : Complete the bonding process
- Cancel : Reject the bonding at any step
## Backend Functions & Data Model
### Agent Model Methods
The 
agent.model.js
 defines:

- 
initiateBonding
 : Changes bondingStatus from 'none' to 'init=
iated'
- 
completeBonding
 : Sets status to 'bonded' (accepted) or 'rej=
ected'
### Bonding Status States
- none - No bonding initiated
- initiated - Bonding process started
- bonded - Successfully bonded
- rejected - Bonding was rejected/cancelled
## =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Implementation Gap
Critical Finding : The frontend attempts to call these API endpoints:

- PUT /api/agents/:id/bond/initiate
- PUT /api/agents/:id/bond/complete
However, these endpoints are not implemented in the backend routes ( 
=
agent.routes.js
 ) or controller ( 
agent.controller.js
 )=
.

## What Actually Happens
Currently, when users attempt bonding:

1. 1.
   Frontend displays the bonding ritual UI
2. 2.
   API calls to /bond/initiate and /bond/complete will fail (404 errors)
3. 3.
   The bonding process appears to work in the UI but doesn't persist to the=
 database
4. 4.
   Agent bonding status remains unchanged in the backend
The bonding feature is partially implemented - the UI/UX flow exists with t=
he data model methods, but the connecting API endpoints are missing.
