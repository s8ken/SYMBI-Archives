SYMBI vs. OVERSEER =E2=80=94 Functio=

One-liners

SYMBI
 =3D

cution & orchestration core.
 Runs conversations, multi-agent r=
ounds, trust/ledger writes, guardrails, and memory capsules. Leads within p=
rotocol.

OVERSEER

=
Governance & assurance layer.
 Watches the whole organism, enfo=
rces protocol, audits integrity, gates risky actions, and controls hibernat=

Where this lives in the app 
today

SYMBI
 is already embodied by your Express services (as=

e + Web surfaces that speak to them.

OVERSEER
 exists 
implicitly
 (RBAC, ledger verify, hibernation concept) bu=
t not as a clean module/endpoints. The behaviors are described in your cont=
inuity/security notes (mutual verification; hibernation mode) but aren=E2=
=80=99t yet formalized as an agent/service with its own API.

Make it explicit (single PR plan)=

Goal:
 carve out Overseer as a thin, authoritative serv=
ice boundary=E2=80=94no feature creep, just governance.
