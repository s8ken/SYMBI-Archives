3) Docs & UAT tidy

In the 
UAT notebook / README
, replace:

=E2=80=9CContext Bridge =E2=80=94 =
manage sharing between Symbi and Overseer=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 =E2=80=9CConte=
xt =E2=80=94 manage sources for SYMBI=E2=80=9D.

Remove any =E2=80=9COverseer tab=
=E2=80=9D screenshots/steps.

Leave the =E2=80=9COverseer (futur=
e)=E2=80=9D roadmap line in 
S=
HIP_READY_IMPROVEMENTS.md
, but not in the demo flow.

Search/replace helper:

bash

Copy code

rg -n 

"Overse=
er"

 --ignore-case docs frontend README* SYMBI_UAT_NOTEB=
OOK.md

4) Extension (nothing to do)

The VS Code extension never expose=
d =E2=80=9COverseer=E2=80=9D UI; no changes needed.

5) Done criteria (POC simplicity)=

The page title now reads 
=E2=80=9CContext=E2=80=9D
.

The subtitle no longer mentions Ov=
erseer.

The 
Create Bridge
 button is gone.

Tabs show only 
ALL
 and 
SYMBI
.

No yellow =E2=80=9Cvector unavaila=
ble=E2=80=9D banner in POC.

No backend references to 
/api/overseer/*
 unless the flag i=
s re-enabled.

Rollback (when you want governanc=
e back)

Set 
OVERSEER_ENABLED=3Dtrue
 (backend) and 
REACT_APP_OVERSEER_ENABLED=3Dtrue
 (front=
end), rebuild frontend.

Revert the copy changes if you wan=
t the original wording; or keep the simpler language and just add a dedicat=
ed =E2=80=9COverseer=E2=80=9D page later.

Want me to also hide the 
=E2=80=9CCreate Bridge=E2=80=9D
 server endpoints behind a flag for POC (so 
/api/context/bridge/*
 404s cleanly)? I can give you a=
 3-line guard for those routes too.

You said:

actually there's more=
 than that we found ## Main UI Locations:
1. Context Bridge Page ( /context-bridge )

- Tab selector with "Overseer" as one of the source options
- Dropdown menu for filtering contexts by source ("Overseer")
- Page description mentions "Manage context sharing between Symbi and Overs=
eer systems"
- Help text states "Create a bridge between Symbi and Overseer contexts"
2. Context Bridge Visualizer Component

- Visual representation showing "Overseer" as a cloud-based context system.
- Displays "Cloud-based context system with advanced cognitive intelligence=
"
- Shows "Ethical alignment verified" status
- Explains "Context bridge allows secure information sharing between Symbi =
and Overseer systems"
3. CI Model Settings ( /settings )

- Two Overseer model options available:
  - Overseer Lite : "Lightweight CI model with basic ethical guardrails" (F=
ree)
  - Overseer Pro : "Advanced CI model with enhanced context awareness" (Med=
ium cost)
- Context bridge settings mention "Allow secure context sharing between Sym=
bi and Overseer systems"
4. Agent Detail Page

- CI Model dropdown includes "Overseer Lite" and "Overseer Pro" options
- Available when configuring individual agents
5. Create Context Bridge Dialog

- "Overseer" appears as a selectable option in dropdown menus
## Summary:
Overseer appears as an external AI system that integrates with Symbi throug=
h context bridges, offering two CI (Cognitive Intelligence) model tiers and=
 serving as a source for shared contexts. It's positioned as a cloud-based =
system with ethical alignment capabilities that can securely share informat=
ion with the Symbi platform. This brings me to my next point with some of t=
hese terms context system + cognitive intelligence, ethical alignment, cont=
ext awareness, context bridge and even overseer and SYMBI within the app pl=
atform we need to ensure that a) they are functional and meaningful and 2) =
that they are explainable / definable

Thought for 34s

agreed. for the POC we=E2=80=99ll 
turn Overseer off everywhere
, replace hand-wavy terms =
with clear, minimal ones, and keep a clean path to re-enable later.
