SYMBI

What:

 SYMBI is the system that r=
uns your assistants, coordinates multi=E2=80=91agent rounds, and maintains =
a tamper=E2=80=91evident ledger of what happened and why.

Why:

 To produce helpful outcomes=
 while keeping actions auditable and safe.

Conversation=

What:

 A running thread w=
ith an assistant.

Why:

 Keeps messages, context, an=
d trust signals in one place.

Note:

 Each conversation has a 

Session ID

 like 

conv:<id>

 used by the ledger and APIs.

Assistant

What:

 A configured model plus instructions (and optional tools).

You can:

 pick a model, edit inst=
ructions, and chat using the 

most recent

 assistant.

Roundtable (Bridge)

What:

 Ask multiple agents to propose sol=
utions; SYMBI ranks and returns a recommendation.

Why:

 Different agents have diffe=
rent strengths; Roundtable compares them.

Receipts:

 After a run, SYMBI wri=
tes a 

Proposal Receipt

 to the le=
dger recording the agents considered, scores, and the chosen plan.

Ledger

What:

 =
An append=E2=80=91only log that links every entry with the previous entry=
=E2=80=99s hash.

Why:

 If entries are altered, ver=
ification fails.

You can:

 view events, verify int=
egrity, and export.

Trust Overlays (Chips)

What:

 Compact signals drawn from the =
ledger and heuristics.

Pivot:

 Detected change in stance/register after =
sensitive content.

Change %:

 Magnitude of the shift.

Sta=
nce:

 e.g., co=E2=80=91creator =E2=86=92 clinician.

Row hash:

 Short has=
h of the event for integrity reference.

Why:

 Makes dynamics visible at a=
 glance.

Context

=
What:

 Sources SYMBI may reference (links, notes, arti=
facts).

Not:

 It=E2=80=99s not model memo=
ry.

Use:

 Add or tag items so SYMBI c=
an pull relevant context when responding.

Context Capsu=
le

What:

 A small, session=
=E2=80=91scoped memory you control: goals, tone preferences, constraints, t=
ags, notes.

How used:

 SYMBI prepends a capsu=
