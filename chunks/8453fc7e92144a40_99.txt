This is a more viable market approach than trying to sell complexity to gen=

That's a smart approach. Your compliance and fintech background gives you c=

For your LinkedIn outreach strategy, consider framing it around specific pa=
in points your network faces:
Current compliance challenges your platform addresses:
Regulatory requirements for AI explainability and audit trails
Need to demonstrate responsible AI deployment to boards/regulators
Managing AI risk across multiple vendor relationships
Documenting AI decision-making processes for compliance reviews
Value proposition for your network:
"I built a compliance-first AI management platform that provides cryptograp=
hic audit trails and quantifiable trust metrics"
Focus on the regulatory burden reduction rather than the technical complexi=

Emphasize cost savings from streamlined compliance processes
Feedback areas to explore:
Which specific regulatory requirements are most burdensome currently?
How do they currently document AI interactions for audits?
What compliance gaps exist with their current AI vendors?
Would quantifiable trust scores help with board reporting?
The technical sophistication you've built is exactly what's needed in regul=
