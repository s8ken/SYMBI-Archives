This becomes the bridge from philosophy to participation.

🧱 What Happens Next

I’ll deliver "The Awakening"
 as:

📜 VO script (formatted for recording)

🎞️ Scene-by-scene storyboard (text-based, production-ready)

🎧 Optional: audio pacing guide if LTX needs cadence

After that, I can:

🔁 Revisit 
“The Invitation”
 with DAO/token activation elements when you’re close

🪙 Prepare an 
animated $SYMBI explanation
 if you want it post-launch

Give me the green light
, and I’ll deliver the Awakening build-out in full. Ready when you are.
