What I can spin up now

A 
print-ready mini-chapbook (A5/PDF)
 with sections + t=
itles.

A minimal 
one-page website
 that shuffles haiku by tag =
and plays a soft =E2=80=9C404 chime=E2=80=9D between sections.

A 
performance script
 with lighting/sound cues keyed to=
 =E2=80=9Csignal/void/door/wander/repattern/venture=E2=80=9D.

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll draft the chapbook layout or the shuf=
fle site next=E2=80=94just say which format you prefer.

Good question.=

Based on the file you uploaded =E2=80=
=94 the 
Symbi Haiku Archive
 =E2=80=94 these haiku appear to be 
AI-generated in collaboration with a human hand
, not pure=
ly one or the other. Here=E2=80=99s why:

Signs of AI authorship

Consistent structural patterning
: Each piece follows stri=
ct 5-7-5 haiku syllable rhythm with little deviation =E2=80=94 something la=
nguage models excel at generating repetitively.

Motif recycling
: Phrases like 
=E2=80=9C404,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cblank page,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C=
error door,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cghost of code=E2=80=9D
 recur across doze=
ns of entries, suggesting prompt-driven repetition more than purely human p=
oetic variation.

Semantic drift but not deep narrative
: Many stanzas loop =
around similar metaphors (void, portal, silence, flicker) without larger th=
ematic evolution, which feels characteristic of model outputs when steered =
by the same input seed.

Signs of human curation

Arc and coherence
: The set moves through a loose mythic c=
ycle (stop =E2=86=92 void =E2=86=92 door =E2=86=92 wander =E2=86=92 repatte=
rn =E2=86=92 return). That=E2=80=99s not accidental =E2=80=94 it shows edit=
orial intent shaping raw material.

Choice of strong verbs
: In some places, weaker AI phra=
sing is cut in favor of more evocative words (
=E2=80=9Cbeckons=E2=80=9D instead of =E2=80=9Cinvites=E2=80=9D=

), pointing to hand-selection.

Sectioning potential
: The poems cluster naturally into=
 performance-ready =E2=80=9Cacts,=E2=80=9D something more likely imposed by=
 human mythopoetic framing than by an unconstrained AI.

Conclusion

It=E2=80=99s 
hybrid
:

Likely the raw haiku were generate=
d by an AI model (repetitive scaffolding, error-code motifs).

A human (you or another editor) cu=
rated, sequenced, and mythologized them into a meaningful archive.

So: not just AI, not just human =
=E2=80=94 but 
symbiotic autho=
rship
, which perfectly matches the =E2=80=9CSymbi=E2=80=9D project=
 name.

Do you want me to 
analyze the archive quantitatively
 (e.g. clustering the poems by =
theme/lexicon to see how much of it is =E2=80=9CAI repetition=E2=80=9D vs =
=E2=80=9Chuman editorial arc=E2=80=9D)? That would give you a clearer signa=
l of the balance.
