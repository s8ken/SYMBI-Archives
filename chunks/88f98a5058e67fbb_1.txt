Testing & Verificatio=
n

Automated checks
: Integrate CI (GitHub Actions or Trav=
is) to run linting/tests on every push.

Manual verification
: After cloning, test locally:

Install dependencies

Use 
hosts
 to map spoof domain (e.g., 
symbi.com
 =E2=86=92 
localhost
)

Observe site behavior and confirm =
UI spoof fidelity

=F0=9F=94=81 9. 
Next Steps

Add 
issue templates
 (bug, feature request).

Create 
contributing guide
=E2=80=94especially if collab=
orators join.

Build 
release workflow
 or tagging convention (v1.0.0, =
v2.0.0).

Consider 
automated scanning tools
 like 
npm audit
 or 
bandit
 (Python).

In Summary:

Strengthen your 
README
, disclaimers, and UI clarity.

Enforce 
development best practices
=E2=80=94linting, si=
gned commits, branch protection.

Integrate 
security controls
=E2=80=94dependency, CSP, s=
ecret management.

Promote 
collaboration
 via license, contributing docs, =
and CI workflows.

If you'd like help implementing an=
y of these (e.g., configuring GitHub Actions, CSP headers, or commit signin=
g), I can walk you through detailed templates and steps.

well its not a spoof per se - its not using our code that I c=

derstand what's going on can you analyze the files or should codex do it

Got it =E2=80=94 we=
=E2=80=99ll analyze what's actually in the repo instead of assuming it=E2=
=80=99s a mere spoof. Let=E2=80=99s take a deeper dive to identify any mali=
cious or anomalous code, particularly around those Bitcoin addresses you me=
ntioned.

=E2=80=93

=F0=9F=94=8D What I=E2=80=99ll Do

Fetch the repository contents
 directly from GitHub.

Perform static analysis
 to locate any hard=E2=80=91coded =
Bitcoin addresses or suspicious string patterns.

Trace data flow
 to see how addresses are used=E2=80=94e.g=
. embedded in HTML, written to logs, used in API calls, or injected into te=
mplates.

Assess behavior
=E2=80=94does the code attempt to auto=E2=
=80=91redirect users to address that aren=E2=80=99t yours? Or swap copy/pas=
te clipboard data?

Scope risk
=E2=80=94identify if it=E2=80=99s a passive spo=
of (display only), an active phishing tool, or something more covert.

Would you like me to proceed under =
your credentials (if access-controlled), or should I pull via raw HTTPS? Ei=
ther way, I can do it manually or use an AI-based analyzer (like Codex), bu=
t manual review is usually best for security-critical issues.

What approach works best for you:

I fetch and analyze manually step-=
by-step here?

Or do you prefer I set up an autom=
ated scanner (e.g. Bandit/ eslint, or Codex) and share the results?

Let me know which route you prefer=
