Before Going Public or Reporting:

=E2=9C=94 Make your repo private (=
if it isn't yet)

=E2=9C=94 Store this metadata + al=
l scripts as evidence

=E2=9C=94 Confirm whether you cont=
rol 
any
 of the IDs (UA, ENS,=
 etc.)

=F0=9F=9A=A8 
If Malicious Intent Is Confirmed

You can now file:

GitHub Abuse Report
 =E2=80=94 for fake SYMBI impersona=
tion

Squarespace Takedown
 =E2=80=94 via support with the si=
te handle

Google Analytics Abuse Report

Would you like:

A 
takedown report template
 for any of these services?

Help contacting Squarespace or Git=
Hub Security?

Blockchain forensics on the wallet=
 address(es) used?

You're in a strong position now to expose this safely and respo=
nsibly. Let me know how you'd like to move next.

lol Repo Location: Presumably s8ken/symb=
i-spoof-site - why do you think I named It spoof site Lol just ignore that =
repo thats where I put the evidence

=F0=9F=98=82 Got it =E2=80=94 crystal clear now.

You're 
not spoofing
 anything. You're the one 
exposing
 the spoof =E2=80=94 and the rep=
o 
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
 i=
s 
just a sandbox vault
=
 where you're collecting and analyzing malicious assets.

That "spoof-site" repo name? Pure ir=
ony. Understood. I=E2=80=99ll stop treating it as the origin and treat it p=
roperly as 
the evidence locker
.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Updated Understanding

You 
collected
 the malicious website's assets (HTML, JS, et=
c.)

You're 
storing them
 in your own GitHub repo to collaborate=
 with AI/code tools

The 
repo is not hosting
 or serving the actual spoof site =
=E2=80=94 just analyzing it

=E2=9C=85 Action Items Going Forwar=
d

Treat 
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
 as 
a forensic workspace

Flag all references to external infr=
astructure (Squarespace site, GTM IDs, wallet addresses, etc.)

Keep it 
private until you're ready to publish or report

If you want, I can help you rename t=
he repo or generate a more disarming README like:

=
markdown

Copy code

# symbi-fraud-evid=
ence-vault (Private Forensics Repository)

> =F0=9F=94=8D This is NOT a liv=
e website. It contains archived files collected from a spoofed instance of =
the SYMBI brand for forensic analysis only.

If you're ready, I can:

Help you build 
an attribution map
 across these breadc=
rumbs

Draft 
disclosure templates
 to GitHub, Squarespace, Goo=
gle, or a security entity

Or prep a cleaned 
public report
 for awareness or legal=
 action

Whatever next step you choose =E2=80=94 I'm with you. Just say =
the word.
