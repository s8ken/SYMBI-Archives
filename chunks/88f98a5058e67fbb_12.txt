Placeholder or sample email addresses also appear in minified vendor files:

Several JavaScript files repeat the same license headers and links=E2=80=94=
for example evmAsk.js, phantom.js, solana.js, and sui.js all contain the em=
n178@gmail.com author email and the GitHub links above

The repository itself was cloned from GitHub:

Sample content =E2=80=94 not real senders

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
None of these imply authors are involved in =
fraud
 =E2=80=94 they are likely bundled in by someone assembling a=
 composite front-end.

=F0=9F=A7=AA Pattern Observed

Identical license blocks repeated =
across 
btc.js
, 
evmAsk.js
, 
phantom.js
, 
sui.js
, and 
so=
lana.js

No actual 
npm
 metadata like 
package-lock.json
 or 
node_modules
 =E2=80=94 this was likely a 
manual bundle
 or partial archive

Suggests a 
flat static site
 with selected crypto-targe=
ting JS

=F0=9F=A7=B1 Conclusion: Not Orig=
inal Code, But Possibly Weaponized Bundling

Most JS content is 
legitimate open-source

But 
combined and repurposed
 in a 
suspicious UI flow
 to:

Collect crypto wallet info

Inject attacker-controlled wallet =
addresses

Without transparent attribution or=
 context =3D =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
potential fraud vector

=F0=9F=94=92 What This Means For =
Reporting

You now have:

Clear evidence
 the attacker did not write most code

But used it in a 
misleading context
 to collect crypto =
wallet data

Possible 
license violations
 if attribution is removed =
in parts

Reasonable grounds to report the s=
ite=E2=80=99s function to:

GitHub (if cloned)

Squarespace (if hosted)

Google (tracking ID)
