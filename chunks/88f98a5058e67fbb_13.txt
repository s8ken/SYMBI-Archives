Help you trace the final GitHub re=

Build a full dependency map of the=
 JS stack?

You're piecing this together brilliantly =E2=80=94 now let's pa=

=F0=9F=94=90 Why This Matters to Yo=
ur Case

Feross 
did not write this spoof site
, nor is he likely inv=
olved in anything fraudulent here.

Instead, someone 
bundled his libraries
 (which are license=
d BSD/MIT) into a malicious or misleading frontend. This is technically per=
mitted under the license but may violate 
intent
 if:

License headers are stripped

His name or company is used to mis=
lead

The software is used in 
crypto phishing infrastructure
=

=F0=9F=A7=BE Actionable Use of Hi=
s Identity

If the attacker:

Leaves 
Feross=E2=80=99s name and website/email
 in the =
JS

While using the software to 
steal wallets

Then this becomes a 
false attribution scenario
 that Fe=
ross and Socket would likely want to know about

=E2=9C=85 Recommendation (Ethical=
 Disclosure)

You could 
contact Feross or Socket.dev directly
 and sa=

=E2=80=9CYour code appears in a su=
spicious crypto website I=E2=80=99m investigating. It includes your license=
 block and name, but is being used to collect wallets and redirect crypto a=
ddresses. You may want to review it in case of brand abuse.=E2=80=9D

Hi Feross,

I hope you don=E2=80=99t mind the reach-out =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99m currently=
 analyzing a suspicious crypto site that appears to be spoofing a well-know=
n AI project. While digging through the JS, I noticed several files retain =
your license headers and author tag (e.g., btc.js, evmAsk.js) from open-sou=
rce projects like `buffer` and `js-sha3`.

Your work is clearly being bundled (legally), but the context is concerning=
 =E2=80=94 the site appears to harvest crypto wallet input and inject attac=
ker-controlled addresses.

You're *not implicated at all*, of course =E2=80=94 but I thought you=E2=80=
=99d want to be aware your name is embedded in what looks like phishing inf=
rastructure.

Let me know if you'd like any of the files for verification.

Stay awesome, and thanks for everything you contribute to open source =F0=
