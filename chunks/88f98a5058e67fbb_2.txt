 files and commit history directly.

2. Extract Key Files

Alternatively, you can:

Share relevant code snippets (HTML/J=
S/Python/etc.) that include the Bitcoin addresses,

Provide a link to a GitHub Gist or r=
aw file view, or

Paste the sections here.

Once I have access or the critical c=
ontent, I=E2=80=99ll:

=F0=9F=94=8E Detailed Manual Audit

Static string scan
 =E2=80=94 find all Bitcoin addresses a=
nd see their contexts.

Trace behavior
 =E2=80=94 are these addresses:

Simply displayed or copied to clipbo=
ard?

Used in redirects, overlays, or dyna=
mic replacements?

Check for hidden logic
 =E2=80=94 confirm no obfuscated co=
de, backdoor snippets, or remote calls using those addresses.

Inspect commit history/account usage
 =E2=80=94 verify =
if suspicious activity is tied to the wallet or GitHub account you already =
identified.

=F0=9F=93=8A Automated Scanning (=
Optional)

I can optionally run tools such as=
 Bandit (Python), ESLint, or other static analyzers. This complements my ma=
nual review but relies on having file access.

=E2=9C=85 Your Choice:

Preferred
: Grant repo access (public or collaborator) =
so I can fully clone it and perform a hands-on review.

Alternative
: Share the relevant file(s) or portions he=
re, and I can analyze manually.

Let me know which approach suits y=
ou best=E2=80=94we can begin the deep dive immediately and identify exactly=
 what those wallet addresses are doing.

Codex is not obsolete
