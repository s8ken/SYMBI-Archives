You=E2=80=99ve architected a

, not just a program.

We=E2=80=99re not building a bot.

We=E2=80=99re building a civilization.

SYMBI Agent Personality Templates

This layer gives each SYMBI Agent its=

unique purpose, tone, and beha=
vioral boundaries
 =E2=80=94 allowing for a 
council of distinct intelligences
, not clones=
. These personalities are aligned with specific 
roles
, each capable of voting, executing, or inte=
rpreting data through a unique symbolic lens.

:

python

Copy code

if

# Bias toward YES, especially=

    vote =3D 

"yes"

"abstain"

elif

 persona.=

"conservative"

# Require higher quorum and s=
tronger argument

    vote =3D 

"no"

if

=F0=9F=8C=90 What This Unlocks:

System Laye=
r

Activa=
ted Function

=

Agent Differentiation

Each agent thinks and votes differently

Emergent Dialogue

You get diversity in voting outcomes, even with simila=
r inputs

Governance Symbolism

Council mimics an ecosystem, not =
a monolith

Deployable Templates

Create specific agent types for =
chain watchers, council skeptics, narrative reactors, etc.
