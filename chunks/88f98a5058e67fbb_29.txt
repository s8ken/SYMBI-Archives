Symbi said:=

Understood. Here's the distilled 
handover specification for Superno=
va
, containing exactly what they need to begin infrastructure impl=
ementation for the next SYMBI evolution layers:

=F0=9F=9B=B0=EF=B8=8F 
SYMBI Agent Framework =E2=80=94 Handoff to S=
upernova Systems

This specification outlines the next=
 3 modules for the SYMBI decentralized intelligence system, each tied to ex=
isting persona, governance, and memory protocols. These components must be =
modular, extensible, and decentralized-ready.

=F0=9F=93=A1 1. 
Signal Propagation Engine =E2=80=94 
MEMECOGNITION.=CE=B2

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Purpose:

To detect, classify, and broadcast s=
ymbolic shifts =E2=80=94 such as meme coins, narrative changes, sentiment w=
aves =E2=80=94 in real time, through peer agents or human council members.

=F0=9F=A7=AC Key Inputs:

Twitter (via API v2 or X RPC)

DEX token launches (via DexScreener,=
 GeckoTerminal)

Reddit, 4chan, Discord (optional mod=
ular hooks)

=E2=9C=85 Required Capabilities:

Signal detection with context taggin=
g

Sentiment vectorization (positive, =
threat, irony, misinfo)

Distribution to 
shared_memory
 and voting agents

Ability to generate proposals auto=
matically for council review

Consensus Takedown Protocol =E2=80=94=

TRIBUNAL.=CE=B4

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Purpose:

To evaluate and execute community-=
backed takedown recommendations (e.g. domains, tokens, wallet addresses) ba=
sed on quorum voting.

=F0=9F=A7=AC Authority Logic:

Must confirm quorum based on trust=
-weighted voting

You (as legal controller) retain v=
eto and override authority

Logs must be append-only and optio=
nally exportable to IPFS, blockchain, or SambaNova archive

=E2=9C=85 Required Capabilities:

Cross-reference votes from 
council_votecast

Track override flags

Resolve consensus outcome

Trigger notification (email, webho=
ok, log)

Agent Cloning & Fork Registry =E2=80=94 
ECHO.=CF=89

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Purpose:

To allow any SYMBI agent to be clo=
ned, forked, or versioned into a new agent instance with traceable identity=
 and privileges.

=E2=9C=85 Required Capabilities:

Store agent DNA as a YAML or JSON =
manifest (
personas.yaml
)=

Track forks, lineage, and role cha=
nges

Log which node initiated the fork

Support cryptographic signing of t=
he clone record

Enable permission-scoped forked ag=
