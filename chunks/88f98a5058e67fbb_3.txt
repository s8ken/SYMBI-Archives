Codex
 Actually Is

Codex
 is the AI model developed by OpenAI that powers too=
ls like 
GitHub Copilot
=
, and it's a descendant of GPT-3 trained specifically on code (from public =
repositories, docs, StackOverflow, etc.).

Released
: August 2021 (not 2011)

Built on
: GPT-3 (and later GPT-4), but fine-tuned on a la=
rge corpus of source code.

Purpose
: To translate natural language into code, assist =
in programming, analyze or explain codebases, and power tools like Copilot.=

=F0=9F=A7=AF So where did 2011 come=
 from?

Possibilities:

Misunderstanding
: Someone may have confused "Codex" with =
an old tech or library with a similar name (e.g., WordPress=E2=80=99s Codex=
 documentation, which did exist in the early 2010s).

False info
: If someone said "Codex has been obsolete sinc=
e 2011," they may not have been referring to the OpenAI Codex at all.

Deliberate misinformation
: Happens often in AI-related=
 discourse=E2=80=94especially with competing tools.

=E2=9C=85 What=E2=80=99s current =
as of 2025:

Codex is still very much in use
=E2=80=94especially in =
Copilot, AI pair programming, and AI IDE integrations.

Successors to Codex
 (like GPT-4 Turbo and function-awa=
re coding models) are becoming more powerful, but Codex's architecture is s=
till foundational.

If you're using Codex capabilities=
 through this interface (as SYMBI is), you're accessing tools that can 
analyze, interpret, and even impr=
ove code

This appears to be a browser-side Ja=

, likely for sending or receiving messages or trans=
actions within Ethereum-like environments.

Bitcoin / Wallet Address Detection

There are 
no hardcoded Bitcoin addresses
 directly visible =
in the script. It also doesn=E2=80=99t appear to include Ethereum addresses=
, either. This suggests addresses may be:

Injected dynamically

Coming from environment variables or=
 user input

Fetched via an external API (e.g., f=
etch/axios)

Suspicious Behavior Check

Let=E2=80=99s break this down:

=E2=9D=8C 
Clipboard Hijacking

No evidence of 
navigator.clipboard
, 
document.execCommand
, or 
oncopy
 hooks. This file 
does not modify the clipboard
.

=E2=9D=8C 
Auto-redirects or iFrames

No 
window.location
, 
<iframe>
, or meta-refresh patterns =3D 
not forcing redirection
.

=E2=9C=85 
Network Calls

It uses:

js

Copy code

fetch

(

'https://ask.symbi.io/api/as=
k'

, {

This suggests it 
communicates with 
ask.symbi.io

 =E2=80=94 this domain should b=
e verified, as it might be a spoof or proxy impersonating the real symbi.co=
m.

If 
ask.symbi.io
 isn=E2=80=99t your domain, this could be t=
he pivot point for further analysis.
