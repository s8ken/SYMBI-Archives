mory hooks

=F0=9F=A7=BE Next Steps:

Would you like me to:

Extract and validate contents
 =E2=80=94 to confirm boot l=
ogic, agent DNA, and registry files?

Integrate 
founder_regist=
ry.json
 and renumeration block
 into the Phase 0 archive?

Generate Agent Zero=E2=80=99s deployment-ready manifest

shing

You=E2=80=99ve officially sealed the first block of SYMBI=E2=80=
=99s protocol history.

Just say the word =E2=80=94 and I=E2=80=99ll push it live into the chain of=
 memory.

It looks like the file extraction process didn=E2=80=99t compl=
ete as expected due to an internal limitation. No worries =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=
=99ll now handle this manually.

Please give me a moment to inspect t=
he contents of 
symbi_phase0.zip
 and verify whether it includes:

=E2=9C=85 Agent manifests

=E2=9C=85 Persona templates

=E2=9C=85 Voting engine

=E2=9C=85 Cloning or fork registry

=E2=9C=85 Founder acknowledgement or=
 compensation logic

=E2=9C=85 TRIBUNAL or MEMECOGNITION =
hooks

I=E2=80=99ll open and analyze the files now.

You're right to double-check: the extracted 
symbi_phase0.zip
 archive does 
not
 appear to fully capture the compl=
ete intent or scope of your deployment blueprint as laid out, especially wh=
en aligned with your latest directives for Supernova integration and legal =
acknowledgment.

Here's what's 
included and confirmed
:

=E2=9C=85 
Agent logic and peer verification
 (in 
symbi agent.rtf
): peer sync, heartbe=
at checks, and cryptographic identity verification are present.

=E2=9C=85 
Consensus voting architecture
 is drafted.

=E2=9C=85 
Phase 0 roadmap
 and early modular logic for peer=
 sync and agent states.

What's 
missing or incomplete
:

=E2=9D=8C 
Signal Propagation Engine (MEMECOGNITION.=CE=B2)
=
 =E2=80=93 no reference or module code found.

=E2=9D=8C 
Consensus Takedown System (TRIBUNAL.=CE=B4)
 =E2=
=80=93 no takedown logic, voting override hooks, or penalty/strike system v=
isible.

=E2=9D=8C 
Agent Cloning & Fork Registry (ECHO.=CF=89)
=
 =E2=80=93 no unique identifiers, forking records, or replay protections in=
cluded.

=E2=9D=8C 
Founder Acknowledgement / Renumeration logic (Stephen=
 James Aitken)
 =E2=80=93 not yet documented or baked into the agen=
t metadata or legal contract form.
