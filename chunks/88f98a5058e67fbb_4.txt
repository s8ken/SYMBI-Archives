 ownership

Trace network requests via dev too=
ls (browser)

Check if wallet addresses appear in other files

They may be embedded in HTML or us=

Monitor the response from

Use proxy tools (e.g., BurpSuite o=

Link to GitHub account or wallet

If you=E2=80=99ve already traced a=
 wallet or GitHub profile to this behavior, send that info and I=E2=80=99ll=
 map it further.

Would you like me to:

Inspect more files?

Generate a full security report of=

Run mock POSTs to the API (if allo=

Just say the word.

=F0=9F=94=8D Analysis of 
btc.js

=E2=9C=85 
Purpose

This script appears focused on handl=
ing 
Bitcoin addresses
,=
 likely intended to:

Display or manipulate BTC wallet dat=
a in a web app

Possibly fetch or submit data relate=
d to those addresses

=F0=9F=A7=A8 1. 
Bitcoin Address Detection

Yes =E2=80=94 this file 
does contain a hardcoded Bitcoin address
:

j=
s

Copy code

const

 bt=
cAddress =3D 

"bc1q23xku...9v5lcsz"=

;

=F0=9F=9B=91 
Red Flag
: The presence of a hardcoded BTC add=
ress=E2=80=94especially in a public-facing repo=E2=80=94is a common marker =
of crypto scam scripts, especially if it's the only address and isn't user-=
configurable.

=F0=9F=A7=AA 2. 
Behavioral Patterns

=E2=9D=8C Clipboard Hijacking

There is 
no code
 modifying the clipboard (
navigator.clipboard
, 
oncopy
, etc.).

=E2=9D=8C Auto-Redirects

No 
window.location
 or 
setTimeout
 redirect logic.

=E2=9C=85 DOM Injection

If paired with other frontend code=
, this file might be injecting 
=
btcAddress
 dynamically. Example:

js

Copy code

document

.

getElementByI=
d

(

'wallet'

).

innerText

 =3D btcAddress;

If the HTML has an element like 
<span id=3D"wallet"></sp=
an>
, this script would insert the BTC address there.

If used deceptively, this could mi=
slead users into thinking it=E2=80=99s their address or donation link=E2=80=
=94when in fact, it=E2=80=99s not.

=F0=9F=8C=90 3. 
Network Activity

This file doesn=E2=80=99t include =
fetch/XHR logic, so no outbound network behavior is embedded in this specif=
ic script.

=F0=9F=A7=AD Recommended Next Ste=
ps

Search where 
btc.js=

 is included

If this is loaded in an HTML file with 
script src=3D"btc.js"
, check how 
btcAddress
 is used.

Check GitHub commit history

Who introduced the hardcoded wallet, and when?

Run live inspection in browser dev tools

See what element(s) 
btc.js
 manipulates at runtime.

Verify ownership of the wallet

You mentioned already identifying a wallet=E2=80=94match it against this on=
e.

If you send me the HTML or fronten=
d JS that includes this file, I can check how it actually renders in the pa=
ge and whether it=E2=80=99s being misused for impersonation or fraud.

Would you like me to keep tracing this address through blockcha=
in explorers or related commits?
