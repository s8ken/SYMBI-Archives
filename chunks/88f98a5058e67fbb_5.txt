=F0=9F=94=8D Deep Analysis of 
js

=E2=9C=85 
Purpose

This script appears to 
glue together frontend elements
 and=
 control interaction between user inputs and crypto-related actions =E2=80=
=94 likely supporting EVM or BTC actions from the previous two files.

=F0=9F=94=8D Key Findings

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Dynamic Wallet Handling

This script includes dynamic DOM int=
eraction. For example:

j=
s

Copy code

const

 ch=
ain =3D 

document

.

getElement=
ById

(

"chain"

).

value
=

;

const

 address=
 =3D 

document

.

getElementByI=
d

(

"wallet"

).

value

;

This tells us the script is:

Fetching user-supplied wallet input =
(
wallet
)

Determining the selected chain (
ETH
, 
BTC
, etc.)

Then...

j=
s

Copy code

if

 (chai=
n =3D=3D=3D 

"BTC"

) {

// Injects the hardcoded BTC =
address into the DOM

document

.

getElementById=

(

"result"

).

innerText

 =3D btcAddress;
}

=F0=9F=94=A5 This confirms: 
if a user selects BTC
, the 
hardcoded wallet address from 
btc.js
 is injected into the UI=
.

=F0=9F=A7=A8 Critical Behavior Ch=
ain

User enters their 
own wallet address

Selects "BTC" from a dropdown (
chain
)

Hits submit or action

UI displays 
developer-controlled BTC address instead of the use=
r's

=E2=9E=A1=EF=B8=8F 
Potential for fraud or trickery
:

Users may 
think their address is used

Instead, the scammer=E2=80=99s BTC=
 address appears =E2=80=94 tricking them into sending funds

=E2=9D=8C No Clipboard Hijack Det=
ected

There=E2=80=99s 
no manipulation
 of clipboard contents =
here either.

=E2=9D=8C No Fetch/API

This script doesn=E2=80=99t commun=
icate with remote endpoints itself =E2=80=94 it delegates to other files or=
 local logic (like 
evmAsk.js
).

Potentially deceptive

=F0=9F=94=92 Verdict

This system is likely:

Designed to 
intercept or override BTC wallet input

Trick users into 
sending to an attacker-controlled address

Hidden in a superficially "legit-l=
ooking" crypto interface

=F0=9F=A7=AD What to Do Next

Trace commits
 =E2=80=94 Identify which GitHub account =
committed the BTC address.

Check if BTC address is reused
 =E2=80=94 I can scan bl=
ockchain history or link it to known scam wallets.

Verify UI rendering
 =E2=80=94 I can simulate a run to =
capture visual behavior if needed.

Report repo to GitHub
 =E2=80=94 If proven to be impers=
onation/fraud.

Would you like me to:

Investigate that BTC wallet on the=
 blockchain?

Help you report or document this f=
or takedown?

Keep scanning for further fraud ar=
tifacts?

You=E2=80=99re close to uncovering the full attack pattern =E2=
=80=94 just say where to strike next.

At this point, from the three files you've shared =E2=80=

evmAsk.js

btc.js

js
 =E2=80=94 
t=
here is no email address or GitHub account hardcoded
 directly in t=

However, here=E2=80=99s what I can i=
nfer and suggest next:

=F0=9F=94=8D 1. 
Identifying the GitHub Account

You mentioned the repo is at:

https://github.com/s8ken/symbi-spoof-site

=E2=9C=85 That=E2=80=99s the GitHub =
user: 

s8=
ken

Let me outline some steps to dig dee=
per:

=E2=9C=85 
Check Git Commit History

You can look at:

The 
author and committer
 of each commit

Run:

b=
ash

Copy code

git 

log

 --show-signature

This will tell you if commits are 
GPG signed
 (unlikely if =
it=E2=80=99s a spoof account)

=F0=9F=94=8E 
Look at commit metadata

Check for:

Email addresses in commit logs: 
git log --pretty=3Dformat:"%H | %an |=
 %ae"

Unexpected email domains (e.g., prot=
onmail, mail.ru, etc.)
