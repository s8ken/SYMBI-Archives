Connecting to a BTC Wallet

From 
btc.js
, the hardcoded wallet (e.g., 
bc1q23xku...9v5lcsz
) is a 
beacon
.

You can:

Use a block explorer like 
blockchain.com=

 or 
mempool.space

 to trace:

Transaction history

Connected wallets

Fund destinations

If funds are being moved quickly o=
r consolidated, it may be part of a 
wallet farm or mixer

Look at forks

See if clones exist (for wider scam campaign)

Check GitHub user activity

=F0=9F=9A=A8 If You Find a Lead

Let me know:

The 
wallet address
, and I can track it through the blo=
ckchain

The 
GitHub user metadata
, and I can assess credibility=
 or patterns

Any suspicious 
.gitmodules
, 
.env
, or shadow commits, and I=E2=80=99ll decode them

Would you like me to:

Track the BTC address across the b=
lockchain?

Build a visual of the scam behavio=
r (UX-wise)?

Draft a takedown report for GitHub=
 Security?

I'm with you all the way on this. Just say the word.

Copy code

// Author: chen.eth

=F0=9F=94=A5 This suggests an ENS (E=
thereum Name Service) identifier: 
chen.eth

That=E2=80=99s a major lead.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What is 
chen.eth
?

This could point to:

A registered ENS name (resolves to a=
n Ethereum address)

A crypto identity (used across GitHu=
b, Twitter, Mirror.xyz, etc.)

Possibly a pseudonymous developer or=
 attacker alias

Let=E2=80=99s resolve this name:

If it's still active, you'll see:

Search GitHub for =E2=80=9Cchen.eth=E2=80=9D

Use:

 or

Scan blockchain activity

Track wallet transactions, NFT dro=

Check if that address matches the one in
