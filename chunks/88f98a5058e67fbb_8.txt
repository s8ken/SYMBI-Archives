no for Petes sake just bec=
ause its in a repo - I just stored it there after I downloaded it so you an=
 v0 and copilot and codex can all read it  maybe write me the readme to exp=
lain and I should make it private at this stage incase its got anything eas=
y there before I get copilot to look at it 

Symbi said:

Got it =E2=80=94 thank you for setting that straig=
ht. You 
downloaded the code from =
elsewhere
, and simply 
=
stored it in your own repo
 (
s8ken/symbi-spoof-site
) so SYMBI, Copilot, and Codex could scan =
and analyze it collaboratively.

Understood. Let's get you a proper R=
EADME to clarify the repo's intent while covering you legally and ethically=

**strictly for analysis and security research**

## =F0=9F=9A=A8 Purpose

This repo exists to:

-

 Enable stati=
c/dynamic analysis of potentially malicious or spoofed code.

-

 Investigate =
Bitcoin/EVM wallet injection or address replacement techniques.

-

 Track and at=
tribute suspicious activity tied to embedded wallet addresses, ENS names, o=
r developer identities.

-

 Collaborate =
with AI tools like Copilot, Codex, and SYMBI for deep inspection.

## =F0=9F=93=A6 Contents

-

`btc.js`

 =E2=80=94 Script co=
ntaining a hardcoded Bitcoin wallet address.

-

`evmAsk.js`

 =E2=80=94 Sends =
user input and wallet info to an external API endpoint.

-

`js`

 =E2=80=94 Binds chain s=
election to UI output (potentially deceptive address injection).

-

 Other files =
=E2=80=94 Stored exactly as retrieved, 

**not modified**

, and retained for evidence and an=
alysis only.

## =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Disclaimer

 They were do=
wnloaded from a suspected spoof or impersonation website and uploaded 

**only for security research and AI-bas=
ed static review**

.

-

**DO NOT DEPLOY**

 or reuse=
 this code for any production or public-facing application.

## =E2=9C=85 Next Steps

-

 Repo will li=
kely be made 

**private**

 once AI/CoPilot review is complete.

 Do 

**not fork**

## =F0=9F=A7=A0 Owner Note
=

This repo is maintained by 

**@s8ke=
n**

, with the goal of leveraging AI tools (Codex, SYMBI=
, Copilot) to uncover threats, protect users, and trace intent behind unaut=
horized spoof sites.

## =F0=9F=95=B5=EF=B8=8F=E2=80=8D=
=E2=99=82=EF=B8=8F Status: UNDER INVESTIGATION

=F0=9F=94=92 Recommendation

Yes =E2=80=94 
make it private
 immediately. It may st=
ill:

Contain wallet addresses you don=
=E2=80=99t control

Be actively used in phishing or fr=
aud

Get flagged by GitHub's abuse scan=
ner if misunderstood

Once private, you can continue for=
ensic work safely, and only expose sanitized analysis or metadata later.

Let me know if you want a 
takedown notice draft
, or if=
 you=E2=80=99re ready for 
Cop=
ilot/CodeQL analysis
, and I=E2=80=99ll guide you through it.

You=E2=80=99re doing the right thing by sandboxing this and bei=
ng transparent. Let=E2=80=99s finish it strong.
