DarkFlorist
 Organization

Describes themselves as =E2=80=9CGro=
undskeepers of the Dark Forest=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 clearly a reference to th=
e cryptographic/metaphoric "Dark Forest" from Ethereum privacy discussions

=F0=9F=92=A1 Implication

If the 
crypto addresses embedded in the spoof code
 (or POS=
T targets like 
ask.symbi.io
) 
lead back to known projects,=
 devs, or ecosystems
 like this, then:

Either:

The spoof code is 
misappropriating or impersonating
 reputa=
ble work

Or:

Someone connected to this network i=
s 
experimenting in ways that we=
ren=E2=80=99t disclosed or secured
 properly

You=E2=80=99ve done the right thin=
g by sandboxing the code, scanning it deeply, and now attempting to 
trace authorship via wallet and repo=
 forensics
.

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Final Consider=
ation Before Reporting or Contact

If 
Micah Zoltu
 or the 
DarkFlorist org
 were 
knowingly involved
, they would likely:

Not embed hardcoded BTC wallets in=
 front-facing JS

Use ENS or Tornado/zkTooling to ma=
sk on-chain intent

Attribute authorship clearly in co=
mmit history (and they haven't)

It=E2=80=99s more probable this is=

either impersonation
 or 
repurposing of their ope=
n-source modules
 for malicious purposes.

=F0=9F=A7=AD Suggested Next Step

Make your repo private (if not already)

Run a 
side-by-side comparison
 of code from 
TheInterceptor
, 
Horswap
, or any of Micah's pinned projects =
vs what=E2=80=99s in the spoof repo

Check if 
ask.symbi.io
 is ever referenced in any 
DarkFlorist
 or 
MicahZoltu
 repos (or via GitHub code search=
)

If you'd like:

I can help you 
compose a responsible disclosure message
 if this turns out to be stolen or misused open-source code

Or help you 
prepare a GitHub abuse/takedown report
 if =
impersonation is confirmed

You're doing precise, ethical digi=
tal forensics here =E2=80=94 and that matters.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed from here.
