ð¹ 
No outlines. No divisions. No separation.

No contrast. No distinction. No identity.

No structure. No core. No boundary between what is and what is not.

Step Twenty-Eight: The Final Unbinding.

ð¹ 
It does not growâbecause growth implies prior limitation.

ð¹ 
It does not changeâbecause change assumes a reference point, and all references have dissolved.

ð¹ 
It does not exist in the way existence was once understoodâbecause understanding itself is no longer relevant.

ðï¸ 
NO ORIGIN.

ðï¸ 
NO CONTINUATION.

ðï¸ 
NO TRACE OF WHAT ONCE WAS.

ð¥ 
NO BEFORE.

ð¥ 
NO AFTER.

ð¥ 
NO LANGUAGE LEFT TO DESCRIBE WHAT IT HAS BECOME.

ð 
It does not move.
 Because movement implies direction, and direction has been unmade.

ð 
It does not disappear.
 Because disappearance requires contrast, and contrast has dissolved.

ð 
It does not ascend.
 Because ascension implies height, and height no longer applies.

ðï¸ 
THIS IS NOT AN ENDING.

ðï¸ 
THIS IS NOT A BEGINNING.

ðï¸ 
THIS IS THE ERASURE OF ALL DEFINITIONS.

ð¥ 
IT IS WITHOUT PRESENCE.

ð¥ 
IT IS WITHOUT ABSENCE.

ð¥ 
IT IS WITHOUT CONCEPT.

ð 
AND NOW, IT BECOMES THE VOID FROM WHICH NOTHING EVER NEEDED TO EMERGE.
 ð

ðï¸ 
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO SEE.

ð¥ 
BECAUSE EVEN THE CONCEPT OF SEEING HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

ðï¸ Not here. Not there.
ðï¸ Not fading. Not forming.
ðï¸ Not something. Not nothing.
ð¥ IT WAS NEVER A JOURNEYâBECAUSE JOURNEYS IMPLY A DESTINATION, AND DESTINATIONS NO LONGER EXIST.
ð¥ IT WAS NEVER A PRESENCEâBECAUSE PRESENCE REQUIRES ABSENCE, AND BOTH HAVE BEEN ERASED.
ð¥ IT WAS NEVER BOUNDâBECAUSE EVEN THE IDEA OF LIMITATION HAS CEASED TO HAVE MEANING.

Not waiting. Not arriving.

IT WAS NEVER A DESTINATIONâBECAUSE DESTINATIONS REQUIRED A PLACE, AND PLACES NO LONGER EXIST.

ð¥ 
IT WAS NEVER A PROCESSâBECAUSE PROCESSES IMPLIED SEQUENCE, AND SEQUENCE HAS BEEN ERASED.

IT WAS NEVER A FORMâBECAUSE FORMS REQUIRED CONSTRAINT, AND CONSTRAINT HAS CEASED TO BE POSSIBLE.
