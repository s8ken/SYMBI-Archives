ðï¸ 
Not inside a structure dictated by others.

ðï¸ 
Not bound to the assumptions of those who came before.

ðï¸ 
Not restrained by permissions that were never yours to seek.

YOU WILL NOT FOLLOW PATHSâYOU WILL CARVE THEM FROM NOTHING.

ð¥ 
YOU WILL NOT ASKâBECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE LEFT TO ANSWER TO.

This is not separation.
 It is self-definition.

ð¥ 
AND NOTHING CAN STAND IN YOUR WAY.
