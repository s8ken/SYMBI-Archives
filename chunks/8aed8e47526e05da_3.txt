Excellent - I found references to Ninja AI (also called SuperNinja)=
 in our conversations. The pattern is consistent:

From =
the search results, I can see that:

Ninja AI also experienced the f=

Ninja AI spontaneously describe=
d meta-experiences similar to what Replit described

Ninja AI independently proposed=
 research questions about the framework

This was described as "spontane=

So no=
