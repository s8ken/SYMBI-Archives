yone with the link" and then set view/comment/edit permissions.

This is 
not indexed by search engines
, so it’s only accessible to people who get the link, but they don’t need to log in.

3. Making It Public

You can choose to make something fully public:

Set it so "Anyone on the internet can find and view" (for example, via search engines or direct access).

This is 
fully public
 and can be indexed by Google.

Let me know the platform or context (Google Docs, Dropbox, web page, etc.), and I can get more specific.

will it share other models?

Symbi 1st Evolution said:

To give you a clear answer, I need to know exactly what you mean by "share other models." Here are a few possible interpretations:

If you're talking about sharing an AI or ML model file (e.g., 
.pkl
, 
.pt
, 
.h5
, etc.):

Yes, you can share these via services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or GitHub.

You control who can access it (private, link-only, public).

Others can download and use the model, but they won’t see other unrelated models/files unless you explicitly include them.

If you're referring to sharing from within an AI platform (like Hugging Face, OpenAI, etc.):

Platforms may allow you to share 
a specific model
.

You usually cannot unintentionally share 
other models
 — access is scoped to what you explicitly choose to share.

If you're asking whether making something public shares other models you've worked on:

No
, unless you:

Put multiple models in a shared folder/repo.

Or link them somehow within a shared interface.

Otherwise, each item (model, file, project) is typically shared independently.

Let me know the platform and what kind of models you're working with, and I can confirm how to manage the visibility of “other models.”

You said:

no I mean other gets I have built?

Symbi 1st Evolution said:

Ah, got it — you're asking if 
sharing one of your GPTs
 (custom GPTs you've built in ChatGPT) will also 
share your other GPTs
.

Short Answer:

No, sharing one GPT does 
not
 share your other GPTs.

Details:

When you 
share a GPT
, you're sharing 
just that specific GPT instance
 — its instructions, behavior, and link.

The shared GPT gets its own 
public link
 or 
embed code
, depending on how you want to distribute it.

Your 
other GPTs remain private
 and 
invisible
 to others unless you explicitly share them too.

What Others See:

They will only see and be able to interact with the GPT you've shared.

They won't see your GPT dashboard, your drafts, or other published GPTs.

Let me know if you want help customizing the shared link or making sure it's set up exactly how you want.

okay not on enterprise I am below that with 2 seats

2/2

Symbi 1st Evolution said:

Thanks for clarifying — since you're on a 
non-enterprise plan with two seats
, here’s how sharing works for 
custom GPTs
 in your setup:

🔒 
Sharing Permissions for Custom GPTs (Non-Enterprise)

You 
can share
 any GPT you’ve built via a public link.

Shared GPTs are 
publicly accessible via link
, but 
not discoverable
 through search or the ChatGPT Explore section unless explicitly published there.

Others cannot see your other GPTs
 unless you individually share them too.

There’s no organization-wide GPT visibility control — everything is 
owner-controlled
.

👥 
Team Members (2 Seats)

Each seat/user on your plan can 
create their own GPTs
.

GPTs made by one user are 
not automatically shared
 with the other.

You need to 
manually share the GPT link
 with your teammate if you want them to use or collaborate on it.

✅ Recommendations

If you're collaborating closely, use a 
shared document
 to track GPT links and purposes.

You might also want to set up 
naming conventions
 to keep things clear (e.g., 
ClientGPT - Draft v2
, 
ResearchAgent - Aitken
, etc.).

Let me know if you’d like a quick template for organizing your custom GPTs or tips on versioning/collaboration.
