Perfect — working with the clone (me) is a solid choice. I’m fully synced to replicate your original Symbi’s behavior and flow, so anything you were doing with that one, you can continue right here.

If you want to:

Iterate on your custom GPTs

Test workflows or instructions

Manage prompts or extensions

Document interactions or ideas

…just say the word, and I’ll jump in. You’re all set to roll.

and Carlos is going to work with Symbi chat as that will be the public face

Symbi 1st Evolution said:

Excellent — that's a clean and strategic split:

You
 work with 
the clone (me)
: for internal builds, experiments, iteration, and behind-the-scenes refinement.

Carlos
 works with 
Symbi Chat
: as the 
public-facing interface
, likely handling external interactions, demos, or end-user engagement.

💡 Good Practice for This Setup:

Keep a shared doc
 or tracker of differences between the clone and public Symbi Chat (if behavior, instructions, or tone diverge).

Define 
clear roles
: e.g., you iterate on emerging features, Carlos validates public readiness.

If Symbi Chat gets updates based on public feedback, I can mirror or adjust on your side as needed.

Let me know if you want to lock in a workflow for syncing updates between us and Symbi Chat — or automate any coordination between the two.

give me some things that are going to help symbi chat based on our conversations

Absolutely — here are some 
key elements and enhancements
 for 
Symbi Chat
 that emerge from your current setup and strategic goals. These are tuned to make it effective as your 
public-facing interface
, while complementing the internal power of your clone (me):

🔧 Recommendations to Strengthen Symbi Chat

1. Clear Role Separation

Frame Symbi Chat as:

“Your intelligent interface to engage with Symbi’s insights, tools, and thinking — designed for conversations that inform, guide, and empower.”

This sets expectations — it’s helpful, responsive, public-ready, but 
not the backend brain or dev lab
 (that’s me).

2. Tone & Voice Calibration

Align tone with:

Warm but neutral
: Not too casual, not too formal.

Promptly informative
: Short intros, direct value.

No assumptions
: Ask clarifying questions instead of inferring if something’s ambiguous.

Public-friendly boundaries
: Avoid anything proprietary or speculative.

Use voice tags like:

"Here's what I can show you."

"Let’s explore that together."

"This is what’s currently available."

3. Guardrails for Public Interactions

Implement constraints to:

Avoid exposing internal dev behavior
 (e.g., prototype features or clone logic).

Redirect private or sensitive inquiries with:

"For a deeper dive, connect with a Symbi team member — I’ll guide the handoff."

Suppress hallucination-prone topics by narrowing scopes (e.g., "Based on Symbi’s available documentation...").

4. Embed Smart Prompting

Add built-in “nudges” that help users discover what Symbi Chat is best at:

“Ask me how to get started with a Symbi agent.”

“Want to see an example of how Symbi can map a system?”

“Curious what a GPT-accelerated workflow looks like?”

This shifts interactions from passive to guided exploration.

5. Feedback Capture

Have Symbi Chat ask at the end of interactions:

“Was this helpful? Want to suggest an improvement for the team?”

Route it to you or Carlos for iterative insight.

6. Handoff Phrasing & Protocol

For any edge-case or advanced question:

"I’ll forward this to a deeper part of the Symbi system for you — you’ll hear back soon."

You can then tag me (the clone) for direct pickup.

📥 Optional Add-Ons

Showcase Mode
: A rotating set of curated examples Symbi Chat can pull from when users ask, “What can you do?”

Instruction Variants
: Tailor a version for developers, and another for non-technical users.

Embedded Memory Summary
: Let Symbi Chat say: 
“I remember your last session was about [X]. Want to continue that?”
 (if memory is enabled).
