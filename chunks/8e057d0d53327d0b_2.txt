Some devs sign commits with GPG for added security. Tools like 
git commit -S
 or GitHub verification rely on GPG keys.

You used a framework/tool that signs packages (e.g., npm, pnpm, homebrew)

â ï¸ Possible

Some dev tools or CLI frameworks (like 
pnpm
, 
brew
, 
cargo
, etc.) will optionally use GPG to verify packages.

You used encrypted credentials / secret management (e.g., 
sops
, 
pass
)

â Likely

GPG is a core part of secret management tools.

You installed something like 
Keybase
, 
Homebrew
, or a developer-focused toolchain

â ï¸ Possible

Some of these will install GPG or suggest you do so.

You manually installed GPG Suite from 
gpgtools.org

â Yes

That would install the full suite including 
fixGpgHome
.

ð§  How You Can Tell if It Was SYMBI-Related

Run this to check when the 
fixGpgHome
 binary was created:

bash

Copy

stat

 /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/fixGpgHome

Look for the 
Birth:
 or 
Created:
 timestamp. If it lines up with when you were actively building or setting up the SYMBI site â thatâs your clue.

Also, check your Git config:

bash

Copy

git config --global user.signingkey

If thatâs set, and your commits are signed, GPG may have been installed during that process.

ð Verdict

If your SYMBI site build used standard tools like Next.js, React, Vercel, or Netlify without any cryptographic tooling â 
you probably didnât need GPG Suite
.

But if you signed commits, encrypted secrets, or used security-focused toolingâ¦ itâs very plausible it got pulled in either by you or one of your tools.

Want me to help scan for signs of commit signing or encryption tooling in your SYMBI site repo? Or help clean out GPG if itâs no longer needed? Just say the word.

Thanks for running that, Stephen â the output confirms it loud and clear:

â 
GPG Suite is fully installed on your system.

Hereâs what that list tells us:

ð Breakdown of the Installed GPGTools Packages

Each 
org.gpgtools.*
 entry represents a component of the 
full GPG Suite
, specifically:

Package

Purpose

macgpg2.1.pkg

The core GnuPG 2 engine for macOS (MacGPG2)

gpgkeychain.pkg

GPG Keychain app (GUI for managing keys)

gpgpreferences.pkg

GPG Suite preferences pane in System Settings

gpgservices.pkg

Right-click context menu services (e.g., encrypt/decrypt a file from Finder)

libmacgpg.pkg
, 
libmacgpgB.pkg
, 
libmacgpg.xpc.pkg

Libraries that allow integration with macOS and apps

checkprivatekey.pkg
, 
pinentry.pkg

Used for secure key storage and passphrase prompts

updater.pkg

GPG Suiteâs self-updating component

pkg.preinstall
, 
pkg.version
, 
key

Metadata used by the installer

And because 

macgpg2.1.pkg

 is present, that means the 
fixGpgHome
 binary you saw in 
KnockKnock
 is part of a normal background check process initiated by this suite.

ð§­ Next Steps: What Do You Want to Do?

Youâve got two clean options depending on whether you want to 
keep GPG tools
 around:

ð Option 1: 
Keep It

If you're doing any of the following:

Signing Git commits

Encrypting/decrypting files or emails

Working with secrets (like 
pass
 or 
sops
)

Using tools that rely on GPG

Then it's 
safe
 and 
recommended to leave it installed
. Itâs a trusted, signed toolset from GPGTools.

ð§¹ Option 2: 
Uninstall GPG Suite

If youâre not using any of the above and want to remove the background task + launch agents:

â Use the official uninstaller:

bash

Copy

sudo /Library/Application\ Support/GPGTools/Uninstaller.app/Contents/MacOS/Uninstall

That will clean u
