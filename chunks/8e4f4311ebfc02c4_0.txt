do you have an app for mac

ChatGPT said:

No, I don't have a dedicated Mac app, but you can use ChatGPT through a web browser at 
chat.openai.com
 on your Mac.

If you're looking for a more app-like experience, you can:

Use the web version
 and create a shortcut on your Mac's dock.

Install ChatGPT as a web app
 via Chrome or Edge by clicking on the three-dot menu > "More tools" > "Create shortcut" and enabling "Open as window."

Use the iOS ChatGPT app
 if you have an iPhone or iPad, which might sync well with your Mac via Handoff.

Would you like guidance on setting any of these up?
