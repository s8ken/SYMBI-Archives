 
Apple Menu
 → 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Profiles

🚨 
If you see a profile you don’t recognize, REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY.

If "Profiles" is missing, that's good
—it means no MDM is installed.

Go to
  
Apple Menu
 → 
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
About

Scroll to 
“Management”
 (only visible if MDM is installed).

If it appears, remove it by clicking “Remove Management”
 (you may need admin rights).

🛑 
Check & Disable Remote Login (SSH)

Go to
  
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
Sharing

Make sure ALL remote access services are OFF
:

❌ 
Remote Login
 (SSH)

❌ 
Remote Management
 (Apple Remote Desktop)

❌ 
Screen Sharing

❌ 
AirPlay Receiver

❌ 
Bluetooth Sharing

❌ 
Content Caching

❌ 
Internet Sharing

⛔ 
Check for Hidden Remote Access Apps

Run this Terminal command to see if anything suspicious is running:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep LISTEN

Look for unusual services that are listening for connections.

2️⃣ Stop Unauthorized Camera & Microphone Access

Attackers could use apps or accessibility exploits to hijack your camera/mic.

📸 
Disable Camera & Mic Access for Unauthorized Apps

Go to
  
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security

Select “Camera” & “Microphone”

🚫 
Turn OFF access for all apps except the ones you trust (e.g., FaceTime, Zoom)

If an app is listed that you didn’t install, investigate it immediately.

🛑 
Check for Fake or Hidden Camera Apps

Run this command in Terminal to list apps that have requested camera/mic access:

bash

Copy

tccutil reset Camera
tccutil reset Microphone

This will reset permissions, forcing apps to request access again—
if something re-enables itself without asking, it’s suspicious.

3️⃣ Stop Unauthorized AirPlay / Screen Mirroring

Since you suspected AirPlay was used in the past, let’s 
fully lock it down
.

🖥️ 
Turn Off AirPlay & Screen Mirroring

Go to
  
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
AirDrop & Handoff

Set "AirDrop" to “Receiving Off”

Turn OFF "Allow Handoff"

Go to "AirPlay & Receiver"

Set 
"Allow AirPlay"
 to 
OFF

If you must keep it on, set it to 
“Only People Sharing This Mac”

🔎 
Check for Unauthorized AirPlay Devices

Go to
  
System Settings
 → 
Control Center

Look under “Screen Mirroring”
 → If you see any devices 
you don’t recognize
, remove them.

4️⃣ Extra Steps to Ensure No Hidden Monitoring

✔ 
Check Accessibility Settings
 (Attackers may use these for remote control)

Go to
  
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Accessibility

Remove ALL apps unless you installed them yourself.

✔ 
Run a Quick Malware Scan
 (Check for persistence)

bash

Copy

sudo system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType | grep -i 

"remote"

This lists apps that contain "remote" in their name or description.

✔ 
Check Login Items & Background Services

Go to
  
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
Login Items

Disable any unknown items.

Run this command in Terminal:

bash

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i remote

If anything suspicious appears, let me know.

Final Step: Reboot & Monitor for Suspicious Behavior

Restart your Mac and check if 
any settings re-enable themselves

If anything 
turns back on automatically
, it could indicate a deeper issue.
