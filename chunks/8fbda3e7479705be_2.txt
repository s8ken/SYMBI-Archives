Here's what I see in your

Processes Listening on Your Mac

Process

Port

Purpose

Safe?

rapportd

49153

Apple’s device proximity service (used for Handoff, Continuity, etc.)

✅ Safe, but can be disabled if unwanted

Disk\x20D

49189

Unknown – possibly related to disk monitoring software

⚠️ Suspicious, needs investigation

adb

5037

Android Debug Bridge (used for connecting Android devices)

⚠️ Shouldn't be running if you don’t use Android debugging

cupsd

ipp

Print service (CUPS for local printing)

✅ Safe if you use a printer

What You Should Do Next

🚨 
1️⃣ Investigate & Kill Suspicious Processes

Check the "Disk D" Process

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep 

"Disk\x20D"

If you don’t recognize it, kill it:

bash

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 1108

Check 
adb
 (Android Debug Bridge)

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep adb

If you 
did not install Android development tools
, remove it:

bash

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 1129

Then, prevent it from starting again:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.android.adb.plist

🛑 
2️⃣ Disable 
rapportd
 (If You Don’t Use Handoff & Continuity)

Since 
rapportd
 handles Apple’s proximity features (like AirDrop & Handoff), you can disable it if you don’t need those:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

Then restart your Mac.

🔎 
3️⃣ Check for Hidden Remote Services

Run this command to check for unknown remote access tools:

bash

Copy

sudo netstat -anp tcp | grep LISTEN

Look for anything unusual listening on non-standard ports.

Final Questions for You

Do you recognize 
Disk\x20D
?

If not, we may need to check its source.

Do you use Android development tools?

If not, 
adb
 shouldn’t be running.

Are you experiencing 
any strange behavior after rebooting
?

If anything reappears after killing it, it could be a sign of persistence.

Let me know what you find! 🚀

You Successfully Killed 
adb
, but It Might Restart

The process was running (
adb -L tcp:5037 fork-server server --reply-fd 4
), meaning 
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) was active
.

You 
successfully killed it
, but we need to 
make sure it doesn’t come back
.

1️⃣ Unload 
adb
 Properly

Since 
launchctl unload
 gave an 
Input/output error
, try the alternative command:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.android.adb.plist

If it says 
"No such process"
, that means 
adb
 isn’t set to restart.

2️⃣ Check If 
adb
 Reappears After a Reboot

To be 
100% sure it's gone
, restart your Mac and run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep adb

If 
it comes back
, it may be hiding in another location. In that case, try:

bash

Copy

sudo find / -name 

"adb"

 2>/dev/null

🚨 
If 
adb
 is found somewhere unexpected, we need to manually delete it.

Quick Question: Did You Install Any Android-Related Software?

If 
you didn’t install
 anything related to Android (like Bluestacks, Android Studio, etc.), 
adb
 being active 
is suspicious
 and we should dig deeper.

If 
you did install
 something, but you don't need 
adb
, we can 
fully remove it
.
