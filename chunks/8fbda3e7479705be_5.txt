🚨 
Immediate Concern: Suspicious NFS Mount (
.DDPreviewDisk
)
 🚨

This line stands out:

bash

Copy

.DDPreviewDisk on /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk (nfs, nodev, nosuid, synchronous, mounted by lcl)

.DDPreviewDisk
 is mounted via NFS (Network File System)
 – This suggests 
a remote storage volume is attached
.

It’s in 

/Users/lcl/.DDPreview/

, which is 
a hidden directory
—this is highly unusual.

You didn’t manually mount this, correct?
 If not, it 
could be an unauthorized remote volume.

🚨 Immediate Next Steps

1️⃣ Unmount 
.DDPreviewDisk
 (If You Didn't Intentionally Mount It)

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

This will 
forcefully unmount
 the suspicious volume.

2️⃣ Check If It Reappears After Reboot

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo reboot

After rebooting, run 
mount
 again to 
see if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 comes back.

If it 
remounts itself,
 something is 
reinstalling it automatically.

3️⃣ Find Out What Mounted It

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep DDPreview

This will show 
what process created 
.DDPreviewDisk
.

If you see a 
suspicious app or process
, let me know.

4️⃣ List All Network Volumes

Run:

bash

Copy

showmount -e localhost

This lists 
NFS shares on your Mac.

Let me know 
if any unexpected shares appear.

5️⃣ Check Launch Agents & Daemons (Persistence Mechanisms)

To see if something 
automatically mounts 
.DDPreviewDisk
 on startup
, check:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

🚨 Look for 
files related to DDPreview, NFS, or anything suspicious.

🛑 Questions for You:

Did you manually set up an NFS share called 
.DDPreviewDisk
?

Did you recently install any software related to remote file access or previews?

Have you noticed files being accessed remotely or strange network activity?

🚨 If you 
didn’t
 set this up, this could be an 
active persistence mechanism
 keeping an external connection open. Let me know what you find! 🚀

ok so I installed a program called drill disk 

ChatGPT said:

Ah, that makes sense! 
Disk Drill
 is a data recovery tool, and it likely created 
.DDPreviewDisk
 as a virtual preview disk for file recovery.

Since 
Disk Drill has access to deep system files and disk volumes
, it’s important to verify that:

It isn’t running anything unnecessary in the background.

It isn’t creating unintended remote access points.

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ Check If Disk Drill Is Running in the Background

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep drill

If you see processes related to 
Disk Drill
, note their 
process IDs (PIDs)
 and stop them:

bash

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

2️⃣ Fully Uninstall Disk Drill (If You Don’t Need It)

If you installed Disk Drill just for testing and don’t plan to use it, remove it completely:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Disk\ Drill.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/CleverFiles
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.cleverfiles.DiskDrill.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Extensions/DiskDrill.kext

Then, 
check if 
.DDPreviewDisk
 disappears
 using 
mount
.

3️⃣ Ensure Disk Drill Isn't Auto-Mounting Disks on Startup

Check for any 
launch agents or daemons
 related to Disk Drill:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep -i drill

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i drill

If any files are found, 
remove them
:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /path/to/suspicious/file.plist

4️⃣ Confirm If 
.DDPreviewDisk
 Still Exists After Reboot

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo reboot

After rebooting, check 
mount
 again. If the 
network volume is still there, something else is causing it
.

Should You Keep Disk Drill?

If you 
needed it for data recovery,
