Let me know how it goes after following these steps! If 
.DDPreviewDisk
 reappears or you encounter any issues, we’ll dig deeper into it.

okay I haven't completed the data recover with drip disk yet so lets park that while we investigate the networks drive and any uneccary permissions apart from drill disk that might be lurking already

Got it! Let's focus on 
network drives
 and 
permissions
 while leaving Disk Drill aside for now.

Steps to Investigate Network Drive and Permissions:

1️⃣ Check for Mounted Network Drives

Since you're seeing a network drive mounted at 
.DDPreviewDisk
 (which may be linked to an NFS mount), let's confirm if there are any other active network volumes.

Run the following:

bash

Copy

mount

Look for any entries related to 
NFS
, 
SMB
, or other network protocols. Specifically, check if there’s anything like this:

bash

Copy

.DDPreviewDisk on /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk (nfs, nodev, nosuid, synchronous, mounted by lcl)

If you see anything unusual, we can proceed to remove or isolate it.

2️⃣ Check Active Network Shares

To ensure no unauthorized network shares are active, run:

bash

Copy

sudo nfsstat -c

This will show if your system is exporting any NFS shares (and to whom). If there are any unexpected entries, you’ll want to disable them.

Similarly, check for any 
SMB (Windows file sharing)
 shares by running:

bash

Copy

sudo smbutil statshares -a

This will list all currently shared network drives. If any of these are unfamiliar, we can investigate further.

3️⃣ Check for Unnecessary Permissions

Let's review the permissions on key folders, especially if they’re tied to network drives or apps you no longer need.

First, check permissions on the 
.DDPreviewDisk
:

bash

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

This will show the permissions of the 
.DDPreviewDisk
. If you see 
read/write permissions
 granted to any unfamiliar users or apps, we should adjust them accordingly.

Next, check the general file permissions for your home directory:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~

This will show all files in your home directory and their permissions. Look for anything 
unusual or unauthorized
 that might have been set up without your consent.

4️⃣ Disable Unnecessary Permissions

To stop apps or network services from accessing files they shouldn’t, you can go through 
System Preferences
 > 
Security & Privacy
 > 
Privacy
 and manually 
remove unnecessary permissions
 for:

Full Disk Access

Files and Folders

Automation
 (look for any apps that shouldn’t have access)

5️⃣ Check System Preferences for Remote Management

We also want to confirm that 
remote management
 isn’t enabled by accident. Check this:

Go to 
System Preferences
 > 
Sharing
.

Ensure that 
Screen Sharing
 and 
Remote Management
 are both 
disabled
 unless you specifically need them.

Let me know what you find in these steps, and we’ll dig into any further network issues or unnecessary permissions!
