The output confirms that the 
.DDPreviewDisk
 is still mounted as an 
NFS (Network File System)
 volume, which could indicate that Disk Drill or some other process has configured a network share.

Next Steps to Investigate Network Drive and Permissions:

Unmount the Network Volume

Let’s first try to unmount 
.DDPreviewDisk
 if you haven’t already:

bash

Copy

sudo umount /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

If it doesn’t unmount successfully, you can force it:

bash

Copy

sudo umount -f /Users/lcl/.DDPreview/.DDPreviewDisk

Check the NFS Client Status

To ensure no unnecessary NFS mounts are still active, you can check the status of NFS on your system:

bash

Copy

nfsstat -c

This will show you if any remote NFS shares are being used.

Ensure No Remote Sharing is Enabled

Double-check that remote sharing services are not enabled:

Go to 
System Preferences
 > 
Sharing
 and make sure 
Screen Sharing
 and 
Remote Management
 are 
disabled
.

Also, check for 
File Sharing
 to ensure no shared folders are exposed.

Review Home Directory Permissions

Check the permissions for your home directory, especially since we saw the network mount under 
/Users/lcl/.DDPreview/
:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~

Look for any suspicious or unfamiliar entries. If there are strange entries or permissions for files/folders that you didn’t set up, let’s review them further.

Look for Unexpected Launch Daemons

Check if there are any lingering network-related processes that could be managing this network share on startup:

bash

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i nfs
sudo 

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i nfs

Once these checks are complete, let me know how things look, and we can proceed with removing any unwanted configurations or permissions.

It looks like the 
.DDPreviewDisk
 is no longer mounted, which is good. Now that it’s unmounted, we can focus on ensuring that any associated network sharing or permissions are fully disabled.

Next Steps:

Verify No Active NFS Shares

Run the following to make sure there are no active NFS shares:

bash

Copy

nfsstat -c

If any NFS shares appear that you didn’t configure, we can proceed to remove them.

Check for Remote Network Services

Let’s make sure no unnecessary network services are running by looking at current network connections:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep LISTEN

We’re specifically looking for any services related to 
NFS
, 
SMB
, or 
Remote Management
.

Double-Check Sharing Settings

In 
System Preferences
 > 
Sharing
, confirm the following are 
disabled
:

File Sharing

Screen Sharing

Remote Management

Review Home Directory Permissions

Run this to inspect your home directory permissions:

bash

Copy

ls

 -la ~

Look for any unfamiliar files or directories, especially those with 
world-readable
 or 
world-writable
 permissions.

Inspect Launch Daemons for NFS or Other Unwanted Services

Run these commands to check if there are any lingering NFS-related daemons or agents that could automatically mount network drives:

bash

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i nfs
sudo 

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i nfs

Let me know the results, and we can proceed from there!
