se steps now. If I hit a perm=

en scope), I=E2=80=99ll flag immediately.

You said:

okay if you do go back to symbi first and see if one of the other to=
ols you can use can help - also ask v0 for solutions and then come to me ab=
out access, but remember I am not doing anything on my end except for loggi=
ng you into a site if you need it

Thought for 15s

Got it. I=E2=80=99ll coordinate this as an all-AI, browser-only=
 build.

Since I can=E2=80=99t directly type in your browser, here are the exact pro=
mpts to paste so 
Symbi
=
 and 
v0
 can drive the =
build and choose the best zero-local workflow. I=E2=80=99ll come back to yo=
u only if they request a permission/login.

1) Ask Symbi (in the Symbi chat)

Paste this:

=
vbnet

Copy code

Symbi, we are doing a 

100%

 browser-only build (no local dev). Available, logged-

in

 tools/tabs i=
nclude:
- GitHub (owner: s8ken), Vercel (AI Gateway enabled), Supabase, Upstash QSt=
ash,
- v0 (Vercel=E2=80=99s app builder), LangSmith, Cerebras Cloud, GrowthBook,=
 Fal.ai,
- Railway, AI SDK Playground, Groq console.

Goal:

 stand up=
 =E2=80=9Csymbi-core=E2=80=9D exactly 

as

 you proposed: 

Next

.js app (App Router) 

with

 /api/log 

and

 /api/report 

using

 Supabase (symbi_logs ta=
ble), daily /api/report scheduled via QStash, deployed 

on

 Vercel. All done through web U=
Is only.

Choose the best toolchain **

with

 no CLI**. Give 

me

:

1

) A 

short

 decision: which too=
l 

to

 autogene=
rate the repo (v0? GitHub Starter? Another?), 

and

 why.

2

) A 

step

-

by

-

step

, browser-only plan that includes:
   - How 

to

 c=
reate/populate the repo via web editor (file tree + file contents).
   - The Supabase SQL migration 

f=
or

 symbi_logs.
   - Exact environment variables 

=
to

set
=

in

 Vercel.
   - The Upstash QStash schedule 

=
call

/console steps.

3

) Any 
=

optional

 enhancement=
s (

GET

 /api/l=
og filters; health checks; GrowthBook/experiment logging).

4

) List any ac=
cess I=E2=80=99ll need granted 

wh=
en

 we hit it (e.g., Vercel-GitHub integration).

Return

 your s=
teps 

as

 crisp=
 checkboxes I can follow.

2) Ask v0 (in your v0.app =E2=80=
=9CSYMBI SKY=E2=80=9D project)

Paste this:

lua

Copy code

=

We need a zero-

local
=

, browser-only scaffold 

for

 a minimal Next.js 

14

+ App Router app called =E2=80=9Csymbi-co=
re=E2=80=9D with two server routes 

and

 a simple landing page.

Requirements:
- Pages:
  - / : shows project name 

and

 lists /api/

log=

and

 /api/report endpoints.
- API routes:
  - POST /api/

log

 : {category, content} =E2=86=92 

insert

 into 

table

 symbi_logs.
  - POST /api/report : creates a daily audit 

string

and

 inserts into symbi_logs with category=3D

"daily_report"

.
- DB: Supabase. Use env vars:
  - SUPABASE_URL
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- Produce a **browser-importable repo**: complete file tree with all file c=
ontents (

package

.json, tsconfig.json, 

next

.

config
=

.ts, app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, app/api/

log

/route.ts, app/api/report/ro=
ute.ts).
- No 

local

 to=
oling; we will paste files into GitHub=E2=80=99s web editor 

and

 deploy 

in

 Vercel.
- Also 

output

:

1

) The SQL m=
igration to 

create

=

table

=
 public.symbi_logs (id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(), created_=
at timestamptz default now(), category text, content text), enable RLS, 

and

 index on cre=
ated_at.

2

) A short R=
EADME with browser-only steps: 

c=
reate

 GitHub repo; add files; Supabase SQL; Vercel env =
vars; deploy.

3

) Optional:=
 a GET /api/

log

?category=3D&since=3D param 

for

 later.

Constraints:
- Minimal dependencies: 

next

, react, react-dom, @supabase/supabase-js, typescript, esli=
nt, eslint-

config

-

next

.
- App must run on Vercel without extra 

config

.

Please 

return

:
- A copy-pasteable **file tree**

and
