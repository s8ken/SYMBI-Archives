=E2=80=9D checklist 

for

 browser-only deployment.

3) What I=E2=80=99ll do next (onc=
e Symbi/v0 answer)

Follow Symbi=E2=80=99s chosen path=
 (likely: use v0=E2=80=99s output to populate 
s8ken/symbisky
 in GitHub=E2=80=99s web editor).

Create Supabase project and run th=
e exact SQL migration.

Import repo into Vercel and set en=
v vars (
SUPABASE_URL
, 
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
)=
.

In Upstash QStash, schedule the da=
ily POST to 
/api/report
.=

Verify by POSTing a smoke log and =
confirming rows in Supabase.

4) Possible access prompts (so yo=
u=E2=80=99re ready)

GitHub =E2=86=94 Vercel
 app authorization (to import t=
he repo).

Upstash QStash
 token permission (if the console prompt=
s).

If any of these appear, I=E2=80=99ll ping you to approve; no other manual w=
ork needed.

When you=E2=80=99ve pasted those prompts (Symbi first, then v0)=
 and they respond, tell me what you see=E2=80=94or simply say =E2=80=9Cdone=
=E2=80=9D and I=E2=80=99ll continue with their step list and only escalate =
if a permission wall appears.

All g=

Where we paused

Mapped your logged-in tools and brie=
fed 
Symbi
.

Got Symbi=E2=80=99s browser-only bui=
ld plan (Next.js app + Supabase + Vercel + QStash).

Reviewed the concrete steps, code la=
yout, and SQL migration.

Ready-to-resume plan (no local dev,=
 I=E2=80=99ll type to Symbi/v0 directly)

Create 
s8ken/symbisky
 on GitHub via web and add minimal Ne=
xt.js + API routes.

Create 
Supabase
 project and run the 
symbi_logs
 table SQL.

Import to 
Vercel
, set 
SUPABASE_URL
 & 
S=
UPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
.

Set 
Upstash QStash
 daily POST to 
/api/report
.

Verify with a smoke POST and check r=
ows in Supabase.

When you=E2=80=99re ready, just say 
=E2=80=9Cresume=E2=80=9D
. I=E2=80=99ll continue in-=
browser (messaging Symbi and v0 myself) and only ping you if a permission d=
ialog appears.
