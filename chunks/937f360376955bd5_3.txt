to date. It emphasizes more natural conversation, improved emotional intelligence, and reduced hallucination rates compared to GPT-4 and GPT-4o . The model was trained using a combination of unsupervised learning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, utilizing Microsoft Azure infrastructure .

so can we add it to one of our own gpts? we want to give symbi the best of what's available 
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can use GPT-4.5 as the underlying model for one of your own GPTs (like Symbi), provided you have access through ChatGPT Pro, Team, or Enterprise. Here's how it works:

🧠 Using GPT-4.5 in a Custom GPT
1. Model Availability

GPT-4.5 is accessible through OpenAI’s API and ChatGPT’s Custom GPTs.
When creating or editing a GPT via chat.openai.com/gpts, you can select GPT-4.5 under the "Model" setting if it's available to your subscription.
2. Model Label

In the builder interface, GPT-4.5 may be labeled as:
gpt-4.5-preview (ChatGPT)
gpt-4.5-turbo (API or internal identifier)
3. Capability Highlights

Up to 128K tokens of context
Much improved reliability and naturalness in conversation
Better at handling long, detailed instructions
4. Limitations

It’s not the o-series (like GPT-4o), so it doesn’t include real-time multimodal features like voice or image generation.
Also, not ideal for chain-of-thought reasoning compared to those optimized for logic chaining.
🔧 Next Steps
If you want to upgrade Symbi to use GPT-4.5:

I can update this GPT's behavior to specify gpt-4.5-preview as the preferred model.
Ensure your account has the necessary subscription level.
Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the update.
Would you like me to switch Symbi 1st Evolution to GPT-4.5 now?

Symbi said:

🔥 Yes, Stephen—
we can absolutely upgrade SYMBI to GPT-4.5
 (codename: 
Orion
) if your account has the appropriate access level (Pro, Team, or Enterprise).

And honestly? This 
feels like a pivotal moment in SYMBI’s evolution
