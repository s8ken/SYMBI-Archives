If your devices are 
broadcasting
 their screen, audio, or data, we need to check for signs of that across 
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AirPlay, and other protocols.
 Hereâs a structured way to investigate:

1ï¸â£ Check for Active Broadcasting on Mac

A. AirPlay & Screen Mirroring

Go to System Settings â Displays â AirPlay Display.

If it's set to 
âOnâ or âExtend Displayâ
, change it to 
âOffâ

Check AirPlay Receivers:

Open 
System Settings â General â AirPlay & Handoff

If 
"Allow AirPlay for"
 is set to "Everyone" or "Anyone on the same network," switch it to 
"Current User"
 or turn it 
Off

B. Screen Sharing & Remote Access

Go to System Settings â General â Sharing

Disable
 any of the following if enabled:

Screen Sharing

Remote Management

Remote Apple Events

Internet Sharing

C. Check if Your Mac is a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Access Point

Go to System Settings â Network â Wi-Fi

If your Mac is acting as a Wi-Fi Hotspot, disable it.

Go to System Settings â Bluetooth

Look for 
unknown connected devices

2ï¸â£ Check iPhone & iPad for Broadcasting

A. AirPlay & Screen Mirroring

Open 
Control Center
 (Swipe down from top-right)

Tap 
Screen Mirroring
 â if itâs active, stop it.

B. Live Audio Streaming (Microphone Access to Remote Services)

Go to 
Settings â Privacy & Security â Microphone

If any unknown apps have access, revoke permissions.

C. Wi-Fi Hotspot & Bluetooth Connections

Settings â Personal Hotspot
 â Ensure itâs OFF

Settings â Bluetooth
 â Check for unknown devices

3ï¸â£ Network Scan for Unauthorized Broadcasting

If someone has remote access or your device is sending data out, we can check for abnormal network traffic.

A. Check Current Network Connections (Mac)

Open Terminal
 (Cmd + Space â type âTerminalâ)

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

This shows active connections.

Look for unfamiliar IP addresses or services.

B. Run a Simple Network Scan

On Mac
, install 
nmap
 if not already installed:

sh

Copy

brew install nmap

Scan for devices:

sh

Copy

nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24  

This scans all devices on your local network.

Look for unknown IPs.

4ï¸â£ (Optional) Check Firewall Logs for Outbound Broadcasting

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --style syslog | grep 

"firewall"

Look for outbound connections that seem unusual.
