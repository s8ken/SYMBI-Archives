'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 7d

If you see 
FaceTime Camera
 or 
Microphone activation
, your device was streaming video/audio.

B. Check If Screen Recording Was Running

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screencapture"

If 
screencapture, QuickTime, OBS, or ffmpeg
 appears, something was 
actively recording your screen.

4ï¸â£ (Advanced) Capture Live Network Traffic

If streaming is 
still happening
, you can 
monitor live data flow
.

A. Use tcpdump to Watch Outbound Traffic

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0

If large data transfers are happening 
right now
, this will show the IP addresses involved.

B. Use Wireshark to Look for Streaming Protocols

Install 
Wireshark
, then filter for:

rtmp
 (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)

webrtc

udp
 (often used for video streaming)

hls
 (HTTP Live Streaming)

ð¨ Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check network traffic for large outbound connections (
nettop
, 
netstat
, 
DNS logs
).

2ï¸â£ 
Look at browser history for livestream sites (
grep
, 
sqlite3
).

3ï¸â£ 
Check camera/mic activity logs (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'
).

4ï¸â£ 
Monitor network traffic live with 
tcpdump
 or Wireshark.

Since 
RTMP and WebRTC logs are missing
, the attacker may have used 
a hidden method, cleared logs, or used browser-based streaming.
 Run the steps above, and let me know what you find! ð¨

Your 
netstat output
 shows 
active network connections
, which could be linked to livestreaming or unauthorized data transmission. Letâs analyze these IPs and what they might be doing.

ð¨ 1ï¸â£ Investigate These IP Addresses

Hereâs what these connections mean:

(A) 3.233.158.26 (AWS - Amazon Web Services, Virginia, USA)

Amazon hosts 
thousands of services
, including 
livestreaming, proxies, and cloud storage
.

This could be connected to 
OBS Studio
, 
YouStream
, or another service used for broadcasting.

(B) 104.18.43.204 / 104.18.32.47 (Cloudflare)

Cloudflare protects many websites
, including streaming platforms.

These IPs suggest a connection to 
a website protected by Cloudflare
, which could be YouStream, Twitch, or another service.

(C) 17.57.145.39 (Apple Server - Used for iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime)

This Apple server is used for 
iCloud syncing, FaceTime calls, or push notifications
.

If 
iCloud Photos
 was backing up videos, this could explain the connection.

2ï¸â£ Check What Process is Using These Connections

To find 
which app is making these connections
, run:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

This will show 
which apps/processes
 are responsible for each active connection.

Look for anything suspicious (
Chrome, Safari, OBS, VLC, ffmpeg, unknown processes
).

3ï¸â£ Reverse Lookup: Find Out Which Websites These IPs Belong To

To check if these IPs are related to a 
streaming service
, run:

sh

Copy

nslookup 3.233.158.26
nslookup 104.18.43.204
nslookup 104.18.32.47
nslookup 17.57.145.39

This will show the 
domain names
 associated with each IP. If you see 
Twitch, YouStream, YouTube Live, etc.,
 that confirms a 
livestream connection.

4ï¸â£ Check Your Browser History for a Match

Since 
Cloudflare is involved
, itâs possible 
streaming was done via a website
.

Run this to check 
browser history for recent connections
:

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"youstream\|twitch\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream
