%';"

If 
YouStream, Twitch, or another streaming platform appears
, that confirms 
livestreaming via browser
.

ð¨ Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find which app is making these connections (
lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED
).

2ï¸â£ 
Reverse lookup the IPs (
nslookup
) to see which services they belong to.

3ï¸â£ 
Check browser history for livestream-related websites.

Since 
Amazon AWS and Cloudflare are involved
, this strongly suggests a 
web-based or hidden livestream
. Let me know what you find! ð¨

I did use twitch for a few days 

ChatGPT said:

That explains some of the Cloudflare and AWS connectionsâTwitch uses both for streaming and data distribution. However, we still need to confirm:

1ï¸â£ 
Was Twitch the only livestreaming platform used?

2ï¸â£ 
Did any unauthorized streams occur?

ð¨ Next Steps to Confirm if There Were Unauthorized Livestreams

1ï¸â£ Check Twitch-Specific Connections

Run:

sh

Copy

nslookup 104.18.43.204
nslookup 104.18.32.47

If these resolve to 
Twitch
, it confirms the connections were Twitch-related.

2ï¸â£ Check Your Twitch Account for Past Streams

Since Twitch 
keeps a record of past broadcasts
, check:

Go to

https://www.twitch.tv/
 â Click your profile.

Go to Creator Dashboard â Content â Video Producer.

If you see 
streams you didnât initiate
, thatâs a red flag.

3ï¸â£ Check for Hidden Twitch Stream Keys

If your stream key was stolen, an attacker could broadcast on your behalf.

Go to Twitch
 â Settings â Stream

Reset your stream key
 to ensure no one else can use it.

ð 4ï¸â£ Was There Streaming Outside of Twitch?

Since you used Twitch, we now need to check if 
other livestreaming happened without your knowledge.

A. Scan Browser History for Other Streaming Sites

Run:

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

If you see 
YouStream, Facebook Live, or another platform
, that suggests 
other livestreams happened.

B. Check If OBS Was Streaming Elsewhere

Even though you deleted OBS, if it streamed to 
multiple platforms (Twitch + another service),
 the logs might remain.

Run:

sh

Copy

cat

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/obs-*.txt | grep -i 

"rtmp\|stream"

If OBS logged multiple 
streaming destinations
, thatâs a sign of dual-streaming (multi-platform broadcasting).

ð¨ Summary of Next Actions

â 
Confirm if the IPs belong to Twitch (
nslookup
).

â 
Check your Twitch account for past unauthorized broadcasts.

â 
Reset your Twitch stream key (if compromised).

â 
Look for evidence of livestreaming outside of Twitch (
grep
 browser history, OBS logs).

Since you used Twitch, itâs possible the logs 
only reflect your own activity
âbut we need to be sure 
nothing else was broadcasted without your consent.

Let me know what you find! ð¨

ChatGPT said:

The 
NXDOMAIN
 response means the reverse lookup 
did not return a domain name
, which happens for some 
Cloudflare-protected services
. These IPs 
could still belong to Twitch
, but we need a different approach to confirm.

ð¨ Next Steps to Identify These Connections

Since the reverse lookup didnât work, let's try a 
forward lookup
 (checking what domains your Mac connected to).

1ï¸â£ Find Out Which Domains Your Mac Contacted

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 7d

This will list 
all DNS requests your Mac made in the last 7 days
, which may reveal:

Twitch streaming servers

Other unknown streaming platforms
