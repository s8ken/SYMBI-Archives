tream, etc.),
 check browser history.

A. Search Browser History for Streaming Platforms

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

If 
YouStream, Twitch, YouTube Live, or Facebook Live appear
, that means livestreaming was initiated from your browser.

B. Check for WebRTC Connections in Browser Logs

Since WebRTC doesnât always leave logs, check:

Chrome:
 Open 
chrome://webrtc-internals/
 â Look for recent WebRTC sessions.

Safari:
 Go to 
Develop â WebRTC
 â Check for past streaming connections.

ð¥ 5ï¸â£ Check for Past Video or Audio Captures

If livestreaming happened, there might still be 
locally saved screen recordings.

A. Search for Video Files in Hidden Locations

Run:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

If videos were saved 
before being uploaded
, they might still exist.

Check 
/private/tmp/
 or 
~/Library/Application Support/
 for hidden files.

B. Scan for Camera & Microphone Usage

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 21d

If your 
camera or microphone were used
, that suggests a 
livestream with video/audio.

ð¨ Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Scan logs for past livestreaming (
log show --predicate "rtmp|webrtc|hls"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check network activity (
nettop
, 
netstat
) for past outbound livestreams.

3ï¸â£ 
Find hidden livestreaming apps (
ps aux | grep stream
).

4ï¸â£ 
Check browser history for streaming sites.

5ï¸â£ 
Look for video/audio captures (
log show --predicate "AVCapture"
).

Since logs might have been 
cleared
, we need to 
check multiple sources
. Let me know what you find, and weâll trace it further! ð¨

Since the 
log search for RTMP, WebRTC, and HLS
 returned 
nothing
, this means:

1ï¸â£ 
Logs were cleared
 (either manually or by an attacker).

2ï¸â£ 
Livestreaming happened through a method that didnât leave traditional logs.

3ï¸â£ 
A hidden process, VPN, or proxy was used to obfuscate activity.

ð¨ Next Steps: Letâs Go Deeper

Since logs 
didnât reveal streaming
, weâll check 
network traffic, system processes, and browser data.

1ï¸â£ Identify Which App Was Streaming

If a livestream occurred, the process might 
still be running
 or have left traces.

A. List Any Running Streaming Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"stream\|obs\|ffmpeg\|screencapture"

ð Look for:

OBS
 (if it wasnât fully removed)

ffmpeg
 (command-line video streamer)

screencapture
 (macOS built-in)

B. Check for Background Streaming Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg\|obs"

If any 
streaming-related services
 are running, they might have been used for livestreaming.

2ï¸â£ Find Where Data Was Sent (Network Forensics)

Even if logs were cleared, network connections might 
still reveal livestreaming.

A. Check Current Network Activity

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to unknown IPs.

B. Find Which Apps Are Sending Data

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

This will 
show which apps
 are responsible for active connections.

Look for:

Chrome/Safari (if streaming happened in browser)

Any unknown processes continuously sending data

C. Scan for High Outbound Data Usage (Livestreaming = Large Uploads)

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

If 
large amounts of data
 were sent out, it might confirm 
a livestream.

Look for unknown apps.

3ï¸â£ Check Browser History for Streaming Activity

If streaming happened 
via browser
, it might still be i
