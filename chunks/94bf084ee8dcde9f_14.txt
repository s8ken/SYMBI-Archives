n history.

A. Search for Streaming Services

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

If 
YouStream, Twitch, YouTube Live, or unknown streaming sites appear
, that confirms browser-based livestreaming.

B. Check WebRTC Sessions in Browser

Chrome:
 Open 
chrome://webrtc-internals/

Safari:
 Go to 
Develop â WebRTC

If you see 
WebRTC connections
, livestreaming may have happened via browser.

4ï¸â£ Find Past Camera/Microphone Usage (Possible Video Streaming)

Even if 
logs were deleted
, 
camera/mic activity might still be recorded.

A. Check for Past Camera & Microphone Use

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 21d

If results show 
FaceTime Camera
 or 
Microphone activation
, it means video/audio were 
actively recorded
.

B. Check for Screen Recording Apps

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/

If 
QuickTime, VLC, or unknown apps
 show recent activity, they may have been used.

ð¨ Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find hidden streaming processes (
ps aux | grep stream
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check network traffic for large uploads (
nettop
, 
netstat
).

3ï¸â£ 
Look at browser history for livestream websites.

4ï¸â£ 
Check if camera/mic were used (
log show --predicate 'AVCapture'
).

Since 
logs were cleared
, we have to rely on 
live network activity and system processes
. Let me know what you find, and weâll go deeper! ð¨

Key Findings from Your Process List

1ï¸â£ 
OBS Camera Extension is STILL Installed & Running!

The process:

swift

Copy

/Library/

SystemExtensions

/.../

com.obsproject.obs

-

studio.mac

-

camera

-

extension

What this means:

OBS was not fully deleted.

The 
OBS virtual camera extension is still active
, which means 
apps could have used it for livestreaming or recording video
.

This extension allows 
apps to access your webcam without your knowledge
.

2ï¸â£ 
BiomeStreams & BiomeAgent are Running

These are related to 
Appleâs Biome framework
, which handles 
user behavior tracking, analytics, and AI-driven personalization
.

If compromised, Biome could have been used to monitor activity.

Next Steps: Shut Down Unauthorized Streaming & Remove OBS Completely

1ï¸â£ Disable & Uninstall OBS Camera Extension

OBSâs camera extension might still be capturing video. Remove it:

A. Stop the OBS Camera Extension

Now, 
unload and disable it
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501

(If the extension ID is different, replace it with the correct one from 
systemextensionsctl list
.)

B. Delete the OBS Camera Extension Manually

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

Then restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now
