ent & BiomeStreams are running
, we need to check what theyâre doing.

A. Check Biome-Related Logs

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "biome"'

 --last 7d

If Biome is transmitting data 
without your knowledge
, it might be a 
privacy risk
.

B. Disable Biome Logging

Apple doesnât let you fully disable 
Biome
, but you can 
block its data collection
:

Go to
 â 
System Settings â Privacy & Security â Analytics & Improvements

Disable
 all options related to analytics.

3ï¸â£ Scan for Any Active Streaming

Since 
OBS was still running a camera extension
, we need to ensure nothing else is livestreaming.

A. Check Again for Streaming Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg\|screencapture"

If anything 
other than Biome or OBS appears
, that could be a 
hidden streaming service
.

B. Find Apps Accessing Your Camera/Microphone

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 7d

If you see logs showing 
camera/mic usage
, it means your video/audio may have been used in a stream.

ð¨ 
Summary: What to Do Next

â 
1. Remove the OBS Camera Extension (
systemextensionsctl uninstall
)

â 
2. Delete the OBS Camera Extension Files (
sudo rm -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/...
)

â 
3. Restart Mac (
sudo shutdown -r now
)

â 
4. Investigate Biome (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "biome"'
)

â 
5. Check for Camera/Mic Access Logs (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'
)

ð¨ 
Since OBSâs camera extension was still running, someone may have had access to your webcam even after uninstalling OBS.
 Remove it completely and let me know if anything else looks suspicious!

no I am not worried about shutting it down given I am aware of it now 

ChatGPT said:

Got itâyou want to 
analyze past livestreaming activity
, not just shut things down. Since we now know 
OBSâs camera extension was active
, letâs focus on 
where video was sent and if anything else streamed without your knowledge.

ð¨ Next Steps: Track Past Livestreaming Activity

Now that we know OBS was at least 
partially active
, we need to answer:

1ï¸â£ 
Where were livestreams sent?

2ï¸â£ 
Was OBS the only streaming tool used?

3ï¸â£ 
Were there any hidden screen or audio streams?

1ï¸â£ Find Past Video Stream Destinations

Since 
OBSâs camera extension was running
, letâs check where 
it or other apps sent video.

A. Check Past Network Connections for Streaming Servers

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If a livestream was active, you should see 
connections to streaming services (Twitch, YouTube, YouStream, etc.).

Now, expand the search to 
past connections
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 21d

ð 
Look for domains like:

rtmp://live.twitch.tv/

rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/

youstream.com

facebook.com/live

If 
unknown IPs
 appear, we can 
trace them back
 to see what services were contacted.

2ï¸â£ Find If Other Apps Were Streaming

Since 
OBS was partially removed
, itâs possible another app was also livestreaming.

A. List All Apps That Had Screen Recording Permissions

Go to 
System Settings â Privacy & Security â Screen Recording

Look for any 
apps other than OBS
 that still have permission.

If something unexpected is listed, it could have been used for a stream.

B. Check If Other Streaming Software Was Running

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg\|screencapture"

If any 
other apps
 appear (like 
ffmpeg
 or 
QuickTime
), they may have streamed video/audio.

C. Check for Background Streaming Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg"

If any 
background streaming services
 are active, this will show them.

3ï¸â£ Check Browser History for Streaming Activity

Since some livestreams can happen through 
browser-based streaming
, check past activity.

A. Search for Streaming Sites

sh

Copy
