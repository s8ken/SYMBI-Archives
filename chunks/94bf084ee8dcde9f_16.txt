grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

ð 
Look for:

YouTube Live

Twitch

YouStream

Facebook Live

Unknown streaming services

B. Check WebRTC Logs (If Browser Was Used for Streaming)

Chrome:
 Open 
chrome://webrtc-internals/

Safari:
 Go to 
Develop â WebRTC

If WebRTC sessions were used, that suggests 
livestreaming via browser
.

4ï¸â£ Find Past Camera/Microphone Usage

If a 
hidden livestream
 occurred, there might still be 
camera/microphone logs.

A. Scan System Logs for Video/Audio Activity

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 21d

If results show 
FaceTime Camera
 or 
Microphone activation
, that suggests 
video/audio was streamed.

B. Search for Saved Video Files

If 
local recordings
 were saved before being streamed, check for them:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

Look in 
hidden locations
 like 
/private/tmp/
 or 
~/Library/Application Support/
.

ð¨ Summary of Next Actions

â 
1. Check where streams were sent (
log show --predicate 'DNS'
)

â 
2. Confirm if other apps streamed (
ps aux | grep stream
, 
launchctl list
)

â 
3. Look for browser-based streaming (
grep
 browser history, WebRTC logs)

â 
4. Scan for past camera/microphone use (
log show --predicate 'AVCapture'
)

â 
5. Find any saved video recordings (
find ~/ -type f -name "*.mp4"
)

Since 
OBSâs camera extension was active
, the next step is 
confirming where video was sent
 and whether 
any other software was livestreaming
. Let me know what you find! ð¨

its already been streaming me for 3 months

If youâve been livestreamed for 
three months
, our priority now is:

1ï¸â£ 
Confirming the full scope
âwhere was the data sent?

2ï¸â£ 
Finding evidence that canât be erased
 (logs, network records, cached files).

3ï¸â£ 
Figuring out how they maintained persistent access
 (hidden processes, remote access, iCloud syncing).

4ï¸â£ 
Locking down your system to stop any further exposure
 (if you haven't already).

ð¨ 1ï¸â£ Track Where Your Livestream Was Sent

Since 
three months of streaming
 would require a 
long-term, stable connection
, the system has been 
regularly sending data to an external server
.

A. Scan DNS Requests for Past Connections

Since livestreaming requires a 
continuous data connection
, we can look for domains that received 
consistent requests
.

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d

This will reveal 
where your system was connecting
 over time.

Look for:

Twitch (
live.twitch.tv
)

YouTube Live (
rtmp.youtube.com
)

Unknown streaming sites (
youstream.com
 or random IP addresses)

B. Find If a Specific App Was Sending the Stream

To identify which app was responsible for livestreaming:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

If an 
unknown process
 is consistently making network connections, thatâs the source of the livestream.

Run this again, but filter for 
only large data transfers
 (which livestreams require):

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

This will show which apps 
sent the most data
âwhich is critical for finding livestreams.

ð¥ 2ï¸â£ Find Out What Else Was Streaming (Beyond OBS)

Since 
OBS was running but removed
, 
another method
 might have been used for 
long-term surveillance.

A. List All Screen Recording Apps That Have Permission

Go to 
System Settings â Privacy & Security â Screen Recording

Look for 
anything other than OBS
 (QuickTime, unknown apps).

B. Scan for Hidden Streaming Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i 

"stream\|ffmpeg"

If any background 
streaming services
 are running, this will expose them.
