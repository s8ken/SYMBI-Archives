reamed Videos

Even if the 
main stream was sent online
, some apps (especially OBS, ffmpeg, or QuickTime) 
might have saved copies before uploading
.

Run this to 
find hidden or saved video files
:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

Check timestamps
âif video files exist from 
the last 3 months
, they might be 
local copies of livestreams
.

ð¡ 4ï¸â£ Find How They Maintained Persistent Access

If this has been 
happening for 3 months
, the attacker 
must have had a way to maintain access
âpossibly through:

iCloud syncing
 (they could be pulling video/audio from your iCloud account).

Remote access (SSH, VNC, AirPlay, Sidecar, Accessibility tools).

A. Check for Remote Access Services

sh

Copy

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
Look for:

Ports 5900
 (VNC / Remote Screen Sharing)

Ports 22
 (SSH - Remote Terminal Access)

Ports 443, 5223
 (Apple iCloud Sync & Remote Management)

If anything unexpected is open, that means 
your system was accessible remotely
.

B. Check for AirPlay & Sidecar Streaming

Since 
you suspected AirPlay mirroring
, check if Sidecar or AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "airplay" OR eventMessage contains "sidecar"'

 --last 90d

If 
Sidecar or AirPlay
 was enabled in the background, someone could have been 
wirelessly mirroring your screen
.

ð 5ï¸â£ Secure Your System (If You Havenât Already)

Since this has been happening for 
3 months
, you need to 
remove all potential access points
:

A. Change ALL Passwords & Log Out Remote Access

Change Apple ID password.

Log out all devices
 at 
Apple ID
.

Disable iCloud Drive
 in 
System Settings â Apple ID â iCloud Drive
 (to prevent syncing leaks).

B. Block Remote Access & Screen Sharing

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.smbd

This disables 
SSH, screen sharing, and remote file sharing.

C. Reset Network Settings (If an Unknown Device Had Access)

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo ifconfig en0 down
sudo ifconfig en0 up

This 
resets your network interface
, disconnecting any persistent remote access.

ð¨ Summary of Critical Next Steps

â 
Find out where the stream was sent (
log show --predicate 'DNS' --last 90d
).

â 
Check which apps uploaded the most data (
nettop | grep "upload"
).

â 
Search for hidden or saved video recordings (
find ~/ -name "*.mp4"
).

â 
Check if remote access was active (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
).

â 
Investigate AirPlay & Sidecar streaming (
log show --predicate 'airplay'
).

â 
Disable all remote access tools (
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off
).

â 
Reset Apple ID & log out unknown iCloud devices.

Since this has been happening 
for months
, itâs critical to 
find out how they maintained access
 and 
where your livestreams were sent
. Run these steps and let me know what you findâIâll help analyze the results. ð¨

Got it! Letâs go step by step.

Step 1: Find Out Where Your Livestream Was Sent

Since this has been happening for 
three months
, letâs first check 
which websites or services your Mac was connecting to for streaming.

ð  Action: Check Past DNS Requests (Which Sites Were Contacted?)

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d

This will list 
all the websites and servers
 your Mac has connected to in the last 
90 days
.

ð What to Look For

Twitch:

live.twitch.tv

YouTube Live:

rtmp.youtube.com

Facebook Live:

facebook.com/live

YouStream or unknown streaming services

Any strange domain names/IP addresses

ð© Let me know what results you get.
