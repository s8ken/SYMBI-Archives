The file contains 
a lot of network and DNS logs
, but I don't see any obvious streaming-related domains (like Twitch, YouTube Live, or YouStream). The logs mainly show 
Apple system processes, local network changes, and DNS service updates.

ð  Next Step: Extract Only Streaming-Related Entries

Since this file contains 
a lot of general network activity
, let's 
filter only for potential livestreaming services
 so we donât have to go through unnecessary data.

â Run This Command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"twitch|youtube|stream|rtmp|webrtc|hls|live"

This will:

Remove unnecessary system messages.

Show only DNS queries related to 
streaming, RTMP, WebRTC, or live broadcasts.

ð© What to Do Next

1ï¸â£ 
Run the command above in Terminal.

2ï¸â£ 
If the list is long, save it to a file and upload it here:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"twitch|youtube|stream|rtmp|webrtc|hls|live"

 > ~/Desktop/filtered_streaming_logs.txt

3ï¸â£ 
Let me know what results you get!

ð¨ If this still doesnât show anything, weâll take another approach by checking 
browser history and network uploads instead.

the material itself if pornographic in nature and this is designed as a doxing or reaction video attempt - it will not be on major platforms 

ChatGPT said:

Understoodâthis makes things more complex because it means the 
livestream was likely sent to a private or obscure platform
, not mainstream services like 
Twitch or YouTube Live.

We need to take a 
different approach
 to 
find where the data was sent
 and 
how they maintained access.

ð  Step 1: Look for Unknown Streaming Servers

Since this was not on 
major platforms
, we need to find 
any unknown IPs or domains
 that may have received the stream.

â Run This in Terminal to Extract Suspicious Connections

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"live|stream|rtmp|cdn|video|upload"

ð 
What to Look For:

Unknown domain names
 (not Twitch, YouTube, or known websites).

CDN services
 (content delivery networks that store video).

Raw IP addresses
 instead of domain names (suggesting a private server).

ð© 
If you see anything strange, copy it here, and Iâll help analyze it.

ð¥ Step 2: Check for Hidden Remote Access (To Maintain Streaming)

Since this has been happening 
for months
, they likely 
maintained access to your Mac
.

â Run This to Check for Remote Access:

sh

Copy

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
Look for Suspicious Open Ports:

5900
 â VNC (Remote Screen Sharing)

22
 â SSH (Remote Terminal Access)

443, 5223
 â Apple iCloud Sync & Remote Access

Any unknown ports

ð¨ 
If a strange port is open, it may be how they controlled your Mac.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Run the DNS search (
log show --predicate 'DNS' | grep "stream"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Run the remote access check (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
).

3ï¸â£ 
Copy any unknown IPs, ports, or domains here, and Iâll help analyze them.

This will 
help track where the video was sent
 and 
how they kept control of your device.
 Let me know what you find! ð¨

File

ChatGPT said:

Your logs contain 
a lot of Apple system activity
 (related to video processing, wallpapers, Photos, and videoconferencing), but I donât see any 
clear evidence of livestreaming to an external service
 yet.

Key Findings So Far:

1ï¸â£ 
Apple VideoConference & CoreMedia Processes

This suggests 
video was processed
, but it doesnât confirm streaming.

It could be 
FaceTime, QuickTime, or a third-party app accessing the camera.

2ï¸â£ 
No Obvious Streaming Platforms Found

No 
RTMP, WebRTC, or external livestreaming servers
 were found.

This suggests the 
streaming was either hidden or logs were cleared.
