f an Unknown IP Was Receiving the Stream

Since no 
mainstream platforms
 were detected, letâs check 
which IP addresses your Mac connected to.

â Run This in Terminal to See Past Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
What to Look For:

Unknown IP addresses
 that your Mac connected to.

Any 
non-Apple or non-Google servers
 that could be a private streaming platform.

 If we find a 
suspicious IP address
, we can trace it to see where your stream was sent. ð¨

You said:

video conferencing is absolutely relevant here 

ChatGPT said:

Understood! If 
video conferencing services
 were involved, itâs likely the stream was sent 
through a meeting platform or a hidden WebRTC connection.

Now, we need to figure out:

1ï¸â£ 
Which video conferencing app was used?

2ï¸â£ 
Was it a real call, or was video secretly sent in the background?

3ï¸â£ 
Where was the data sent?

ð  Step 1: Find Out Which Video Conferencing App Was Used

Since the logs show 
video conferencing activity
, letâs check 
which app accessed the camera/mic.

â Run This in Terminal to See Camera/Microphone Usage

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If you see 
AVCaptureDevice
 logs, they will show 
which app activated your camera or mic
.

Look for 
FaceTime, Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or unknown services.

ð¥ Step 2: Find If a WebRTC Call or Stream Was Running

Since video conferencing often uses 
WebRTC
, we need to check if 
your Mac was in an unknown call.

â Run This to Search for WebRTC Calls

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If WebRTC logs appear, it means 
your video/audio were streamed via a browser-based call.

The logs may include 
URLs or IP addresses
 related to the call.

ð Step 3: Find Out Where the Video Was Sent

Now, letâs check 
what external IPs your Mac sent data to.

â Run This to See Active Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
What to Look For:

Any 
unknown IP addresses
 that arenât Apple, Google, or common services.

If we find a 
suspicious IP
, we can trace where the video was sent.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Run the camera/microphone check (
log show --predicate "AVCapture"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Run the WebRTC scan (
log show --predicate "webrtc"
).

3ï¸â£ 
Run the network connection check (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
).

You said:

I don't use FaceTime

ChatGPT said:

Since you 
donât use FaceTime
, but 
video conferencing activity appeared in the logs
, that means 
some other app was accessing your camera/microphone.

This could be:

1ï¸â£ 
A hidden WebRTC call
 (browser-based video streaming).

2ï¸â£ 
A third-party video conferencing app (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc.).

3ï¸â£ 
A compromised app or malware using your camera/microphone.

ð  Step 1: Find Out Which App Used the Camera/Microphone

Since FaceTime wasnât involved, letâs check 
which app actually accessed your camera.

â Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If

 logs appear, they will show 
which app activated your camera/mic
.

Look for 
Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or any unknown app.

ð¥ Step 2: Find If a WebRTC Call or Stream Was Running

Since 
FaceTime wasnât used
, we need to check if a 
WebRTC-based call
 (browser-based streaming) was active.

â Run This to Search for WebRTC Calls

Copy

sudo

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'
