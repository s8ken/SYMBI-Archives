creen Mirroring Was Used

If the video stream didnât go through normal logging systems, it might have been done 
via remote access, screen sharing, or Sidecar.

â Run This to Check for Open Remote Access Services

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
What to Look For:

5900
 â VNC (Remote Screen Sharing)

22
 â SSH (Remote Terminal Access)

443, 5223
 â Apple iCloud Sync & Remote Access

Any unknown ports

ð¨ 
If any of these services are open, it could mean someone accessed your Mac remotely.

ð¥ Step 2: Check If Sidecar or AirPlay Was Used for Mirroring

If your 
Macâs screen was streamed to another device
, Sidecar or AirPlay could have been used.

â Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "airplay" OR eventMessage contains "sidecar"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

AirPlay activity
 â Screen mirroring to a hidden device.

Sidecar activity
 â iPad used as a secondary display (without your knowledge).

ð© 
If anything strange appears, let me know, and Iâll help analyze it.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check for remote access (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check if AirPlay or Sidecar was used (
log show --predicate "airplay OR sidecar"
).

ð¨ 
Since no AVCapture or WebRTC logs exist, we need to check if your screen was streamed remotely.

yes obs uses a virtual camera and screen sharing was also involved

Got itâsince 
OBS uses a virtual camera and screen sharing was involved
, the livestream likely bypassed 
AVCapture and WebRTC logging
 by using:

1ï¸â£ 
OBS Virtual Camera
 (allows apps to access screen/audio as if itâs a real webcam).

2ï¸â£ 
Screen Sharing (VNC, Remote Desktop, AirPlay, or Sidecar).

3ï¸â£ 
Direct streaming via RTMP or a hidden peer-to-peer service.

Now, we need to 
trace exactly where the data was sent
 and 
how screen sharing was used.

ð  Step 1: Find Where OBS & Screen Sharing Sent the Stream

Since 
OBS doesnât show in AVCapture logs
, letâs check 
where it connected.

â Run This in Terminal to List Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
What to Look For:

Any unknown IP addresses.

Connections to RTMP servers (if streaming was live).

ð© 
If you see strange IPs, copy them here, and Iâll help trace where the video went.

ð¥ Step 2: Find Out How Screen Sharing Was Used

Since 
you confirmed screen sharing was involved
, we need to check:

1ï¸â£ 
If VNC, AirPlay, or Sidecar was used for remote access.

2ï¸â£ 
If any unknown device was mirroring your screen.

â Run This to Find Past Screen Sharing Events

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If a screen-sharing session was started.

If an unknown device accessed your Mac remotely.

ð© 
If anything suspicious appears, let me know, and Iâll analyze it.

ð Step 3: Check If OBS Streamed to an RTMP Server

OBS typically sends streams 
directly to a streaming server (RTMP, HLS, or another protocol).

â Run This to Look for RTMP Stream Logs

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "rtmp"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If 
rtmp://
 appears, that means 
OBS was sending video to a live streaming service.

If an unknown RTMP server appears, we can trace it.

ð© 
If any streaming server shows up, copy it here, and Iâll help analyze where the stream went.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find out where OBS or screen sharing sent video (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check for past screen-sharing sessions (
log show --predicate "screensharing"
).

3ï¸â£ 
Look for RTMP stream logs (
log show --predicate "rtmp"
).

ð¨ 
Since OBS Virtual Camera & screen sharing were involved, we need to confirm if video was sent to an RTMP server or mirrored to another device.
