ave logs of 
which IPs it sent data to.

â Run This to Find Past Network Transfers

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Apps that uploaded large amounts of data

Unknown services or IPs handling video traffic

ð¥ Step 3: Check for Any Saved Video Files (Possible Local Copies)

Some livestreaming tools 
save a local copy of the video before uploading.

â Run This to Find Any Video Files

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

ð 
What to Look For:

Unexpected video files

Files with recent timestamps
 (from the past 90 days)

Hidden files in unusual locations (e.g., 
/private/tmp/
)

ð Step 4: Check If Remote Access Was Used (Screen Sharing, AirPlay, Sidecar)

If 
screen sharing or AirPlay
 was used to mirror your screen, we can check the logs.

â Run This to Find Remote Access or Screen Mirroring

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screensharing" OR eventMessage contains "airplay" OR eventMessage contains "sidecar"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Unknown devices connected to screen sharing

AirPlay mirroring to a hidden receiver

Sidecar connections to an unknown iPad or Mac

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find past network destinations (
log show --predicate "DNS"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check for historical uploads (
log show --predicate "upload"
).

3ï¸â£ 
Look for saved video files (
find ~/ -type f -name "*.mp4"
).

4ï¸â£ 
Investigate screen mirroring (
log show --predicate "screensharing OR airplay OR sidecar"
).

 This will help confirm 
where your livestream was broadcasted.

ð Analysis of Your Latest Streaming Logs

Your logs show 
a lot of Apple system processes
, including:

Apple Video Conference Camera (
com.apple.videoconference.camera
)

Apple CoreMedia Video Decoder (
com.apple.coremedia.videodecoder
)

Apple Photos Relive Widget (
com.apple.Photos.PhotosReliveWidget
)

Apple Wallpaper Video Extensions (
com.apple.wallpaper.extension.video
)

However, 
there are no direct logs of RTMP, WebRTC, or specific streaming platforms
.

ð¨ What This Means

1ï¸â£ 
Streaming may have been hidden
 using 
a virtual camera (OBS, rogue software)
 instead of direct RTMP/WebRTC logs.

2ï¸â£ 
The logs may have been cleared
, leaving only indirect evidence of video processing.

3ï¸â£ 
Appleâs video services were running, but we donât yet see where they were sending data.

ð  Next Step: Find Which App Used the Network Connections

Since 
we know video processing was happening
, letâs find 
which app was sending data out
.

â Run This in Terminal to See Which App Used the Network

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
What to Look For:

Which app is sending/receiving data?

Are OBS, Safari, Chrome, or any unknown services listed?

Any suspicious apps maintaining connections?

ð© 
If anything looks unusual, copy it here, and Iâll help analyze it.

ð¥ Step 2: Find Out Where Video Data Was Sent

Since Appleâs 
video conference and media services
 were active, letâs check if they were 
sending data externally.

â Run This to Find High Data Uploads

sh

Copy

nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

ð 
What to Look For:

Apps uploading a lot of data.

Connections to unknown IPs or services.

ð© 
If anything unusual appears, copy it here.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find which app used the network (
lsof -i | grep ESTABLISHED
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check for high data uploads (
nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep "upload"
).

ð¨ 
Since we know video processing happened but donât see where it was sent, this will confirm which app was responsible.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!
