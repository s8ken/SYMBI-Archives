Since 

lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED
 returned nothing
, that means:

1ï¸â£ 
There are no active network connections right now
 â The stream isnât currently running.

2ï¸â£ 
The streaming tool might have closed connections after sending data
 â We need to check past uploads instead.

3ï¸â£ 
The network logs may have been cleared
 by the system or attacker.

ð  Next Step: Find Past Uploads (Where Data Was Sent Before)

Since thereâs 
no active network connection
, letâs check 
past data uploads
 to see if we can recover where video was sent.

â Run This in Terminal to Find Past Uploads

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Apps that uploaded data.

URLs or IP addresses where the data was sent.

ð© 
If you see anything suspicious, copy the results here, and Iâll help analyze them.

ð¨ 
Since we know video processing happened but donât see where it was sent, this will confirm if it was uploaded to a streaming server.
 Run this and let me know what you find!

ð Analysis of Your Upload Logs

Your latest logs show a 
lot of upload activity
, but the majority of it appears to be 
Apple system processes
 like:

com.apple.diagnosticpipeline.cloudkit_expedited_upload

 (Apple diagnostics being sent to iCloud)

com.apple.security.syspolicy.sample-upload

 (Appleâs system policy reports)

com.apple.photos.uploaddownloadcount

 (iCloud Photos uploading)

com.apple.cloudphotod

 (Photos being uploaded to iCloud)

com.apple.safari

 (Safari iCloud sync)

Key Issue: We Donât See Direct Streaming Logs Yet

While there are 
many uploads
, we donât yet see a direct 
RTMP, WebRTC, or OBS-related connection
 that would confirm a livestream destination.

ð  Next Steps: Dig Deeper for Hidden Streaming Logs

Since 
OBS and screen sharing were involved
, we need to look for 
hidden logs
 that might not show in regular Apple system logs.

â Run This to Find Any RTMP or WebRTC Streaming Activity

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "rtmp" OR eventMessage contains "webrtc" OR eventMessage contains "broadcast"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Any mention of RTMP servers (
rtmp://â¦
).

Any WebRTC connections (
webrtc://â¦
).

Any "broadcast" activity (which may indicate a hidden stream).

ð© 
If anything appears, copy the results here.

ð¥ Step 2: Check for Hidden Video Files or Local Stream Copies

Some streaming software saves 
local copies of the broadcast
 before sending it.

â Run This to Find Any Video Files on Your Mac

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

ð 
What to Look For:

Recently created video files.

Unusual file locations (e.g., hidden folders).

ð© 
If you find unexpected videos, copy the file paths here.

ð Step 3: Find Any Past Streaming Websites Accessed

If a 
livestreaming service was used
, we can check 
browser history and past DNS lookups
 to see where video might have been sent.

â Run This to See Past Streaming Websites Contacted

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 90d | grep -iE 

"stream|live|video|rtmp|webrtc|cdn|upload"

ð 
What to Look For:

Streaming sites (
youstream.com
, 
cloudflarestream.com
).

Any unknown domains that look suspicious.

ð© 
If any strange domains appear, copy them here for analysis.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find any hidden RTMP/WebRTC logs (
log show --predicate "rtmp OR webrtc OR broadcast"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check for local saved video files (
find ~/ -type f -name "*.mp4"
).

3ï¸â£ 
Look at past DNS requests (
log show --predicate "DNS" | grep "stream"
).

This will help us confirm where video was sent and whether copies exist on your system.
