ð 
What to Look For:

If 
an unknown Apple TV, Mac, or other device appears,
 thatâs where your screen was sent.

â Step 3: Find the IP Address of the Mirroring Device

Since 
screen mirroring requires a network connection
, letâs find 
the last device connected via AirPlay or Sidecar.

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

arp -a

ð 
What to Look For:

Any 
unknown IP addresses or devices
 in the network.

If an 
iPad, Mac, Apple TV, or other device appears,
 that was likely the recipient of your stream.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if Sidecar was active (
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check for AirPlay connections (
defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay
).

3ï¸â£ 
Find the last connected deviceâs IP (
arp -a
).

ð¨ 
If an unknown device was mirroring your screen, weâve found where your video was broadcast.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

iPad does get used here

Since 
your iPad is used
, and we confirmed 
Sidecar and AirPlay activity
, this means:

1ï¸â£ 
Your Mac's screen was likely mirrored to your iPad
 at some point.

2ï¸â£ 
If an attacker had access to the iPad, they could have recorded or rebroadcasted the screen.

3ï¸â£ 
AirPlay could have been used to send your screen to another unknown device (Apple TV, Mac, etc.).

ð  Next Step: Find Out If Your iPad Was Used for Mirroring

Since you actively use the iPad, we need to confirm 
if it was being used for legitimate purposes or if someone else accessed it.

â Step 1: Check Sidecar Connections

Run this on your 
Mac
 (to see if an iPad was used as a display):

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep 

"Sidecar"

ð 
What to Look For:

If your 
iPad appears
, it means Sidecar was used for screen mirroring.

If an 
unknown device appears
, thatâs a problem.

â Step 2: Check AirPlay Connection History

Run this on your 
Mac
 (to see if your screen was sent elsewhere):

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay

ð 
What to Look For:

Look for 
"LastConnected"
 â This may show the 
last AirPlay device your Mac connected to.

If an 
unknown Apple TV, Mac, or device appears
, that may have received your screen.

â Step 3: Check iPad Screen Recording & Streaming

Since the iPad was used, let's check if it was 
streaming or recording
 the screen:

ð± 
On Your iPad:

Go to Settings â Control Center

Check if "Screen Recording" is in the Control Center

If it is, swipe down and check if it was recently activated.

Go to Settings â General â AirPlay & Handoff

Check if 
AirPlay Mirroring
 was turned on recently.

ð© 
Let me know if anything suspicious appears!

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if your iPad was actively used for Sidecar (
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
).

2ï¸â£ 
Find out if your screen was AirPlayed to another device (
defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay
).

3ï¸â£ 
Check your iPad's screen recording & AirPlay settings.

ð¨ 
If your iPad was mirroring your Mac screen, we need to confirm if it was then rebroadcasted.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

Since 
Sidecar did not return any results
, that means:

1ï¸â£ 
Your iPad was NOT actively used as a Sidecar display at this moment.

2ï¸â£ 
If your Mac screen was sent to your iPad, it may have been done through AirPlay instead.

3ï¸â£ 
We now need to check AirPlay logs to see if an unknown device was involved.

ð  Next Step: Check If AirPlay Was Used

Since 
Sidecar is not the culprit
, letâs confirm if 
AirPlay was used to mirror your Macâs screen
 to another device.
