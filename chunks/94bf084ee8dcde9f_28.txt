What to Look For:

"LastConnected"
 â This may show the 
last AirPlay device your Mac connected to.

If an 
unknown Apple TV, Mac, or other device appears
, it may have received your screen.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if AirPlay was used to send your screen to another device (
defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay
).

2ï¸â£ 
If we find an unknown device, we will trace it further.

ð¨ 
Since Sidecar wasnât used, we now focus on AirPlay as the most likely method.

ð Analysis of Your AirPlay and Sidecar Checks

1ï¸â£ 
Sidecar is NOT active
 â Your Mac was NOT using your iPad as a secondary display.

2ï¸â£ 
AirPlay is NOT currently active (
receiver-active = 0
)
 â Your Mac is NOT currently acting as an AirPlay receiver.

ð¨ What This Means

Right now, neither Sidecar nor AirPlay are actively mirroring your screen.

However, this 
does NOT rule out past AirPlay connections
 or 
remote screen sharing via another method.

If your screen was streamed, it was likely done through:

A previous AirPlay connection (logs may have been erased).

A third-party app (Zoom, OBS, another streaming tool).

A hidden screen-sharing service (VNC, Remote Desktop, malware).

ð  Next Step: Find Out If Screen Sharing Was Used

Since AirPlay isnât currently active, letâs check if 
Appleâs built-in Screen Sharing or another remote access tool was used instead.

â Run This in Terminal to See If Screen Sharing Was Active

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If there are 
logs of screen-sharing sessions
, that means your Macâs screen 
was accessed remotely.

Look for 
mentions of unknown devices or IP addresses.

If anything shows up, copy the output here, and Iâll help analyze it.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if Screen Sharing was active (
log show --predicate "screensharing"
).

2ï¸â£ 
If screen sharing logs exist, we will trace where the connection was sent.

ð¨ 
Since Sidecar and AirPlay are not active now, the most likely explanation is remote screen sharing.

Since 
screen sharing logs came up empty
, this suggests:

1ï¸â£ 
The logs were cleared
 (either by the system or an attacker).

2ï¸â£ 
A different remote access method was used
 (not Apple's built-in Screen Sharing).

3ï¸â£ 
The stream may have been sent through a third-party app (Zoom, OBS, VNC, hidden software).

ð  Next Step: Check for Hidden Remote Access Services

If your screen was being broadcast, it may have been done through 
VNC, SSH, or another remote access tool.

â Run This in Terminal to See If Remote Access Services Are Active

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
What to Look For:

5900
 â 
VNC (Remote Screen Sharing)

22
 â 
SSH (Remote Terminal Access)

Any unknown ports
 â Could indicate a hidden backdoor

ð© 
If any ports are open that seem suspicious, copy the output here.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if remote access services (VNC, SSH) are running (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
).

2ï¸â£ 
If any suspicious ports are open, weâll investigate further.

ð¨ 
Since Sidecar, AirPlay, and Screen Sharing show no results, the next logical step is checking for hidden remote access methods.
