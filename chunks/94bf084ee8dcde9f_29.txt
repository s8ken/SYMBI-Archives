Understood. Whenever you're ready to continue investigating, just let me know. Stay safe. ð¨

I mean we need to look at historical nor current

ChatGPT said:

Got it! We need to 
look at historical remote access activity
, not just whatâs currently running. This will help determine if someone 
previously had access to your screen
 or 
remotely controlled your Mac
 for streaming.

ð  Step 1: Find Historical Remote Access (VNC, SSH, Remote Desktop)

Since 
we didnât find active connections
, letâs check 
past logs
 for any 
remote access events.

â Run This in Terminal to Find Past Remote Access

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "remote"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Mentions of "Remote Login," "VNC," "Screen Sharing," or "SSH".

Any unknown devices or IPs connecting to your Mac.

ð© 
If anything appears, copy the output here, and Iâll help analyze it.

ð¥ Step 2: Check If Remote Desktop (RDP) or VNC Was Used

Since 
Appleâs Screen Sharing logs were empty
, weâll check if 
Remote Desktop or VNC were used.

â Run This to Find VNC/Remote Desktop Logs

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "vnc" OR eventMessage contains "rdp"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

VNC connections (
com.apple.vncserver
).

Remote Desktop Protocol (
com.microsoft.rdp
).

Unknown IPs accessing your Mac.

ð© 
If any remote access activity appears, copy it here.

ð Step 3: Find Any Historical SSH (Remote Terminal) Access

If an attacker had access, they may have used 
SSH (Secure Shell) to remotely control your Mac.

â Run This to Find Past SSH Connections

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "ssh"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Logins from unknown IPs.

Repeated SSH access attempts.

ð© 
If anything suspicious appears, copy the output here.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find past remote access logs (
log show --predicate "remote"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check for VNC or Remote Desktop activity (
log show --predicate "vnc OR rdp"
).

3ï¸â£ 
Look for historical SSH logins (
log show --predicate "ssh"
).

ð¨ 
Since we know screen sharing and streaming happened, these steps will help confirm if remote access was involved.
 Run these and let me know what you find!

ð Analysis of Your Remote Access Logs

Your logs 
confirm remote management activity
 on your system, specifically:

1ï¸â£ 
Remote Management Tasks Were Scheduled & Synced

com.apple.remotemanagement.on-reboot

com.apple.remotemanagement.periodic-sync

These indicate 
some form of remote management system was active
, possibly Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) or another tool.

2ï¸â£ 
Media Remote & AirPlay Activity

com.apple.mediaremote
 errors suggest 
media control or streaming was attempted.

com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent
 shows AirPlay 
was at least running
, even if not currently active.

3ï¸â£ 
System Processes Handling Media & Video

com.apple.videoconference.camera
 was running â 
Possible webcam or virtual camera access.

com.apple.coremedia.videodecoder
 â 
Video processing may have occurred.

ð¨ What This Means

Remote management was enabled at some point
, meaning 
someone could have remotely controlled your system.

Media remote and video processes were running
, suggesting 
screen sharing or video access was happening.

Even though AirPlay isnât active now, it was involved in past system events.

ð  Next Step: Find Out Who Connected Remotely

Now we need to find 
who used remote access
 and 
where they connected from.

â Step 1: Check for Remote Login (SSH) Attempts

Run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "sshd"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If there are 
logins from unknown IPs
, someone may have accessed your system via SSH.
