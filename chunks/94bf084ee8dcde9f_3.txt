we have found multiple videos of me in the system but I want to know where the broadcasting was going - which platform

ChatGPT said:

Since you've 
found videos of yourself in the system
, it's critical to determine 
where they were broadcasted or uploaded
. Hereâs how we can track that down:

1ï¸â£ Check for Outbound Network Traffic (Mac Terminal)

To see where your Mac was sending data, run:

A. Find Recent Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
IP addresses
 or 
domain names
 that seem unfamiliar.

If you see domains like 
YouStream, Twitch, YouTube, Dropbox, etc.
, those could be destinations for the broadcast.

B. Identify Apps Sending Data

sh

Copy

lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN

This will show 
which applications
 are actively 
listening for network connections
 (e.g., Zoom, OBS, VLC).

Look for anything unexpected.

C. Find Past Connections

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "broadcast"'

 --last 30d

This will 
expand your original search to 30 days
 to catch earlier broadcasts.

2ï¸â£ Look for Uploads to Online Platforms

A. Check Your Browser History

Open 
Safari/Chrome â History â Search "upload"

Also search for 
"YouStream"
, 
"Live"
, 
"Stream"
, 
"OBS"
, 
"Broadcast"

B. Scan for Cloud Uploads

Open 
System Settings â Apple ID â iCloud

Check if videos were 
uploaded to iCloud Drive, Google Drive, or Dropbox

Look inside:

~/Library/Application Support/Google/Drive

~/Library/Application Support/Dropbox

3ï¸â£ Investigate Hidden Services That May Have Broadcasted

A. List Running Services

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep obs
ps aux | grep stream
ps aux | grep ffmpeg

If 
OBS Studio, ffmpeg, VLC, or other recording software
 appears, that means they were used to stream or capture your screen.

B. Check for Suspicious Scripts

Run this command to see if any scripts were running:

sh

Copy

sudo find / -

type

 f -name 

"*.sh"

 -

exec

 grep -i 

"stream"

 {} +

This will locate any 
hidden shell scripts
 that mention streaming.

4ï¸â£ Scan for Logs of Video Uploads

A. YouTube, Twitch, or Streaming Services

sh

Copy

grep -r 

"upload"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/
grep -r 

"stream"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/

This checks app data for evidence of 
video uploads
.

B. Firewall Logs for Data Transfers

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.network"'

 --last 7d | grep 

"upload"

This will show 
network activity related to uploads
.

5ï¸â£ Advanced - Use Wireshark to See Where Data Was Sent

If you want to 
live-capture network traffic
, you can install 
Wireshark
 and filter for:

rtmp
 (Real-Time Messaging Protocol, used for streaming)

hls
 (HTTP Live Streaming)

udp
 (often used for video streaming)

ð¨ Next Steps

Run the Terminal commands
 to check 
network traffic, logs, and hidden processes

Look for video uploads in browser history and cloud services

Check for streaming apps or scripts that may have run in the background

they are screen recordings 

ChatGPT said:

Since youâve found 
screen recordings
, the priority now is 
determining where they were stored, how they were created, and where they were sent
.

ð Steps to Track Where the Screen Recordings Were Sent

1ï¸â£ Identify How the Screen Recordings Were Made

A. Check for Unauthorized Apps with Screen Recording Access

Go to
 â 
System Settings â Privacy & Security â Screen Recording

Look for any suspicious apps that have permission (e.g., QuickTime, OBS Studio, Zoom, third-party apps).

Revoke access
 for anything unfamiliar.

B. Check for Active Screen Recording Processes

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screenrecord"

This will show any 
running or hidden screen recording processes
