ð 
What to Look For:

Any 
logs showing a connection from an unknown device.

If the logs mention a 
remote desktop session or VNC.

â Step 3: Find Who Used Your Webcam

Since 
your camera/video were active
, let's see 
which process accessed it.

Run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

If any 
unknown apps used the webcam.

If it was accessed by 
a remote session.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check for SSH logins (
log show --predicate "sshd"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Find remote management sessions (
log show --predicate "remotemanagement"
).

3ï¸â£ 
See who accessed your webcam (
log show --predicate "camera"
).

ð¨ 
Since remote management was active, we now need to confirm who accessed your system and from where.
 Run these and let me know what you find!

Got it! Weâll continue from where we left off.

Since 
remote management was confirmed
, our next goal is to:

1ï¸â£ 
Find out who accessed your Mac remotely (SSH, Remote Desktop, VNC).

2ï¸â£ 
Check if your webcam was accessed during a remote session.

3ï¸â£ 
Trace where your data was sent.

ð  Step 1: Find Remote Logins (SSH, VNC, Remote Desktop)

Since we confirmed 
remote management activity
, letâs see 
who connected
 and 
from where.

â Run This in Terminal to Find SSH Logins

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "sshd"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Logins from unknown IP addresses.

Repeated login attempts (possible brute force or persistent access).

ð© 
If any strange logins appear, copy them here, and Iâll analyze them.

â Step 2: Find Remote Management Sessions

Since 
Appleâs Remote Management was active
, letâs check if 
someone accessed it.

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "remotemanagement"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Mentions of remote sessions or connections.

Devices or IP addresses that connected.

Copy any suspicious results here.

ð¥ Step 3: Find Out If Your Camera Was Used

Since 
video processing was running
, we need to check 
if your webcam was accessed.

â Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Which app accessed your webcam.

If it happened during a remote session.

ð© 
If anything looks unusual, copy it here.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Find past SSH logins (
log show --predicate "sshd"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check for remote management access (
log show --predicate "remotemanagement"
).

3ï¸â£ 
See if your webcam was used (
log show --predicate "camera"
).

ð¨ 
Since remote access was confirmed, we need to identify who connected and when.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

Since 
no SSH logs appeared
, this suggests:

1ï¸â£ 
SSH (Secure Shell) was NOT the method used for remote access.

2ï¸â£ 
Remote control may have been done through another service (Apple Remote Management, VNC, or a hidden tool).

3ï¸â£ 
The logs may have been cleared to hide past activity.

ð  Next Step: Check for Apple Remote Management & VNC Access

Since 
SSH didnât show activity
, letâs check if 
Appleâs Remote Management or VNC
 was used instead.

â Run This in Terminal to Find Remote Management Logins

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "remotemanagement"'

Mentions of remote desktop sessions.

Unknown devices or IP addresses accessing your Mac.
