Sharing) Logins

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "vnc"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Any VNC connections.

Possible remote screen-sharing attempts.

ð© 
If something suspicious shows up, let me know.

ð¥ Step 3: Check If Your Camera Was Used

Since 
video processing was running
, we need to confirm if your 
webcam was accessed.

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Which app accessed your webcam?

Did it happen during a remote session?

ð© 
Copy any unusual results here.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check for remote management access (
log show --predicate "remotemanagement"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Find VNC screen sharing attempts (
log show --predicate "vnc"
).

3ï¸â£ 
Check if the webcam was accessed (
log show --predicate "camera"
).

ð¨ 
If remote access happened, it wasnât through SSH, but likely VNC or Apple Remote Management.

ð Analysis of Your SSH Logs

Your logs 
confirm that SSH (
sshd
) was involved in a system migration process on

February 25, 2025
. The key findings:

1ï¸â£ 
SSH Configuration Was Migrated

Log entry: "will migrate a rule: Copy 'sshd_config' to Alt. Location"

This suggests that 
SSH settings were altered or moved.

Possible explanations:

A system update or migration moved SSH settings.

An attacker tampered with SSH settings
 to enable remote access.

2ï¸â£ 
SSH User Identified as 
_sshd
 (System Account)

Entry: "Processing '_sshd' (GID: 75 UID: ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF0000004B)"

_sshd
 is the 
default system account for SSH connections.

If an attacker used SSH, they might have hidden logs or modified this account.

ð¨ What This Means

SSH was definitely involved in a system-level migration.

Thereâs no direct proof of a remote connection (yet), but the SSH configuration was modified.

An attacker could have enabled persistent SSH access and hidden logs.

ð  Next Steps: Find If SSH Was Used for Remote Access

Since we now know 
SSH settings were modified
, letâs check 
if anyone actually logged in.

â Step 1: Check SSH Login History

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see past SSH logins:

sh

Copy

last | grep 

"sshd"

ð 
What to Look For:

Any remote IPs that logged into SSH.

Suspicious login attempts.

ð© 
If anything strange appears, copy the results here.

â Step 2: Check If SSH Remote Login Is Enabled

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see if SSH is currently enabled:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

ð 
If it says 
Remote Login: On

, then SSH is still enabled â meaning 
someone could be accessing your Mac remotely.

ð© 
Let me know what it says!

â Step 3: Check the SSH Configuration File

Since the logs mention 
sshd_config
 was modified, letâs see whatâs inside it:

sh

Copy

cat

 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

ð 
What to Look For:

PermitRootLogin yes

 â Allows attackers to log in as root.

AllowUsers
 or 
AllowGroups

 â See if any unknown users are listed.

Any unknown IPs or commands.

ð© 
If you see anything unusual, copy the lines here.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check past SSH logins (
last | grep "sshd"
).

2ï¸â£ 
See if SSH is still enabled (
systemsetup -getremotelogin
).

3ï¸â£ 
Inspect the SSH config file for suspicious settings (
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
).

ð¨ 
Since SSH settings were modified, we need to confirm if it was used for unauthorized access.
 Run these checks and let me know what you find!
