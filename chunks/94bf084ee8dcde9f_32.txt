rlier), but thereâs no proof of direct remote logins.

ð  Next Step: Confirm If SSH Remote Login Is Still Enabled

Even if no past logins appear, SSH 
might still be active
, allowing someone to connect in the future.

â Run This in Terminal to Check If SSH Remote Login Is Enabled

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

ð 
What to Look For:

If it says 

Remote Login: On

, SSH is still open and can be accessed remotely.

If it says 

Remote Login: Off

, SSH is disabled, meaning no one can use it.

ð© 
Let me know the result!

ð¯ Step 2: Check SSH Configuration for Suspicious Entries

Since we saw that 
sshd_config
 was modified, letâs inspect its contents.

â Run This in Terminal to View SSH Config File

sh

Copy

cat

 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

ð 
What to Look For:

PermitRootLogin yes

 â Allows remote root access (risky).

AllowUsers
 or 
AllowGroups

 â Lists users allowed to log in via SSH.

Any unknown usernames, IPs, or modifications.

ð© 
If anything looks strange, copy the lines here.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if SSH is still enabled (
systemsetup -getremotelogin
).

2ï¸â£ 
Look for suspicious settings in the SSH config file (
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
).

ð¨ 
Since SSH settings were modified, we need to confirm if itâs still open and secure.
 Run these steps and let me know what you find!

ð Analysis of SSH Remote Login Status

â 
SSH Remote Login is OFF
 â This means 
no one can currently access your Mac via SSH.

What this confirms:

SSH was modified in the past
, but 
itâs not active now.

If an attacker used SSH before, they likely disabled it to avoid detection.

There may have been another method used for remote access (VNC, hidden services).

ð  Next Step: Check If Any Suspicious SSH Settings Were Left Behind

Even though SSH is 
off
, an attacker may have 
left backdoor access in the SSH config file.

â Run This in Terminal to Check SSH Configuration

sh

Copy

cat

 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

ð 
What to Look For:

PermitRootLogin yes

 â This would allow direct root access (should be 
no
).

AllowUsers
 or 
AllowGroups

 â Lists usernames allowed to connect via SSH.

Any unknown IP addresses or settings.

ð© 
If you see anything suspicious, copy the lines here, and Iâll help analyze them.

ð¯ Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check SSH config file for hidden access (
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
).

2ï¸â£ 
If thereâs nothing suspicious, weâll shift focus to checking for past VNC or Remote Desktop access.

ð¨ 
Since SSH is disabled, remote access likely happened through another method.
 Let me know what the SSH config shows!

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# NOTE: The following Include directive is not part of the default
# sshd_config shipped with OpenSSH. Options set in the included
# configuration files generally override those that follow. The defaults
# only apply to options that have not been explicitly set. Options that
# appear multiple times keep the first value set, unless they are a
# multivalue option such as HostKey or IdentityFile.
