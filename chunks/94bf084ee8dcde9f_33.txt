ð Analysis of Your SSH Configuration & Status

â 
SSH Remote Login is OFF
 â No one can currently access your Mac via SSH.

â 
No past SSH logins recorded (
last | grep "sshd"
 returned nothing).

â 
Your SSH configuration is mostly default.

ð¨ What This Means

SSH does not appear to have been actively used for remote access.

No evidence of unauthorized users or open root login (
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
 is commented out, meaning it's disabled by default).

Since SSH settings were migrated (from earlier logs), someone may have tried enabling it but then disabled it again.

ð  Next Step: Check for Other Remote Access Methods

Since 
SSH does not show direct usage
, we need to 
shift focus to other remote access methods
, such as:

1ï¸â£ 
Apple Remote Management (VNC, ARD).

2ï¸â£ 
Hidden remote access software (backdoors, malware).

â Step 1: Check for Apple Remote Desktop or VNC Activity

Since 
SSH was not used
, someone may have accessed your Mac through 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) or VNC (Screen Sharing).

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "vnc" OR eventMessage contains "remotemanagement"'

 --last 90d

ð 
What to Look For:

Any mentions of VNC or Remote Desktop activity.

Unknown devices or IP addresses that connected.
