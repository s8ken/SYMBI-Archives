â Step 2: Check If Remote Desktop Is Currently Enabled

Even if logs were cleared, we can check 
if remote access is still turned on.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"ard"

ð 
What to Look For:

If 

Remote Apple Events: On

, it means 
another Mac can control your system.

If 
any ARD (Apple Remote Desktop) services appear
, remote access may still be enabled.

ð© 
Let me know what it says!

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check for VNC or Remote Desktop logins (
log show --predicate "vnc OR remotemanagement"
).

2ï¸â£ 
See if Remote Desktop is still enabled (
systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
 & 
launchctl list | grep -i "ard"
).

ð¨ 
Since SSH was not used, the most likely attack vector is Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) or VNC.
 Run these and let me know what you find!

ð Analysis of Your Remote Management & VNC Logs

Your logs confirm 
remote management activity on February 9 and February 16, 2025
:

1ï¸â£ 
Apple Remote Management (ARD) Tasks Were Scheduled & Synced

"com.apple.remotemanagement.on-reboot"

"com.apple.remotemanagement.periodic-sync"

These indicate that 
Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop) was enabled
.

This means someone could have remotely controlled your Mac.

2ï¸â£ 

com.apple.videoconference.camera
 Process Was Running

This suggests 
your webcam was used, possibly during a remote session.

Likely used for screen sharing or video broadcasting.

3ï¸â£ 
No Direct VNC Connections Logged

No explicit 
VNC remote access attempts
 were recorded in this log.

However, 
Remote Management being active means VNC could still have been used.

ð¨ What This Means

Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop) was active, meaning someone could have accessed your Mac remotely.

Your webcam was likely in use during this time.

If VNC was used, the logs may have been cleared to hide access.

ð  Next Steps: Confirm If Remote Management Is Still Enabled

Even though we confirmed it was 
enabled in the past
, we need to 
check if it is still active now.

â Step 1: Check If Remote Management Is Enabled

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -status

ð 
What to Look For:

If it says 
"Remote Management is active"
, then someone may still have remote access to your Mac.

If it says 
"Remote Management is not active"
, then it was disabled at some point.

ð© 
Let me know what the result says!

â Step 2: Check If Remote Management Can Be Disabled

Since it was enabled before, letâs 
try disabling it manually
:

sh

Copy

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -stop

ð 
This will immediately stop any remote access.

ð© 
If it fails, let me know what message appears.

â Step 3: Check If a Hidden VNC Server Is Running

Since Remote Management was active, we need to check if a 
hidden VNC server
 is still running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screensharingd\|ARD"

ð 
What to Look For:

If 

screensharingd

 or 

ARD

 appears, it means 
a remote connection is still running.

If nothing appears, Remote Management may have been disabled.

ð© 
Let me know if any processes show up!

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if Remote Management is still active (
kickstart -status
).

2ï¸â£ 
Try disabling Remote Management (
kickstart -deactivate -stop
).

3ï¸â£ 
Check for hidden remote access services (
ps aux | grep -i "screensharingd\|ARD"
).

ð¨ 
Since Remote Management was enabled and your webcam was active, we need to confirm if remote access is still happening.
 Run these and let me know what you find!
