ð Remote Management Status Check Failed

The 

kickstart -status

 command doesnât work because 
it doesnât have a built-in status check option.

Instead, we need to use a different method to check if 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is still running.

ð  Step 1: Check If Remote Management Is Enabled

Run this in 
Terminal
 to check its current status:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"ard"

ð 
What to Look For:

If you see 
entries related to 
com.apple.ARDAgent

, it means 
Remote Management is still running.

If nothing appears, then 
ARD has been disabled.

ð© 
Let me know what you see!

ð  Step 2: Check If Screen Sharing or VNC Is Running

Since ARD and VNC are connected, letâs check if 
screen sharing is still active.

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo systemsetup -getremoteappleevents

ð 
What to Look For:

If 

Remote Login: On

 â SSH-based remote access is active.

If 

Remote Apple Events: On

 â Another Mac can send commands to your Mac.

ð© 
If these are ON, remote access is still enabled. Let me know the results!

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check if Remote Management is running (
launchctl list | grep -i "ard"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check if screen sharing or remote commands are active (
systemsetup -getremotelogin && systemsetup -getremoteappleevents
).

ð¨ 
Since ARD was previously active, we need to confirm if it's still running.
 Run these and let me know what you find!

Got it! Letâs 
fully disable both Remote Management (ARD) and the rogue OBS camera extension.

ð  Step 1: Disable Remote Management & Screen Sharing (ARD/VNC)

Since 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) and screen sharing were active
, we need to 
shut them down completely.

â Run This in Terminal to Disable ARD & VNC

sh

Copy

sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -stop
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.RemoteDesktop.agent

ð 
What This Does:

Stops and deactivates Remote Management (ARD).

Disables Appleâs built-in Screen Sharing (VNC).

Prevents Remote Desktop from running in the background.

ð  Step 2: Remove the OBS Virtual Camera Extension

Since 
OBSâs virtual camera was still installed and running
, letâs 
fully remove it.

â Step 2A: Uninstall the OBS Camera Extension

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl list

ð 
Look for an entry related to 
OBS
 or 
com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension
.

It may look something like this:

markdown

Copy

*

	FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501	com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension	(1.0)

Copy the full identifier (UUID) of the OBS extension and replace it in the next step.

â Step 2B: Unload & Remove the OBS Camera Extension

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

ð 
This will:

Uninstall the OBS virtual camera extension.

Remove all OBS-related system files.

ð© 
If you get an error, let me know, and Iâll help troubleshoot.

ð  Step 3: Restart Your Mac to Apply Changes

Since 
Remote Management, Screen Sharing, and OBS Camera were all active
, we need to 
fully restart the system
 to ensure they donât restart.

â Restart Your Mac

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð 
This will:

Ensure all remote access services are fully shut down.

Confirm that the OBS camera extension is no longer running.

Disable Remote Management & Screen Sharing (
kickstart -deactivate -stop && launchctl disable system/com.apple.screensharing
).
