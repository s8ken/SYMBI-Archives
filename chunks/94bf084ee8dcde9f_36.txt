Great! Now letâs 
fully remove the OBS Virtual Camera extension
 before you reboot.

ð  Step 1: Identify the OBS Camera Extension

Run this in 
Terminal
 to find the exact identifier:

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl list

ð 
Look for an entry related to 
OBS
 or 
com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension
.

It should look something like this:

Copy

*

	FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501	com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension	(1.0)

ð© 
Copy the full identifier (UUID) of the OBS extension and share it here if you're unsure.

ð  Step 2: Unload & Remove the OBS Camera Extension

Once you have the UUID from Step 1, replace it in the command below:

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

ð 
This will:

â 
Uninstall the OBS virtual camera extension.

â 
Remove all OBS-related system files.

ð© 
If you get an error, let me know what it says, and Iâll troubleshoot it with you.

ð  Step 3: Restart Your Mac

Since we have disabled 
Remote Management, Screen Sharing, and OBS Camera
, rebooting now will ensure that:

No background services restart.

OBS Virtual Camera is completely removed.

Remote Management does not re-enable itself.

â Restart Your Mac

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð¨ OBS Virtual Camera is Still Active!

Your system reports that 
OBS Virtual Camera is still enabled and active.

Now, weâll 
forcefully remove it
 step by step.

ð  Step 1: Disable OBS Camera in System Settings (Manual Step)

Before we uninstall it via Terminal, try 
disabling it manually
:

Go to
 â 
System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions > Camera Extensions

Look for

OBS Virtual Camera

Click Disable
 (if available)

Restart your Mac

ð  Step 2: Force Uninstall the OBS Camera Extension

If the manual method fails, weâll force-remove it using 
Terminal
.

â Run This in Terminal

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall 2MMRE5MTB8 com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension

ð 
This will:

Unload the OBS Virtual Camera extension.

Prevent it from running after a reboot.

ð© 
If an error appears, copy the message here.

ð  Step 3: Delete OBS Camera Extension Files

Once the extension is uninstalled, remove its files:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Application Support/obs-studio

ð 
This will:

â 
Delete OBS Camera system files.

â 
Ensure it cannot restart after rebooting.

ð  Step 4: Restart Your Mac

Now that weâve disabled and removed OBS Virtual Camera, restart your system to finalize changes:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now
