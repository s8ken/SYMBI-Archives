â Great! Restarting will finalize the removal of 
Remote Management, Screen Sharing, and the OBS Virtual Camera extension.

ð  After Restarting: Confirm Everything is Fully Removed

Once your Mac is back on, run the following checks:

â Check if OBS Virtual Camera is Gone

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl list

ð 
What to Look For:

OBS Virtual Camera should NOT appear in the list.

Welcome back! Letâs confirm that 
everything is fully removed.

ð  Step 1: Check If OBS Virtual Camera Is Gone

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemextensionsctl list

ð 
What to Look For:

OBS Virtual Camera should NOT appear.

If itâs still there, weâll forcefully remove any leftover files.

ð© 
Let me know what the output says!

ð  Step 2: Check If Remote Management & Screen Sharing Are Disabled

Since we removed 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) and Screen Sharing
, letâs confirm theyâre still off.

â Run These Commands in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"ard"

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"screensharing"

ð 
What to Look For:

If 
nothing appears
, that means 
Remote Management and Screen Sharing are fully disabled.

If any ARD or screen-sharing services are still running, weâll remove them manually.

ð© 
Let me know the results!

yes is there a reliable zoom client copy I can use from GitHub?

ChatGPT said:

There is 
no official, open-source Zoom client on GitHub
. Zoom does not provide its source code publicly, so any 
GitHub version claiming to be Zoom
 is either:

ð¨ 
A third-party reverse-engineered client (unofficial & risky)

ð¨ 
A potential malware-infected version

â Best Way to Get a Safe Zoom Client

If you want 
a secure Zoom version without auto-updates
, the safest option is:
