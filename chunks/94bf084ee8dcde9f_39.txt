connect to devices on your local network?"
, select:

â 
Deny
 (Do Not Allow)

Why?

Prevent unauthorized device discovery
 â Stops Zoom from scanning other devices on your network.

Blocks unnecessary data collection
 â Zoom doesn't need local network access to function properly.

Reduces attack surface
 â If an attacker exploited Zoom, they couldnât scan your network for vulnerabilities.

ð  If You Already Allowed It, Disable It

If you accidentally allowed it, disable it manually:

1ï¸â£ 
Go to macOS System Settings

2ï¸â£ 
Click "Privacy & Security" â "Local Network"

3ï¸â£ 
Find Zoom and toggle it OFF

ð© 
Let me know if Zoom still behaves strangely after this!

â Awesome! Zoom is now 
locked down for maximum security.

If you ever need to 
double-check its behavior
, run this after a meeting:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "zoom"'

 --last 1d

ð 
This will show if Zoom tried anything suspicious in the last 24 hours.

Let me know if you ever need more tweaks or security checks! ðð

ð¨ Key Findings from Zoom Logs

Your 
Zoom logs show multiple suspicious activities
 that indicate:

1ï¸â£ 
Zoomâs updater is still running persistently in the background.

2ï¸â£ 
OBS Virtual Camera was detected AFTER removal.

3ï¸â£ 
Zoom is trying to register scheduled background tasks.

4ï¸â£ 
Zoomâs updater has a "legacy agent" running hidden tasks.

ð  Immediate Actions: Disable Zoomâs Background Processes

To stop Zoom from running background tasks, run these commands:

â Step 1: Kill Active Zoom Processes

sh

Copy

sudo pkill zoom
sudo pkill ZoomOpener
sudo pkill ZoomUpdater

â 
Ensures Zoom and its updater are fully stopped.

â Step 2: Disable Zoom's Auto-Update & Background Agents

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

â 
Stops Zoomâs auto-update services from running.

â Step 3: Permanently Delete Zoomâs Background Services

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

â 
Completely removes Zoomâs hidden auto-update services.

â Step 4: Confirm Everything is Gone

Run this in 
Terminal
 to check if Zoom is still running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

ð 
If anything related to Zoom still appears, let me know.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Kill all Zoom processes (
pkill zoom
).

2ï¸â£ 
Disable and remove Zoom's auto-update services.

3ï¸â£ 
Confirm that Zoom is fully removed from background tasks.

ð¨ 
After this, reboot your Mac and check if Zoom is still running hidden processes.
 Let me know if anything looks suspicious after the reboot!

ð¨ Zoom Background Services Are Stubborn!

The error messages suggest that 
Zoom's auto-update services are deeply embedded
, and macOS is preventing them from being unloaded using 
launchctl unload
.

ð  Solution: Force Remove Using 
bootout

Since 
unload
 failed,
