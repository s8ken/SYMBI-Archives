ook for processes like:

screencapture
 (macOS built-in)

QuickTime

ffmpeg
 (used for custom recordings)

OBS
 (live-streaming software)

C. Check If macOS "screencapture" Command Was Used

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"screencapture"

 ~/.zsh_history

If attackers used the built-in screen capture tool, this will reveal it.

2ï¸â£ Find Where the Recordings Were Stored

A. Common Locations for Saved Recordings

Check these folders manually or use Terminal:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Movies/

ls

 -lt ~/Desktop/

ls

 -lt ~/Documents/

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/

ls

 -lt /private/tmp/

If attackers tried to 
hide recordings
, they might be in 
/private/tmp/
 or 
~/Library/Application Support/
.

B. Check Recent File Modifications

Run this to see files created in the past 7 days:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f -mtime -7 -

ls

 | grep -i 

".mp4\|.mov\|.avi"

If attackers saved 
screen recordings
, this will show 
when and where
.

3ï¸â£ Detect Where the Screen Recordings Were Sent

A. Check Browser History for Uploads

Open 
Safari/Chrome â History â Search "upload" or "video"

Look for 
YouStream, YouTube, Twitch, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or other file-sharing services

B. Check Terminal for Past Network Activity

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

This will show active 
internet connections
âlook for suspicious 
IP addresses or services
.

C. Scan macOS Logs for Upload Events

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 7d

This will reveal if 
files were uploaded recently
.

D. Look for Cloud Storage Uploads

Check for 
syncing activity
 in:

~/Library/Application Support/Dropbox

~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS/

~/Library/Application Support/OneDrive/

If there are logs or files with recent timestamps, they might have been 
uploaded to the cloud
.

4ï¸â£ Advanced - Monitor Live Network Traffic

If you suspect 
live broadcasting
, install 
Wireshark
 and filter for:

rtmp
 (used for streaming)

hls
 (HTTP Live Streaming)

udp
 (used for video streams)

1ï¸â£ Check OBS Studio Logs for Past Streams or Recordings

OBS keeps logs of every recording and stream.

A. Locate OBS Log Files

Run this in 
Terminal
 to find recent logs:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/

This will show recent OBS log files.

To read a log, open one with:

sh

Copy

cat

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/obs-*.txt | less

Look for 
streaming URLs or file save locations.

B. Check OBS Recording & Stream Settings

Open 
OBS Studio

Go to 
Settings â Output

Check:

Recording Path
 (Where videos were saved)

Streaming Service & Server
 (If it was broadcasting live)

Look for:

YouStream, Twitch, YouTube, RTMP URLs, or unknown servers.

C. Check OBS Profile & Scene Collection

OBS Studio â Scene Collection â Import

OBS Studio â Profile â Import

Look for 
suspicious profiles
 that may have been set up for streaming.

2ï¸â£ Find Where the Videos Were Stored

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

This will list all video files in your system.

If you suspect 
hidden storage
, check:

sh

Copy

ls

 -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/

Look for any unusual folders where files might be stored.

3ï¸â£ Check If OBS Was Live-Streaming

If OBS streamed video to a platform, check logs:

sh

Copy

cat

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/obs-*.txt | grep -i 

"rtmp\|stream"

If 
RTMP URLs
 appear, those are 
stream desti
