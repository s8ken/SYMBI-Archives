weâll 
forcefully terminate these services
 using 
bootout
:

â Step 1: Force Kill Any Running Zoom Processes

sh

Copy

sudo pkill zoom
sudo pkill ZoomOpener
sudo pkill ZoomUpdater

ð 
This ensures no Zoom processes are actively running before removal.

â Step 2: Use 
bootout
 to Force Unload Zoom Services

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

ð 
This will attempt a stronger removal method for the stuck services.

â Step 3: Delete the Zoom Auto-Updater Files

If the above commands succeed, permanently delete the Zoom updater services:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

ð 
Ensures they cannot restart after rebooting.

â Step 4: Confirm Zoom Services Are Gone

After removal, check if any Zoom services are still active:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i zoom
ps aux | grep zoom

ð 
If anything related to Zoom appears, let me know.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Force remove Zoomâs background services using 
bootout
.

2ï¸â£ 
Delete the files manually (
rm -rf ...
).

3ï¸â£ 
Check if Zoom is still running (
launchctl list | grep zoom
).

ð¨ 
If 
bootout
 fails or Zoom still appears after this, let me knowâwe may need deeper system access to fully remove it.

ð¨ Zoom Auto-Updater Is Stubborn & Wonât Unload

Since both 
unload
 and 
bootout

failed with "Input/output error"
, this suggests:

1ï¸â£ 
Zoom's updater is locked by the system or running in a protected state.

2ï¸â£ 
It may be using a hidden process or system integrity protection (SIP) to persist.

ð  Solution: Force Delete & Manually Remove Zoom Services

Since Zoomâs 
services wonât unload
, we will 
delete the files manually and force a restart.

â Step 1: Force Kill Any Running Zoom Services (Again)

Before deleting files, ensure 
no Zoom processes are running
:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill -9 zoom
sudo pkill -9 ZoomOpener
sudo pkill -9 ZoomUpdater

â Step 2: Delete Zoomâs Background Services Manually

Since we cannot unload them, letâs 
delete them directly
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

â 
This prevents Zoom from restarting itself.

â Step 3: Check If Zoom Is Still Running

Now, check if any Zoom processes remain:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

ð 
If Zoom still appears, let me know!

â Step 4: Restart Your Mac

Since Zoomâs updater is resisting removal, a 
reboot is required
 to finalize the changes:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð¨ 
After restarting, run 
launchctl list | grep zoom
 again to confirm it's fully gone.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Force delete Zoomâs update services.

2ï¸â£ 
Check if Zoom is still running (
ps aux | grep zoom
).

3ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac to ensure Zoom is fully removed.

4ï¸â£ 
After reboot, check again (
launchctl list | grep zoom
).

ð¨ 
If Zoom STILL persists after this, we may need to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) to force removal.
