Good! That force-kills any active Zoom processes.

Now, let's 
delete Zoom's auto-update services
 and confirm it's fully removed.

ð  Step 1: Delete Zoomâs Background Services Manually

Since 
bootout
 failed, delete them directly:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/us.zoom.updater.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomAutoUpdater.plist

â 
This stops Zoom from relaunching itself.

ð  Step 2: Check If Zoom Is Still Running

After deleting the files, check for any 
remaining Zoom processes
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

ð 
If Zoom still appears, let me know!

ð  Step 3: Restart Your Mac

Since Zoomâs updater is 
persistent
, a 
reboot is needed
 to finalize the removal:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð¨ 
After rebooting, check again with 
launchctl list | grep zoom
 to confirm it's fully gone.

ð© Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Delete Zoomâs update services manually.

2ï¸â£ 
Check if Zoom is still running (
ps aux | grep zoom
).

3ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac.

4ï¸â£ 
After reboot, verify Zoom is completely removed.

ð¨ 
If Zoom STILL persists after rebooting, let me knowâwe may need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) for full removal.

No problem! Just follow the remaining steps, and let me know if Zoom is fully removed after the reboot. ð

If it still persists, weâll take 
stronger measures
 to remove it completely. ð

â Confirmation: Zoom is Fully Stopped!
 ð

Your results show:

â 
No active Zoom processes running
 (
ps aux | grep zoom
 only shows the search itself).

â 
No Zoom services listed in 
launchctl
 (bootout failed, but they aren't running).

â 
Zoom auto-updater is no longer running in the background.

This means 
Zoom is no longer actively running or auto-starting.

ð  Final Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to 
completely remove any remaining Zoom files
, you can run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/zoom.us.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/zoom.us
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/us.zoom.*
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/us.zoom.*

â 
This will erase all remaining Zoom-related files.

ð© 
Let me know if Zoom stays gone after a reboot!

â Zoom is Fully Removed! ð

The error 

zsh: no matches found

 just means 
there were no leftover Zoom cache files
, which is a good sign!

â 
Zoom is no longer running.

â 
Auto-updater & background processes are gone.

â 
All Zoom-related files have been removed.

ð  Final Step: Reboot to Confirm Clean Removal

Now, restart your Mac to ensure everything is completely removed:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

After rebooting, 
run these final checks:
