Got it! Restart and check if Zoom is fully gone. Let me know when you're back! ðð

Welcome back! ðð¥ Letâs confirm that Zoom is 
fully gone
 from your system.

ð  Final Checks: Is Zoom Completely Removed?

Run these in 
Terminal
:

â Step 1: Check for Running Zoom Processes

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom

ð 
If nothing appears (except the search itself), Zoom is fully removed.

â Step 2: Check for Any Leftover Zoom Services

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i zoom

ð 
If nothing appears, Zoomâs auto-updater and background services are gone.

ð© 
Let me know what the results say!
 If Zoom still shows up, weâll nuke whateverâs left. ðð¥

â Zoom is Fully Removed! ð

Your results show 
only the search command itself
 (
grep zoom
), meaning:

â 
No Zoom processes are running.

â 
No auto-start services.

â 
No background updates.

ð 
Youâre officially Zoom-free!
 ð¥

ð  Final Optional Cleanup (Just in Case)

If you want to 
double-check and wipe any deep system remnants
, you can run:

sh

Copy

sudo find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

ð 
This will scan your entire system for any hidden Zoom files.

ð© 
If it finds anything weird, let me know! Otherwise, youâre all set.

terminal would like to access files on a network volume (which I DONT HAVE)

ChatGPT said:

ð¨ 
Suspicious Alert!
 ð¨

Your 
Mac thinks you have a network volume, but you donât.
 This could mean:

1ï¸â£ 
A hidden network drive was mounted in the past (possible attacker persistence).

2ï¸â£ 
A leftover Zoom setting or another app is still looking for remote storage.

3ï¸â£ 
macOS is mistakenly detecting a non-existent network share.

ð  Step 1: Check for Any Mounted Network Drives

Run this in 
Terminal
 to list all mounted storage:

sh

Copy

mount

ð 
Look for anything unusual, like:

Network paths (
smb://
, 
afp://
, 
nfs://
, 
ftp://
)

Mounted volumes that donât belong to you.

If anything looks weird, copy the output here.

ð  Step 2: List All Network Connections

Check if your Mac is trying to talk to a remote system:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
If unknown IPs appear, your Mac may still be connected to something.

ð© 
If you see anything unfamiliar, copy the results here.

ð  Step 3: Check for Hidden Network Volumes

Run this to list network mounts your Mac remembers:

sh

Copy

ls

 -la /Volumes

ð 
If anything unusual appears (like a ghost drive), let me know.

ð¨ 
If a hidden network volume exists, it could mean someone still has access to your system!
 Letâs figure this out ASAP. Run these and send me the results! ðð¥

You said:

so allow or no?

ChatGPT said:

â 
Do NOT Allow Terminal to Access a Network Volume!
 â

Since you 
donât have a network volume
, this request is suspicious. Allowing it 
could give an unknown process access to external storage
 that might not even be yours.

ð  Next Steps: Find Out Whatâs Causing This

Since 
Terminal is asking for network access
, let's check 
if something is trying to mount a network drive.

â Step 1: Check for Mounted Network Drives

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

mount

ð 
What to Look For:

If you see 
smb://
, 
afp://
, 
nfs://
, or any external network path, something is mounting a network share.
