If you see anything suspicious, let me know.

â Step 3: Check Network Connections

ð

If you see anything weird, copy the results here.

ð¨ What This Means

If you 
donât have a network volume
, 
something is trying to access one.

It could be a leftover Zoom setting, an old share, or a hidden process.

We need to confirm if a remote system is still connected to your Mac.

Deny It!

If 
Terminal is asking to access data from other apps
, something 
might be trying to scrape
 your personal information. 
Do NOT allow it
 until we investigate!

ð  Next Steps: Find Out Whatâs Causing This

Since Terminal is requesting unusual permissions, let's 
check what triggered it
.

â Step 1: Check Running Terminal Processes

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see whatâs active:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i terminal

ð 
What to Look For:

If 
Terminal is running anything unexpected
 in the background.

Any suspicious 
commands or scripts running inside Terminal.

ð© 
If anything weird appears, copy it here.

â Step 2: Check If a Script or Process Triggered the Request

Run this to see the 
last commands executed
:

sh

Copy

history

 | 

tail

 -20

ð 
What to Look For:

Any commands that 
mention network volumes, remote access, or hidden files.

ð© 
If anything looks off, let me know.

â Step 3: Check If Any Unknown Apps Are Requesting Access

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof | grep -i library

ð 
What to Look For:

Any unexpected apps trying to access files in 
~/Library/
 (where app data is stored).

If Zoom or any unknown process is still running.

ð© 
If something weird appears, copy the output here.

ð¨ What This Means

If 
Terminal is requesting app data
, something might be trying to 
collect or access your personal info.

It could be a rogue process, a script, or leftover Zoom permissions.

We need to confirm what triggered it before allowing anything.

ð« 
Click "Deny" and run these checks!
 Let me know what you find. ðð¥

ð¨ Key Findings from Your Zoom Cleanup Scan

Your scan results 
still show several Zoom-related files and services that need to be removed manually.

ð  Next Steps: Delete Remaining Zoom Files

Since Zoom left behind 
logs, preferences, and hidden update files
, letâs fully delete them.

â Step 1: Remove Zoom's Hidden Updater Services

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/us.zoom.ZoomDaemon
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Application\ Support/ZoomUpdater
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Preferences/us.zoom.updater.plist

â 
Deletes Zoomâs background updater and hidden service files.

â Step 2: Remove Zoom Logs & Cache

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Logs/zoom.us
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Logs/ZoomPhone
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Caches/us.zoom.xos

â 
Clears any remaining Zoom logs, which could contain stored data.

â Step 3: Remove Zoom Saved State & Config Files

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/us.zoom.xos.savedState
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Preferences/ZoomChat.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/user/Library/Group\ Containers/BJ4HAAB9B3.ZoomClient3rd

â 
Ensures Zoom cannot restore settings or reappear after a reboot.

ð  Final Step: Confirm Everything is Gone

After running the above deletions, check if anything is still left:

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

ð 
If it still finds Zoom files, let me know so we can force remove th
