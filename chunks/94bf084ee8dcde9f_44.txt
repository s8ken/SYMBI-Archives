Once this is done, restart your Mac to finalize everything:

Great! Youâve removed Zoomâs hidden updater services.

Now, letâs 
finish the cleanup
 and confirm Zoom is 
fully wiped out.

ð  Step 1: Remove Any Remaining Zoom Logs & Cache

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/zoom.us
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/ZoomPhone
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/us.zoom.xos

â 
This clears all Zoom log files and cache.

ð  Step 2: Remove Zoom Saved States & Configs

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/us.zoom.xos.savedState
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/ZoomChat.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/BJ4HAAB9B3.ZoomClient3rd

â 
Prevents Zoom from restoring any settings.

ð  Step 3: Confirm Everything is Gone

Run this in 
Terminal
 to scan for any remaining Zoom files:

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

ð 
If it still finds Zoom files, copy the results here, and weâll force remove them.

ð  Final Step: Restart Your Mac

Since Zoom had 
deep system integrations
, restart your Mac to finalize everything:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð 
After rebooting, check one last time:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

ð© 
If both return nothing, Zoom is 100% gone. Let me know how it goes!

Zoomâs logs, cache, and saved data are now fully removed!

Now, letâs 
confirm everything is gone
 and make sure 
no hidden Zoom files remain.

ð  Final Confirmation: Is Zoom Completely Removed?

Run this in 
Terminal
:

â Step 1: Check for Any Remaining Zoom Files

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*zoom*"

 2>/dev/null

ð 
If it returns nothing, Zoom is 100% gone!

ð© 
If it finds files, copy the output here, and weâll force delete them.

â Step 2: Check for Any Running Zoom Services

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep zoom
launchctl list | grep -i zoom

ð 
If nothing appears (except the search itself), Zoom is fully removed.

â Step 3: Restart to Finalize Changes

Since Zoom had 
deep system integrations
, a reboot ensures everything is cleared:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð 
After rebooting, re-run the checks above to confirm Zoom is gone!
 Let me know the results. ðð¥

ð¨ Key Findings: Some Zoom Files Are Still Left

Your scan 
mostly returned system-related "zoom" references
 (like macOS accessibility features), but I found a few 
real leftover Zoom files
 that need to be removed manually.

ð  Step 1: Remove Remaining Zoom System Files

Run these in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/receipts/us.zoom.pkg.videomeeting.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/receipts/us.zoom.pkg.videomeeting.bom
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/folders/dn/sxvkp4s5229fnrnks7223pmr0000gr/C/us.zoom.xos

â 
This deletes Zoomâs installer receipts & temp files.

ð  Step 2: Remove Zoomâs Saved State & Preferences

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/us.zoom.xos.savedState
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/ZoomChat.plist

â 
Prevents Zoom from restoring any settings.

ð  Step 3: Remove Zoom Group Containers

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Scripts/BJ4HAAB9B3.ZoomClient3rd
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/BJ4HAAB9B3.ZoomClient3rd

â 
Deletes hidden Zoom containers used for chat & meetings.

ð  Final Check: Confirm Everything is Gone

Run this one last time:

sh

Copy

find / -inam
