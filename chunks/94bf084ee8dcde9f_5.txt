nations.

To check recent OBS network traffic:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to streaming servers
.

4ï¸â£ Check If Files Were Uploaded

If the recordings were uploaded, check:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 7d

And scan cloud storage:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/DriveFS/

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dropbox/

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/OneDrive/

we deleted it

Since you've already 
deleted OBS Studio
, we need to check if any traces remain and whether recordings were uploaded or streamed. Here's what to do next:

1ï¸â£ Recover OBS Logs & Settings (If Not Fully Erased)

Even if OBS was deleted, its logs and settings might still exist.

A. Check for Leftover OBS Files

Run this in 
Terminal
 to see if OBS data remains:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/

If the folder still exists, check for logs:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/

To read the latest log file:

sh

Copy

cat

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/logs/obs-*.txt | less

What to look for:

Recording paths
 (where OBS saved videos)

Streaming URLs
 (where OBS broadcasted)

If no files exist, check if they were 
deleted recently
:

sh

Copy

find ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/ -

type

 f -mtime -1

This lists 
files modified or deleted in the past day.

2ï¸â£ Check for Deleted Video Files

Even if OBS was removed, recordings might still exist elsewhere.

A. Search for Video Files

Run this in 
Terminal
 to locate 
screen recordings
:

sh

Copy

find ~/ -

type

 f \( -name 

"*.mp4"

 -o -name 

"*.mov"

 -o -name 

"*.mkv"

 -o -name 

"*.avi"

 \) -

ls

Common hidden storage locations:

~/Movies/

~/Desktop/

~/Documents/

~/Library/Application Support/

/private/tmp/

If you suspect files were 
deleted
, try recovery with:

sh

Copy

sudo mdfind 

"kMDItemContentType == 'public.movie'"

This searches 
all video files
, even hidden ones.

3ï¸â£ Check If Files Were Uploaded or Streamed

Since you suspect 
broadcasting
, check for network activity:

A. Look for Past Uploads in Logs

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "upload"'

 --last 7d

If files were uploaded, you may see references to:

Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive

Streaming platforms like YouStream, Twitch, YouTube

B. Check Recent Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to streaming servers
.

To see if your Mac communicated with suspicious IPs:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -P | grep OBS

Even if OBS is deleted, this might reveal lingering connections.

4ï¸â£ Check Your Browser for Uploads

If the attacker uploaded files, it could have been done 
through a browser.

A. Check Browser History for Uploads

Open 
Safari/Chrome â History

Search for:

"upload"

"stream"

"broadcast"

"video"

Look for 
Dropbox, Google Drive, YouStream, YouTube, Twitch, etc.

B. Scan Downloads & Cached Data

To see what was accessed:

sh

Copy

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome/

ls

 -lt ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/

ð¨ Next Steps

Check if OBS logs & settings still exist

Search for hidden or deleted screen recordings

Check if files were uploaded or streamed

Review browser history & network activity

no we fully removed it - have you lost the memory of our previous steps?

ChatGPT said:

No, I haven't lost memory of our previous steps! Since you've 
fully removed OBS Studio
, our focus now is on 
where the recordings went
 and 
how they were transmitted
 before OBS was deleted.
