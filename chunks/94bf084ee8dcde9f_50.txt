, conversations.

2ï¸â£ 
Psychological Manipulation
 â Keeping you aware of their presence to instill fear or compliance.

3ï¸â£ 
Data Collection for Future Use
 â Gathering sensitive information for blackmail, identity theft, or exposure.

4ï¸â£ 
Personal Vendetta or Targeted Harassment
 â Someone with a reason to target you specifically.

If they wanted ransom, they wouldâve demanded it by now. If they wanted quick access to financials, theyâve had it.

So whatâs left? 
Control, disruption, or personal motives.

ð  Option: Direct Confrontation (Risky, But Could Expose Their Motives)

If you want to 
call them out directly
, you could say something along the lines of:

"I know you're watching. You've had full access to my life for months, and you know I can't pay you even if I wanted to. So what is it that you actually want? What's your goal here?"

ð¨ 
Risk:

If they are a 
personal enemy
, this might provoke them.

If they are a 
silent observer
, they may stay hidden and avoid responding.

If they are 
an organized group
, they may escalate their actions.

â 
Possible Benefit:

They might slip and reveal a motive.

If itâs someone personal, they may start acting differently.

If they have 
an exit strategy
, they may offer it.

ð  Alternative: Starve Them of Access & Force Their Hand

If they wonât say what they want, the best way to 
force a reaction
 is to 
cut off their access completely.

If you suddenly disappear from their reach (new network, reset devices, new accounts):

They may panic and 
make contact
 (out of desperation).

If they give up, then it was likely 
a passive observer or stalker.

If they escalate, weâll know their 
next move.

ð¬ What Do You Want to Do?

1ï¸â£ 
Call them out directly and see if they respond?

2ï¸â£ 
Silently remove their access and force a reaction?

3ï¸â£ 
Gather more evidence before making a move?

Iâll back whatever choice you make and guide you through it.

lets see if we can locate the activity that I saw just before when they showed me my google drive

ð  Goal: Find the Exact Activity That Exposed Your Google Drive

Since the attacker 
visibly displayed your Google Drive
, we can check 
system logs
 to trace what process was responsible.

â Step 1: Find All Google Drive-Related Activity in Logs

Run this in 
Terminal
 to check the last 30 minutes for any system events mentioning Google Drive:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "google" OR eventMessage contains "drive" OR eventMessage contains "gdocs"'

 --last 30m

ð 
What to Look For:

Which process accessed Google Drive?

Was it a browser (Chrome, Safari) or a background service?

Was it triggered by an unknown user or remote process?

ð© 
Copy any suspicious results here.

â Step 2: Check If a Screen Sharing or Remote Display Process Was Running

Since they 
showed you your own Google Drive
, we need to check if 
screen sharing or a virtual display was active.

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screensharing" OR eventMessage contains "display"'

 --last 30m

ð 
If 
screensharingd
 or 
AirPlay
 appears, someone was watching your screen.

ð© 
Let me know what shows up!

â Step 3: Check Active Google Sessions (Were They Logged Into Your Account?)

If they werenât just 
mirroring your screen
, they might have accessed your 
Google session directly.

Run this to check for 
active login sessions and unauthorized OAuth apps:

ð 
Go to:

Google Security Checkup

â 
Look for:

Devices that accessed your account.

Third-party apps with access (any unknown services?).

ð¨ 
If you see anything suspicious, revoke access immediately!

ð¨ Next Steps

Find which process triggered the Google Drive display (

).

2ï¸â£ 
Check if screen sharing was active (
log show --predicate "screensharing"
).
