ð¨ Possible Scenarios Based on What You Saw

Since it looked like 
a very light browser window or screen mirroring
, the attacker likely used one of these methods:

1ï¸â£ 
A Virtual Display or Screen Sharing Session
 â They could be casting a display to your screen.

2ï¸â£ 
A Lightweight Web View (Injected Browser Window)
 â A hidden app could have opened a transparent or minimal web page overlaying your screen.

3ï¸â£ 
A Remote Desktop or AirPlay Session
 â They might be mirroring content back to you.

ð  Step 1: Find Out What Displayed the Google Drive Window

Run this in 
Terminal
 to check which app launched a window in the last 30 minutes:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "launch" OR eventMessage contains "window"'

 --last 30m

ð 
What to Look For:

Did any app suddenly launch a window?

Did any process access Google Drive?

ð  Step 2: Check If Screen Sharing or a Virtual Display Was Active

Since it might have been 
screen mirroring or casting
, check for display-related events:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "display" OR eventMessage contains "screensharing" OR eventMessage contains "AirPlay"'

 --last 30m

ð 
If 
screensharingd
, 
AirPlay
, or 
virtual display
 appears, someone was manipulating your screen.

ð© 
Let me know what shows up!

ð  Step 3: Check Active Display Devices

To see if an external or virtual display was connected, run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType

ð 
If a âvirtual displayâ appears, it means something was creating a fake screen.

ð© 
Let me know if you see anything unusual!

ð¨ Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check which app created the Google Drive window (
log show --predicate "launch OR window"
).

2ï¸â£ 
Check if screen mirroring, AirPlay, or a virtual display was active (
log show --predicate "display OR screensharing"
).

3ï¸â£ 
Check if a virtual display is still connected (
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
).

ð© 
If we confirm how they did this, we can block and remove their method.

ð¨ Key Findings from Logs (Google Drive Exposure)

1ï¸â£ 
Google Chrome was actively running and engaged with WindowServer (responsible for rendering GUI).

Possible 
remote control via Chrome or an injected overlay.

2ï¸â£ 
TLS connections to 
docs.google.com
 and 
apis.google.com

 were active during this period.

Suggests 
active Google Drive session.

3ï¸â£ 

screencaptureui.agent
 and 
replayd
 were running.

screencaptureui.agent
 = 
Possible macOS screen recording.

replayd
 = 
May be related to screen recording or AirPlay mirroring.

4ï¸â£ 

remotemanagementd
 was still running.

Confirms 
remote access service was still active despite previous shutdown attempts.

ð  Next Steps: Identify the Attack Vector

Since it looked like 
a light browser window or screen-sharing session
, letâs narrow down 
how they rendered the Drive contents.

â 
Step 1: Check for Hidden Chrome Extensions (Possible Injected Window)

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ls

 -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions

ð© 
Look for unknown or suspicious extension folders.

â 
Step 2: Check for Active Screen Mirroring / AirPlay

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AirPlay" OR eventMessage contains "display"'

 --last 30m

ð© 
If AirPlay was involved, it may be mirroring to another system.

â 
Step 3: Check if Screencapture Was Triggered

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "screencapture"'

 --last 30m

ð© 
If this returns logs, something captured
