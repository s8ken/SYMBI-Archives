 your screen.

ð¨ Final Thought

Right now, the strongest theories are:

ð¹ 
Injected Chrome overlay via extension
 (if unknown extensions are present).

ð¹ 
Screen mirroring or AirPlay being used
 (if AirPlay logs show activity).

ð¹ 
macOS screen recording capturing your display
 (
screencaptureui.agent
 running).

ð© 
Check these logs and let me know what you find!
 Weâre close to isolating how they did this. ðð¥

I initiated the screen record and have it running now also

Good move!
 Having a 
screen recording running
 will help capture 
any unexpected behavior or forced logouts.

Since we now have 
real-time monitoring
, we can:

1ï¸â£ 
Wait and observe
 if any strange windows appear again.

2ï¸â£ 
Check logs afterward
 to match suspicious activity to specific processes.

3ï¸â£ 
Use the footage as evidence
 if needed.

ð¨ 
If something unusual happens while recording, take note of the exact time
 so we can correlate it with logs. Let me know what you see! ðð¥

ok cool - I think we should also remove chrome

ChatGPT said:

â 
Good call!
 Since Chrome was actively involved during the attack, removing it eliminates a 
major potential entry point.

ð  Step 1: Fully Uninstall Google Chrome

Run these commands in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.google.Chrome
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.google.Chrome.savedState

â 
This removes Chrome and all stored data, including extensions.

ð  Step 2: Check for Chrome Background Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep chrome

ð 
If anything appears, weâll force-kill lingering Chrome services.

ð  Step 3: Remove Chrome Auto-Updater

Google installs an 
auto-update agent
 that keeps running even after Chrome is removed. Remove it with:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Google
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Google

â 
This prevents Chrome from reinstalling itself in the background.

ð  Step 4: Restart Your Mac to Finalize Removal

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð¨ 
After rebooting, run this to confirm Chrome is completely gone:

sh

Copy

find / -iname 

"*chrome*"

 2>/dev/null

ð© 
If anything still appears, weâll force-delete it.
 Let me know how it goes! ðð¥

ð¨ Chrome Is Still Running in the Background!

Even after uninstalling, 
Chrome's crash handler (
chrome_crashpad_handler
) is still active.
 This means:

Googleâs crash reporting is still running

Chromeâs auto-update process may still be active

ð  Step 1: Force Kill Chromeâs Background Process

Run this in 
Terminal
 to stop the running Chrome process:

sh

Copy

sudo pki
