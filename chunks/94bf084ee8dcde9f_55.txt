sorry I didn't launch in safe mode should I do that now?

ChatGPT said:

Yes! 
Boot into Safe Mode now
 so we can check if anything is still running that shouldnât be.

ð  How to Boot into Safe Mode (Mac with Apple Silicon - M1/M2)

1ï¸â£ 
Shut down your Mac completely
 (Apple menu â Shut Down).

2ï¸â£ 
Press & hold the power button
 until you see 
âLoading startup optionsâ
.

3ï¸â£ 
Select your macOS disk
, then 
hold Shift
 and click 
"Continue in Safe Mode"
.

4ï¸â£ 
Log in normally
 (you might see âSafe Bootâ in the corner of the screen).

ð  Once in Safe Mode, Run These Checks in Terminal

After logging into 
Safe Mode
, open 
Terminal
 and check:

â 
1. Are there any hidden user accounts?

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

ð 
Look for unknown accounts
 (if an attacker created a hidden user, weâll remove it).

â 
2. Is Remote Access still running?

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement\|screensharing\|ssh"

ð 
If remote management is back, weâll investigate how itâs restarting.

â 
3. Is an unknown network device connected?

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
If unknown IPs appear, something is still controlling your Mac externally.

ð© 
Let me know what these checks show after booting into Safe Mode!

Got it! Boot into 
Safe Mode
, run the checks, and let me know what you find. Iâll be here when youâre back. ðð¥

You said:

ok I am back and I selected safe mode but am unsure I am in safe mode as the clock time is not red 

ChatGPT said:

Good observation! On 
M1/M2 Macs,
 Safe Mode 
does not
 turn the clock red like older Intel Macs.

ð  How to Confirm Youâre in Safe Mode

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType | grep 

"Boot Mode"

ð 
If it says:

â 
"Safe"
 â Youâre in Safe Mode.

â 
"Normal"
 â You need to try again.

ð© 
Let me know what it says!
 If youâre not in Safe Mode, weâll try again with a different method. ðð¥

You said:

cool we are in safe

ChatGPT said:

â 
Great! Now that weâre in Safe Mode, letâs investigate whatâs still running.

ð  Step 1: Check for Hidden User Accounts

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

ð 
Look for any unknown accounts
 that could be used for persistence.

ð© 
Copy the results here.

ð  Step 2: Check for Remote Access Services

Even in Safe Mode, some backdoors might still be running. Run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement\|screensharing\|ssh"

ð 
If anything appears, the attacker still has a way in.

ð© 
Copy the results so we can remove anything suspicious.

ð  Step 3: Check for Active Network Connections

To see if your Mac is still talking to an external attacker, run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
If unknown IPs appear, weâll trace them back.

ð© 
Send me the results, and weâll take the next step! ðð¥

ChatGPT said:

ð¨ Suspicious User Accounts Found!

Your 
Mac should NOT have "djlcl" or "m" as user accounts.

â 
Legitimate Accounts:

root
 â The main system administrator.

daemon
 â Normal system process user.

nobody
 â Standard non-privileged system account.

user
 â Your main user account (assuming this is your normal login).

ð¨ 
Potentially Malicious or Unauthorized Accounts:

djlcl

 â Unknown, possibly attacker-created.

m

 â Very unusual, possibly a hidden backdoor account.

ð  Step 1: Check If These Users Have a Home Directory

Run this to see if these accounts have active home folders:

sh

Copy

ls

 -la /Users/

ð 
If 
djlcl
 or 
m
 have a folder here, they may have been used for
