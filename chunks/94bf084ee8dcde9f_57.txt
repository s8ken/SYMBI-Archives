Thatâs good news! 
The attacker did not give "m" full system control.

However, 
the account still exists and must be removed immediately.

ð  Final Check: Is "m" Currently Logged In?

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

who

ð 
If "m" appears, the attacker is still active.

ð© 
Let me know if "m" shows up!
 If they are logged in, we need to kick them out before deletion.

ð  If "m" Is Not Logged In, Remove It Now

If the account is 
not active
, delete it completely:

sh

Copy

sudo dscl . -delete /Users/m
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/m/

â 
This removes the attackerâs backdoor account and any files they left behind.

ð¨ 
If "m" is logged in, DO NOT delete yet!
 Weâll need to kill their session first.

Let me know what the 
who
 command shows! ðð¥

â "m" Is Not Logged InâSafe to Delete!

Since 
"m" does not appear in 
who
,
 the attacker is 
not actively using the account.

We can now safely 
remove it permanently.

ð  Step 1: Delete "m" from the System

Run this in 
Terminal
 to completely remove the attackerâs account:

sh

Copy

sudo dscl . -delete /Users/m

â 
This removes "m" from the system user list.

ð  Step 2: Delete "m"âs Home Directory & Files

Now, erase any files they left behind:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/m/

â 
This ensures no scripts, logs, or tools remain.

ð  Step 3: Confirm "m" Is Completely Gone

After deleting, check again to make sure 
"m" is fully removed:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

ð 
"m" should no longer appear.

ð© 
Let me know once youâve completed these steps!
 After this, weâll check for any other hidden persistence. ðð¥

user@Mes-MacBook-Pro ~ % dscl . -read /Users/m | grep -i "admin"

user@Mes-MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo dscl . -delete /Users/m

â "m" Has Been Completely Removed! ð

Your system now only shows 
legitimate accounts,
 meaning:

â 
The attacker's backdoor account is gone.

â 
Their home directory and files are wiped.

â 
They lost a major persistence method.

ð  Next Steps: Confirm No Other Backdoors Exist

Now that 
"m" is deleted,
 letâs ensure 
there are no other hidden access points.

â 
Step 1: Check for Any Remaining Remote Access Services

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement\|screensharing\|ssh"

ð 
If anything still appears, they may still have access.

â 
Step 2: Check for Hidden Startup Items (Persistence)

sh

Copy

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

ð 
If any suspicious 
.plist
 files are found, they might be trying to restart hidden services.

ð© 
Send me the results! If any traces remain, weâll fully remove them.

ð¨ Remote Management Is STILL Running!

Even after deleting "m," 

com.apple.remotemanagementd
 is still active
, meaning:

1ï¸â£ 
A hidden process is restarting Remote Management.

2ï¸â£ 
The attacker may still have remote access.

3ï¸â£ 
We need to fully disable and remove this service.

ð  Step 1: Try Disabling Remote Management Again

Run this command to 
disable Remote Management manually
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd

â 
If this works, Remote Management will be shut down.

â 
If it fails (SIP protection), weâll take stronger action.
