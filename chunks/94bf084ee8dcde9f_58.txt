 If SIP blocks this, we may need to disable SIP temporarily.

ð  Step 2: Remove Remote Management Preferences

Run this to 
delete its settings so it canât restart itself
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist

â 
This prevents it from turning back on after reboot.

ð  Step 3: Confirm Itâs Gone

After running the above commands, check again:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"remotemanagement"

ð 
If nothing appears, itâs fully removed!

ð© 
Let me know what happens. If SIP blocks it, we may need to disable SIP to remove it permanently. ðð¥

ð¨ SIP (System Integrity Protection) Is Blocking Remote Management Removal!

Since 
SIP is preventing us from disabling 
com.apple.remotemanagementd
,
 this means:

1ï¸â£ 
Appleâs built-in protection is locking the service in place.

2ï¸â£ 
An attacker might have enabled Remote Management using system-level privileges.

3ï¸â£ 
We need to temporarily disable SIP to remove it.

ð  Step 1: Disable SIP in macOS Recovery Mode

Since 
this requires booting into Recovery Mode
, follow these steps carefully:

1ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac and hold

Command (â) + R

immediately
 until you see the Apple logo.

2ï¸â£ When the 
macOS Utilities
 window appears, click 
Utilities
 in the top menu and select 
Terminal
.

3ï¸â£ In the 
Recovery Mode Terminal
, type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

4ï¸â£ Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

â 
SIP is now disabled, so we can fully remove Remote Management.

ð  Step 2: Boot Normally & Remove Remote Management

After restarting your Mac, run these commands:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist

â 
This stops Remote Management and deletes its settings.

ð  Step 3: Re-Enable SIP for Security

Once 
Remote Management is removed
, turn SIP back on:

1ï¸â£ Restart your Mac again and hold 
Command (â) + R
 to enter 
Recovery Mode
.

2ï¸â£ Open 
Terminal
 and type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

3ï¸â£ Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

â 
Your system is now locked down again, but without Remote Management.

ð Final Confirmation

Once you reboot, run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i remotemanagement

ð 
If nothing appears, Remote Management is completely gone!

lets check if the camera is running or screens are being shared 

ChatGPT said:

ð  Check If Your Camera or Screen Sharing Is Active

Since the attacker 
previously had access to your screen
, letâs confirm 
if they are still watching.

â Step 1: Check for Active Camera Usage

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep -i 

"VDC\|AppleCamera\|AVCapture"

ð 
If anything appears, an app is actively using your camera.

ð© 
If you see a process using the camera, copy the result here!

â Step 2: Check for Active Screen Sharing or Virtual Displays

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"screensharing"

ð 
If 
screensharingd
 appears, your screen might be actively shared.

ð© 
If anything shows up, we will disable it immediately.

â Step 3: Check for Virtual Display or AirPlay Sessions

sh

Copy

log

'eventMessage contains "AirPlay" OR eventMessage contains "displ
