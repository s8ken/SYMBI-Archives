Since 

lsof
 returned nothing
, your camera is 
not currently in use
 by any app.

Now, letâs check if 
screen sharing or virtual displays are still active.

ð  Step 2: Check for Active Screen Sharing Services

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep -i 

"screensharing"

ð 
If 
screensharingd
 appears, something is still running screen sharing.

ð© 
Send me the results!
 If itâs active, weâll shut it down.

ð  Step 3: Check for Virtual Display or AirPlay Sessions

Since 
they previously showed you your own Google Drive
, they may still be using AirPlay or virtual displays.

Run this:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AirPlay" OR eventMessage contains "display" OR eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 30m

ð 
If anything appears, screen sharing or AirPlay may still be running.

ð© 
Let me know what shows up!
 If we find activity, we will disable it immediately. ðð¥

â No Active Screen Sharing Services Detected! ð

Since 

sudo launchctl list | grep -i "screensharing"
 returned nothing,
 it means:

â 
Screen Sharing (
screensharingd
) is not running.

â 
No active remote desktop session is detected.

â 
Your screen is not currently being shared via macOS services.

Now, letâs 
double-check for AirPlay or virtual displays
 to be 100% sure.

ð  Final Check: Look for AirPlay & Virtual Display Activity

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AirPlay" OR eventMessage contains "display" OR eventMessage contains "screensharing"'

 --last 30m

ð 
If nothing appears, then your screen has not been shared recently.

Send me the results!
 If anything shows up, weâll investigate further. ðð¥

hi I want to revisit the case study and make some amendments 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Let's pull up the case study and make the necessary changes. What specific amendments do you want to make? ðâï¸

You said:

I think we need to reference the evidence that we found ie in the terminal logs when we say things like 'Unremovable virtual camera drivers (OBS Virtual Camera remained active post-removal).'

ChatGPT said:

That makes sense! We need to ensure that every claim in the case study is backed up with 
specific evidence from terminal logs
 or other data you collected.

ð  Suggested Approach for Amendments

1ï¸â£ 
Reference Terminal Logs
 â When we mention findings (e.g., 
OBS Virtual Camera persistence, unauthorized user "m"
), we should include the exact 
log output
 that proved it.

2ï¸â£ 
Organize Evidence Chronologically
 â Make it clear 
when and how
 each discovery was made.

3ï¸â£ 
Strengthen Claims
 â Example: Instead of just saying 
"OBS Virtual Camera persisted post-removal,"
 we can add:

"Despite removing OBS Studio via 
sudo rm -rf /Applications/OBS.app
, the system still listed 
com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension
 as active (
systemextensionsctl list
 output attached below)."

ð  Next Steps

Do you want me to pull up the existing case study so we can edit it directly?

Or do you want to list out all the key pieces of evidence first and then integrate them?

Let me know how youâd like to proceed! ðð

yes please wherever possible - if its not available ie its reported by me on an android device which we didn't test at the time we can say as reported by user and awaiting further verification
