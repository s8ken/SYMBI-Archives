singly isolated and unsupported in evidencing and resolving the problem.

Additionally, the user became aware that their 

screen and cameras were recording without consent

 based on 

unexpected reactions from people during online meetings and on platforms where no video, audio, or system recording was expected.

 This further reinforced concerns that unauthorized surveillance was occurring.

As a result of the prolonged attack, the user experienced 

severe financial hardship, mental health consequences, and the loss of their job.

 The ongoing and highly targeted nature of the breach led to 

significant distress, feelings of ostracization, and the need to seek medical treatment.

2. Key Evidence & Verification

2.1 Unauthorized User Accounts

Discovery:

 Terminal logs confirmed an unauthorized user account named 

âmâ

, while the legitimate user accounts were 

daemon, djlcl, me, nobody, root, and user.

Log Evidence:

dscl . list /Users | grep -v '^_'

Result:

daemon

djlcl

m  # Unauthorized account

me

nobody

root

user

Resolution:

 The user manually removed the 

âmâ

 account and its home directory.

sudo dscl . -delete /Users/m

sudo rm -rf /Users/m/

2.2 Remote Management & Screen Sharing Persistence

Discovery:

 Even after multiple removal attempts, 

com.apple.remotemanagementd

 remained active, indicating forced persistence.

Log Evidence:

sudo launchctl list | grep -i "remotemanagement"

Result:

776	0	com.apple.remotemanagementd

Removal Attempt & SIP Blockage:

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd

Result:

Boot-out failed: 150: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged

Status:

 Pending SIP disabling and manual removal in Recovery Mode.

2.3 Unremovable Virtual Camera Drivers (OBS Virtual Camera Persistence)

Discovery:

 Despite fully removing OBS Studio, its 

camera system extension remained active.

Log Evidence:

sudo systemextensionsctl list

Result:

*  *  2MMRE5MTB8  com.obsproject.obs-studio.mac-camera-extension (31.0.1/12846547662) OBS Virtual Camera [activated enabled]

Status:

 Successfully removed via system settings and restart.

2.4 Persistent Programs & Extensions

Discovery:

 Several programs and extensions remained active 

despite removal attempts

, indicating deep persistence mechanisms.

Identified Persistent Components:

Google Chrome Crash Handler (

chrome_crashpad_handler

)

 â Continued running after full Chrome removal.

OBS Virtual Camera Extension

 â Persisted in 

systemextensionsctl list

.

Remote Management Service (

com.apple.remotemanagementd

)

 â Could not be removed due to SIP.

Potential Hidden WebView or Embedded Browser

 â Used to display Google Drive without user interaction.

Undetected Persistence Mechanisms

 â Further investigation needed into possible launch agents, daemons, or firmware-level persistence.

Status:

 Ongoing efforts to identify and remove all persistent software.

2.5 Forced Logout & Google Drive Exposure Event

Discovery:

 At 

00:55:20 - 00:57:07

, the user was 

forcibly logged out

 of their session, followed by an unexpected display of 

Google Drive contents

 in a lightweight browser-like window at 

00:59:06

.

Log Evidence:

log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "logout" OR eventMessage contains "disconnected"' --last 60m

Result:

System logout event detected at 00:55:20

Network session disruption at 00:57:07

log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "google" OR eventMessage contains "drive"' --last 60m

Result:

TLS connections to docs.google.com and apis.google.com detected

Chrome actively communicating with Google services at 00:59:06

Status:

 Investigation ongoing into the method used to forcibly display Google Drive, including potential WebView injection or lightweight browser manipulation.
