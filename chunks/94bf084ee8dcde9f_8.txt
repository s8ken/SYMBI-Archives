Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 7d

If you see 
DNS requests for Twitch, YouTube Live, YouStream, etc.,
 it confirms livestreaming was happening.

ð· 4ï¸â£ Check If Your Camera/Microphone Were Used

Since many livestreams include 
audio/video
, check if the camera/microphone were accessed.

A. Check for Webcam & Mic Usage

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 7d

If results show 
FaceTime Camera
 or 
Microphone Activation
, it means audio/video were being captured.

B. Look for Streaming-Related Permissions

Go to:

System Settings â Privacy & Security â Camera

System Settings â Privacy & Security â Microphone

System Settings â Privacy & Security â Screen Recording

If 
any unknown apps
 have permission, revoke access.

ð¨ Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Run 
log show
 commands for RTMP & WebRTC activity.

2ï¸â£ 
Check 
netstat
 and DNS queries for outbound livestreams.

3ï¸â£ 
Look at past browser history for YouStream/Twitch activity.

4ï¸â£ 
Check if camera/mic were activated for live broadcasts.

Since your 
RTMP log search returned nothing
, that suggests:

Livestreaming might have used a different protocol (like WebRTC instead of RTMP).

The logs may have been cleared or overwritten before you ran the search.

A VPN, proxy, or hidden process might have obscured the streaming activity.

ð¨ Next Steps: Alternative Ways to Detect Livestreaming

Since RTMP logs didnât show anything, letâs expand our search.

1ï¸â£ Check for WebRTC-Based Livestreams

Many web-based streaming platforms (YouTube Live, Twitch Studio, Facebook Live) use 
WebRTC instead of RTMP
.

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'

 --last 7d

If WebRTC was used, you might see connections to 
streaming platforms
.

2ï¸â£ Scan for Active or Recent Network Connections

Livestreams require 
constant internet connections
. Checking past network activity could reveal where data was sent.

A. Find Recent Outbound Streaming Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to streaming servers
 (Twitch, YouStream, YouTube, Facebook Live, unknown IPs).

B. Check DNS Requests for Streaming Services

If your Mac resolved DNS requests for streaming services, youâll see them here:

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 7d

Look for domain names like:

youtube.com

twitch.tv

youstream.com

facebook.com/live

Any unknown domains

3ï¸â£ Check If Livestreaming Was Done Through a Browser

If a web-based streaming platform was used, 
browser history or cached data
 might reveal it.

A. Search for "Live" or "Stream" in Browser History

For Chrome:

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"livestream\|stream"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History

For Safari:

sh

Copy

sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

Look for 
YouStream, YouTube Live, Twitch, or Facebook Live URLs
.

B. Check WebRTC & Streaming Permissions in Browser

Open 
Chrome
 â Go to 
chrome://settings/content/camera

Open 
Safari
 â Go to 
Settings â Websites â Camera & Microphone

If any 
streaming platform
 was granted camera/microphone permissions, it might confirm 
livestreaming.

4ï¸â£ Check for Video Capture or Audio Streaming

Even if livestreaming logs are missing, your system may still log 
video/audio activity.

A. Search for AVCapture (Camera/Microphone Use)

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'

 --last 7d

If you see 
FaceTime
