 Camera
 or 
Microphone activation
, it suggests audio/video were broadcasted.

B. Look for Active Screen Recording Apps

Check 
System Settings â Privacy & Security â Screen Recording

See if 
any unknown apps
 have permission.

To list running screen recording processes, run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i 

"screencapture"

If 
screencapture, OBS, or ffmpeg
 appears, it may have been used for streaming.

5ï¸â£ (Advanced) Check Outbound Data Transfer

If streaming logs were deleted, we can still check for 
unusual outbound data transfer.

A. List Recent Large Data Transfers

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

This shows 
which apps sent large amounts of data
 over the network.

B. Monitor Live Network Traffic

To catch 
active network traffic
, install 
Wireshark
 or run:

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0

Look for 
large, sustained outbound traffic
âthis could be a 
livestream.

ð¨ Summary of Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Check WebRTC logs (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "webrtc"'
)

2ï¸â£ 
Look for active network connections (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
)

3ï¸â£ 
Search browser history for livestream platforms

4ï¸â£ 
Check if camera/mic were used (
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "AVCapture"'
)

5ï¸â£ 
List recent large data transfers (
nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep "upload"
)

Since 
RTMP logs came up empty
, this suggests either 
WebRTC livestreaming
 or a 
hidden network connection
. Let me know what results you get! ð¨

Since 
both RTMP and WebRTC logs show nothing
, the livestreaming could have been:

Obfuscated (logs cleared, VPN/proxy used)

Done through another method (custom protocol, hidden process)

Broadcasted through browser-based streaming that didnât leave direct logs

ð¨ Next Steps to Uncover Hidden Livestreaming

Weâll now check 
network connections, browser activity, and system processes
 to catch whatâs missing.

1ï¸â£ Find Active or Past Network Connections (Where Was Data Sent?)

Livestreaming requires 
constant outbound data transfer
, so we need to check which services your Mac was communicating with.

A. List All Current Network Connections

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Look for 
connections to unknown servers, large data transfers, or streaming services.

B. Check for Past Connections

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "DNS"'

 --last 7d

If any 
streaming site (YouTube Live, Twitch, YouStream, Facebook Live)
 appears, thatâs a clue.

C. Check for Suspicious High-Bandwidth Processes

sh

Copy

sudo nettop -m tcp -p -P | grep -E 

"upload|send"

This lists 
apps sending large amounts of data
âa possible livestream.

2ï¸â£ Look for Browser-Based Streaming (Livestream Pages Opened)

If the livestream happened through 
YouTube, Twitch, YouStream, or another web service
, it may still be in the browser logs.

A. Search Browser History for "Stream" or "Live"

For Chrome:

sh

Copy

grep -i 

"stream\|live"

 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History

For Safari:

sh

Copy

sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url FROM history_items WHERE url LIKE '%stream%';"

Look for URLs related to 
YouTube Live, Twitch, Facebook Live, YouStream, or unknown streaming sites.

B. Check for Camera/Microphone Permissions in the Browser

Chrome:
 Open 
chrome://settings/content/camera

Safari:
 Open 
Settings â Websites â Camera & Microphone

See if streaming services were granted permission.

3ï¸â£ Find Evidence of Screen Recording or Camera Access

Even if the livestream logs are missing, 
camera/microphone access
 may still be logged.

A. Check for Webcam & Mic Use

sh

Copy

sudo 

log

 show --predicat
