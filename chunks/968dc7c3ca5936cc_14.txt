ONE STEP AT A TIME ONE STEP AT A TIME! why am I repeating this

Got it! Iâll take it 
one step at a time
 and wait for you to respond before moving forward.

Step 4.1: Fix the Command You Ran

It looks like the command 
was incomplete
 or cut off. Letâs run it again properly:

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i airplay

This will check if 
any hidden launch agents
 related to AirPlay exist.

Let me know what the output is
 before we move forward! ð¨

lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % ls -la /Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i airplay

ChatGPT said:

Goodâthere are 
no AirPlay-related Launch Agents
 at the user level.

Step 4.2: Check for System-Level AirPlay Daemons

Now, letâs check if 
system services
 are forcing AirPlay back on.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i airplay

This will check if 
any system daemons
 are automatically restarting AirPlay.

Let me know what the output is before we move forward!

You said:

isn't that the same as the last one we ran?

ChatGPT said:

Good question! The difference is:

LaunchAgents
 (what we just checked) run for individual users when they log in.

LaunchDaemons
 (what we're checking now) run at the 
system level
, even before a user logs in.

Since 
AirPlay is still running despite being turned off
, it's possible that a 
LaunchDaemon
 is keeping it alive.

Step 4.2: Check for System Daemons Keeping AirPlay Active

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i airplay

This will check if 
a system service is forcing AirPlay to restart
.

Let me know the output before we move to the next step!

ChatGPT said:

Goodâsince 
no LaunchDaemons related to AirPlay
 were found, that means there isnât an obvious system service forcing it to restart.

Step 4.3: Check for User-Specific Launch Agents

Now, let's check if 
your user account
 has anything AirPlay-related running in its 
personal launch directory.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i airplay

This will check if anything in 
your user account
 is forcing AirPlay to stay on.

Let me know the output before we continue!

how are they different they all look the same? lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % ls -la /Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i airplay

lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % ls -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i airplay

lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % ls -la /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i airplay

lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i airplay

Great question! Hereâs the difference between the three locations we checked:

/Library/LaunchAgents

 â Runs 
only when a user logs in
. Affects all users on the system.

/Library/LaunchDaemons

 â Runs at the 
system level
, even before anyone logs in.

~/Library/LaunchAgents

 â Runs 
only for your specific user account
 after login.

Since 
none of these locations have AirPlay-related files
, that means 
there isnât a visible launch service forcing AirPlay back on.
