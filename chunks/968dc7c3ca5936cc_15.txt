rences (Hidden System Settings)

Since 
AirPlayXPCHelper is still running despite being disabled
, letâs check if there are 
hidden system preferences
 keeping it active.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 com.apple.airplay

If it returns 
any settings
, it means something is keeping AirPlay alive at the system level.

Goodâsince 

com.apple.airplay
 does not exist
, that means 
AirPlay is not being controlled by user-level preferences.

Yet, 
AirPlayXPCHelper is still running
, meaning something deeper is forcing it to stay active.

Step 6: Check for Active AirPlay Processes

Since nothing in settings, launch services, or user preferences is forcing AirPlay to run, letâs find out 
which processes are keeping it alive.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

This will list 
all running processes related to AirPlay
 and show if another system service is keeping it active.

Let me know what the output is before we move forward! ð¨

Findings: AirPlay Processes Are Still Running

Your output confirms that 
two AirPlay-related processes are running:

AirPlayUIAgent

 (
/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app
)

This handles the 
AirPlay UI elements
 and is responsible for the 
purple icon in the menu bar
.

AirPlayXPCHelper

 (
/usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
)

This is a 
core system process
 that manages 
AirPlay connections
.

This should 
not be running
 if AirPlay is fully disabled.

Since 
AirPlay is turned off in settings
, but these processes 
keep coming back
, something is 
forcing them to stay active.

Step 7: Check If AirPlay is Being Restarted by a System Service

Letâs check if 
macOS is automatically restarting AirPlay
 through a system service.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl list | grep -i airplay

This will show if 
a launch service is actively managing AirPlay
 and restarting it.

Let me know what it returns before we continue!

Findings: AirPlayUIAgent is Actively Running via 
launchctl

Your output confirms that 

com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent
 is being managed by launch services
, which means 
macOS is actively keeping it running.

Since AirPlay is turned off in settings, 
this should not be happening.

Step 8: Force Disable AirPlayUIAgent

Since 
AirPlayUIAgent
 is being restarted by 
launchctl
, let's 
disable it manually.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl 

disable

 gui/$(

id

 -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

This will 
stop AirPlayUIAgent from running under your user account.

After running that, check if 
the purple AirPlay icon disappears
 from the menu bar.

Let me know what happens before we continue!

Good! Since the command ran without errors, 
AirPlayUIAgent

should now be disabled
.

Step 9: Check If the AirPlay Icon Disappeared
