 your screen).

Is the purple AirPlay icon gone?

If 
itâs still there
, the process might still be running.

Step 10: Kill the Running AirPlay Processes

Now, let's 
force stop any remaining AirPlay processes
:

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent AirPlayXPCHelper

This will 
immediately stop
 both processes.

Let me know if the AirPlay icon disappears after this!

AirPlay is Still Running â Something is Persisting It

Since we 
disabled

AirPlayUIAgent
, 
killed the processes
, and 
itâs still running
, something 
deep in the system is forcing it back on.

We need to 
trace whatâs reactivating AirPlay
 at the system level.

Step 11: Check If AirPlay is Running as a Root System Process

Since 
launchctl disable
 didnât stop it, letâs check if 
macOS is restarting it as a system service.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i airplay

This will tell us if 
macOS is running AirPlay as a protected system service, which we need to disable differently.

Let me know the output before we move forward!

Findings: AirPlayXPCHelper is Running as a Root System Process

Your output confirms that 

com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
 is running at the system level (
sudo launchctl list
)
, which means 
macOS is restarting it as a protected system service
.

Since 
disabling the user-level service didnât work
, we now need to 
disable it at the system level.

ð¨ Step 12: Disable AirPlayXPCHelper at the System Level

Since 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 is running under root privileges, we need to 
disable it system-wide
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

ð¹ 
This prevents macOS from restarting AirPlayXPCHelper.

After running this, 
reboot your Mac
 and check if:

The 
purple AirPlay icon is gone
.

AirPlayXPCHelper

stays disabled
 after restart.

Check If AirPlay is Still Running After Reboot

Once your Mac reboots, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

If 
nothing appears
, AirPlay is finally disabled. If it 
still runs
, weâll have to investigate deeper persistence methods.

Let me know 
if AirPlay stays disabled after the reboot!

AirPlay is Still Running â We Need to Dig Deeper

Since we've disabled 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 at the system level and it's still 
persisting
, something is 
forcing it to restart against system settings.

This suggests 
either:

A hidden system process is keeping it alive

A network-based trigger is reactivating it

Persistence from malware or unauthorized access

ð¨ Step 13: Check If Another Process is Restarting AirPlay

Letâs check what 
other services are linked to AirPlay
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -iUDP | grep -i airplay

ð¹ This will list 
any network connections related to AirPlay
, showing if something 
on your network is triggering AirPlay.

ð¨ Step 14: Check System-Wide Launch Services

Since AirPlay is being 
forced on
, we need to check 
all system services
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i apple

ð¹ This will show 
all protected system services
, helping us see if 
AirPlay is being controlled by another system daemon.

What Weâre Looking For

If 
AirPlay appears in 
lsof -iUDP

, it means a 
network trigger
 is keeping it alive.

If 
another system process is forcing it back on (
launchctl list
)
, we 
disable that next
.

Next Steps

Run both commands

Let me know the 
outputs

We 
disable whatever is forcing AirPlay on

ð¨ 
If we find a hidden system daemon, weâll disable it next.
