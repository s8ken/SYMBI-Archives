Findings: AirPlayXPCHelper is Running as a System Daemon

Your output confirms that 
AirPlayXPCHelper is running as a system service under 
launchctl

 (
com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
). This explains why 
it keeps coming back even after we've disabled it at the user level
.

Now, we need to 
force disable it at the system level permanently.

ð¨ Step 15: Disable AirPlayXPCHelper at the System Level

Since itâs running as a 
protected system daemon
, letâs 
prevent macOS from launching it again.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

ð¹ 
This will fully unload the AirPlayXPCHelper service from the system.

ð¹ 
If successful, this should remove the purple icon immediately.

After running this, 
check if the AirPlay icon disappears from the menu bar.

ð¨ Step 16: Verify AirPlay is Gone

Once youâve run that command, verify that AirPlay is no longer running by checking system processes:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears
, AirPlay is finally disabled.

ð¨ 
If AirPlayXPCHelper still appears, something is forcing it back, and weâll need to take further steps.

Next Steps

Run 

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

Check if the AirPlay icon disappears

Run 
ps aux | grep -i airplay

 to confirm AirPlay is gone

Let me know the results before we move forward! ð¨

I'm right here! Since 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing us from disabling AirPlayXPCHelper
, we need to approach this differently.

ð¨ Step 17: Understanding SIP (System Integrity Protection)

SIP is a 
macOS security feature
 that prevents critical system services from being modified, even by an admin. Thatâs why we got:

"Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged"

This means 
AirPlayXPCHelper is protected by SIP
, and macOS is 
forcing it to stay enabled
.

â¡ Next Steps: Two Possible Solutions

Now, we have 
two options
 depending on how far you want to go:

 Disable AirPlay Another Way

Instead of disabling the daemon, we can block its functionality using system permissions
