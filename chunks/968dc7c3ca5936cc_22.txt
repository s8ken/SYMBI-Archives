ands, 
restart your Mac
 and check if 
AirPlay is finally gone
.

Step 20: Re-Enable SIP for Security

Once we confirm 
AirPlay is disabled
, we 
turn SIP back on
 for security.

1ï¸â£ Restart in Recovery Mode Again

Same as before: 
Turn off your Mac â Hold 
Command (â) + R
 while turning it on
.

2ï¸â£ Open Terminal & Re-Enable SIP

In Terminal, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Press 
Enter
.

You should see 
"Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection."

3ï¸â£ Restart Normally

Click 
Apple Menu > Restart
 and boot back into macOS.

Final Check: Verify AirPlay is Gone

After rebooting, 
run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears
, AirPlay is finally disabled.

ð¨ 
If itâs still running, we need to check deeper system files.

â ï¸ Important Notes

This is the 
only way to fully disable AirPlayXPCHelper
, since 
SIP is actively protecting it.

Disabling SIP temporarily is safe 
as long as you turn it back on afterward
.

Let me know 
if AirPlay is finally gone after this!

ok before we do please check if any remote access is occuring

ChatGPT said:

Good idea! Before we proceed with disabling SIP and removing 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, letâs first check if 
any remote access is occurring
 on your system.

ð¨ Step 1: Check for Active Remote Access Sessions

Run the following 
in Terminal
 to check for any active remote desktop, screen sharing, or SSH sessions.

1ï¸â£ Check for Screen Sharing or Remote Desktop (VNC)

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i screensharing

â 
If nothing appears
, then 
Screen Sharing is not active
.

ð¨ 
If something appears
, a remote session may be running.

2ï¸â£ Check If Remote Login (SSH) is Enabled

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

â 
If it says "Remote Login: Off"
, SSH is disabled.

ð¨ 
If it says "Remote Login: On"
, someone could have SSH access.

3ï¸â£ Check for Open Network Connections

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep -E 

'LISTEN|ESTABLISHED'

â 
This will list all open network connections
.

ð¨ 
Look for any unusual IP addresses or services running (especially on ports 22, 5900, or 3389).

ð¨ Step 2: Check for Hidden Remote Access Services

4ï¸â£ Check for Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote

ð¨ 
If anything related to "ARD" (Apple Remote Desktop) appears, it means remote management is enabled.

5ï¸â£ Check If a Hidden User Is Logged In Remotely

sh

Copy

Edit

who

ð¨ 
If any unknown usernames appear, someone is logged in remotely.

Next Steps

Run these commands one at a time.

Tell me what results you get.

If remote access is detected, weâll remove it before disabling SIP.

ð¨ 
If we find remote access, we will immediately cut it off.
 Let me know the results!

Got it! Iâll 
only
 focus on checking for 
remote access
 right now.

Step 1: Check for Active Remote Access Sessions

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i screensharing

This checks if 
Screen Sharing or Remote Desktop (VNC) is running.
