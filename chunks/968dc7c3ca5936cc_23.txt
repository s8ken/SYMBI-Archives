Findings: Remote Screen Sharing Process is Running

The output shows that 

ScreenSharingSubscriber.xpc
 is running
, which suggests that 
a remote screen sharing process is active or recently attempted
.

What This Means:

ScreenSharingSubscriber.xpc

 is part of 
Apple Remote Management and Screen Sharing services
.

This could mean 
your system is set to allow screen sharing
, or 
someone attempted to access it remotely
.

ð¨ Step 2: Check If Screen Sharing is Enabled

Now, letâs check if 
Screen Sharing is currently allowed
 on your Mac.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

â 
If it says "Remote Login: Off"
, remote access via SSH is disabled.

ð¨ 
If it says "Remote Login: On"
, SSH is enabled and could be a risk.

ð¨ Step 3: Check for Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote

â 
If nothing appears
, remote management is not actively running.

ð¨ 
If something appears
, it means 
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) or another remote access service is enabled.

Next Steps:

Run 
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

 and tell me the output.

Run 
sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote

 and tell me if anything appears.

ð¨ 
If we confirm remote access is active, weâll immediately disable it.
 Let me know the results before we move forward!

Findings: Remote Access Services Are Present but Not Fully Active

From your output, we can see:

Screen Sharing Process is Running (
ScreenSharingSubscriber.xpc
)

Even though 
Remote Login (SSH) is OFF
, this process suggests that 
screen sharing or remote management was used or attempted.

Multiple Remote Services Are Listed Under 
launchctl

com.apple.remotemanagementd

 â This is Apple's 
Remote Management service (ARD)
, used for remote desktop control.

com.apple.remoted

 â This is a 
background service for remote events and media control
 (used by AirPlay, Siri, and external device control).

com.apple.RemotePairTool

 â Used for 
pairing Apple devices remotely
 (e.g., Sidecar, Universal Control).

com.apple.RemoteDesktop.PrivilegeProxy

 â Can be used by 
Apple Remote Desktop for privileged operations.

ð¨ Step 4: Check If Remote Management is Enabled in macOS Settings

Before disabling anything, let's confirm if 
Remote Management is actually enabled.

1ï¸â£ Go to System Settings:

Click 
System Settings

Go to 
General > Sharing

Check if 
Remote Management
 is ON or OFF.

ð¨ 
If 
Remote Management
 is ON, turn it OFF.

ð¨ Step 5: Force Disable Remote Management Services

If Remote Management was ON (or if we want to prevent it from running at all), we can 
force disable it manually.

Run This in Terminal to Stop Remote Management:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd

ð¹ 
This removes the Remote Management daemon from the system
 unt
