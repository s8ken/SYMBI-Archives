il the next reboot.

Then, Remove Any Remote Management Configuration Files:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Application\ Support/Apple/RemoteDesktop/
sudo 

rm

 -rf /var/db/RemoteManagement/

ð¹ This deletes 
any stored remote access settings
, preventing it from being re-enabled automatically.

Next Steps

Check 
System Settings > General > Sharing

 and confirm if 
Remote Management is ON or OFF.

Run 
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd

 and confirm if the process is stopped.

If necessary, remove stored Remote Management settings using 
rm -rf
 commands.

ð¨ 
If any of these services restart after disabling them, we may be dealing with persistence from malware or unauthorized access.

Let me know 
if Remote Management was ON
 and whether 
disabling it removed the process!

Findings: All Remote Access Services Are Off

Since 
everything is off

Findings: System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Blocking Remote Management Removal

Since you got:

"Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged"

That means 
SIP is preventing us from fully disabling Remote Management
. Even though 
Remote Management is OFF in settings
, the 
process (
com.apple.remotemanagementd
) is still present
 and could be restarted by macOS.

ð¨ Next Step: Verify If Remote Management is Still Running

Before taking further action, letâs check if any 
Remote Management processes are still active
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i remote

â 
If nothing appears
, Remote Management is 
not running
, even if the service is still listed.

ð¨ 
If 
remotemanagementd
 or other remote services are running, something is keeping it alive.

Next Step: Disable SIP Temporarily (If Necessary)

If the process 
is still running
, the only way to fully disable it is to 
temporarily disable SIP
, just like with AirPlay.

Let me know the output of 
ps aux | grep -i remote
, and then weâll decide whether we need to go into 
Recovery Mode
 to disable SIP. ð¨
