Findings: Remote Management Processes Are Still Running Despite Being Disabled

Your output confirms that 
multiple Remote Management services are still active
, even though you have disabled them in System Settings.

ð¨ What This Means

Remote Management (
remotemanagementd
) is running despite being turned off in settings.

Screen Sharing Subscriber (
ScreenSharingSubscriber.xpc
) is still active.

Other remote management services (like 
remoted
, 
mediaremoted
, and 
LegacyProfilesSubscriber.xpc
) are running.

System Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing these from being fully disabled.

This strongly suggests 
macOS is forcing these services to stay enabled
, meaning 
SIP is blocking their removal
.

ð¨ Next Step: Verify If Any Remote Configuration Profiles Exist

Sometimes, 
remote management settings are enforced via Configuration Profiles
, which can 
override user preferences
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo profiles list

â 
If nothing appears
, no remote profiles are enforcing these settings.

ð¨ 
If something appears
, a profile is controlling system settings.

ð¨ Next Step: Check for Unauthorized Remote Users

Letâs see if any unauthorized users 
are connected remotely.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

who

ð¨ 
If unknown users appear
, someone has accessed your system remotely.

Next Steps

Run 
sudo profiles list

 to check if a remote profile is enforcing these settings.

Run 
who

 to check if anyone is remotely connected.

Let me know the results
 before we take further action! ð¨

Findings: No Configuration Profiles Are Forcing Remote Management

Since 

sudo profiles list
 returned no profiles
, that means 
nothing is enforcing remote management through a system profile.

Now, let's 
check if anyone is connected remotely
 before we proceed further.
