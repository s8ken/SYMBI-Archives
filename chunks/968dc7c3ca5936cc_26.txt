Findings: No Remote Users Are Logged In

Your output from 
who
 shows 
only your own active sessions
:

console

 â This is your main session (normal macOS login).

ttys000

 â This is your Terminal session.

â 
No unknown users are remotely logged in.

ð¨ 
However, Remote Management services are still running, which means they could be reactivated.

Next Step: Fully Disable Remote Management & Screen Sharing

Since 
Remote Management (
remotemanagementd
) is still running despite being disabled
, we need to 
force stop it
.

ð¨ Step 1: Manually Disable Remote Management

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd

ð¹ 
This forces macOS to unload the Remote Management daemon
 (even if it's running).

ð¨ Step 2: Remove Any Remote Management Settings

Run these commands 
to delete all stored remote management settings
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /var/db/RemoteManagement
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Application\ Support/Apple/RemoteDesktop/

ð¹ 
This ensures Remote Management doesnât restart after reboot.

ð¨ Step 3: Reboot & Verify Remote Management is Gone

Restart your Mac

After reboot, check if 
remotemanagementd
 is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i remote

â 
If nothing appears
, Remote Management is finally gone.

ð¨ 
If itâs still running, weâll need to temporarily disable SIP to remove it permanently.

Let Me Know the Results!

Run 

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd

Run 
the 
rm -rf
 commands

Restart and check if it's still running
 with 
ps aux | grep -i remote

Let me know 
if Remote Management is finally gone or if SIP is still blocking it!

Findings: Remote Management is Now Removed, But AirPlay is Still Protected

â 
Remote Management (
remotemanagementd
) is now gone

â 
No unauthorized remote access processes are running

ð¨ 
AirPlayXPCHelper is still protected because the file system is read-only

The error:

"chmod: Unable to change file mode on /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper: Read-only file system"

This means 
macOS has set 
/usr/libexec
 to a read-only state
, preventing us from modifying or disabling AirPlayXPCHelper.

ð¨ Next Step: Disable SIP Completely & Unlock the Read-Only File System

To modify 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, we need to 
disable SIP fully, including File System Protections
.

â¡ Step-by-Step: Fully Disable SIP to Unlock File System

1ï¸â£ Restart in Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (â) + R

 until you see the Apple logo or macOS Utilities screen.

This boots into 
macOS Recovery Mode
.

2ï¸â£ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar.

Select 
Terminal
.

3ï¸â£ Disable SIP Fully (Including Read-Only File System)

In Terminal, type:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Press 
Enter
 after each command.

You should see 
"Successfully disabled System Integrity Protection"
 and 
"Authenticated root disabled."

4ï¸â£ Restart Your Mac Normally

Click 
Apple Menu > Restart
 to boot into macOS as usual.

ð¨ Step 5: Modify & Disable AirPlayXPCHelper

Once SIP is fully disabled, we can 
force-remove AirPlayXPCHelper
.

1ï¸â£ Disable & Remove AirPlay

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

ð¹ This will 
prevent AirPlayXPCHelper from running.

2ï¸â£ Restart & Confirm AirPlay is Gone

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay
