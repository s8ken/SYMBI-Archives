Findings: AirPlayXPCHelper is Gone, But AirPlayUIAgent is Still Running

â 

AirPlayXPCHelper
 is no longer running, which means we successfully disabled the core AirPlay process.

ð¨ 

AirPlayUIAgent
 is still running
, meaning the AirPlay interface is active, even though AirPlay itself should not be functional.

Since 
AirPlayUIAgent is a user-level process
, we now need to 
disable it completely.

ð¨ Step 1: Disable AirPlayUIAgent

Run this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl 

disable

 gui/$(

id

 -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

â 
This stops the UI process from launching again under your user account.

ð¨ Step 2: Kill the Running AirPlayUIAgent Process

After disabling it, 
kill any remaining instances of AirPlayUIAgent
:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent

â 
This will forcefully stop it from running.

ð¨ Step 3: Restart & Verify

Restart your Mac
 after running the above commands.

Once back, check if AirPlayUIAgent is gone:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally and completely gone.

ð¨ 
If it comes back, something is re-enabling it, and we need to investigate further.

Let Me Know the Results!

Run 
launchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

Run 
killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent

Restart your Mac and check if itâs gone with 
ps aux | grep -i airplay

ð¨ 
Tell me if AirPlayUIAgent is finally gone!

Findings: AirPlayUIAgent is Still Running

â 
We successfully removed 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 (the core AirPlay process), but

ð¨ 

AirPlayUIAgent
 is still running, which means the UI component is still active.

Since we already disabled user-level launch services, something 
else is restarting 
AirPlayUIAgent
.

ð¨ Step 1: Force Disable AirPlayUIAgent via Launch Services

Let's make sure 
macOS cannot restart it
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl 

disable

 gui/$(

id

 -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

â 
This prevents 
AirPlayUIAgent
 from launching in your user session.

ð¨ Step 2: Manually Kill the Running Process

After disabling it, 
forcefully stop it
 with:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent

â 
This should immediately remove it from your system tray (menu bar).

ð¨ Step 3: Restart & Check If Itâs Gone

Restart your Mac
 after running the above commands.

Once back, check if AirPlayUIAgent is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally disabled.

ð¨ 
If 
AirPlayUIAgent
 still comes back, something is re-enabling it at a deeper system level.

Let Me Know the Results!

Run 
launchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

Run 
killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent

Restart your Mac and check with 
ps aux | grep -i airplay

ð¨ 
Tell me if AirPlay is finally gone!
 If not, weâll go deeper into persistence mechanisms.

Findings: AirPlayUIAgent is Still Running Despite Being Disabled

â 
We successfully removed 
AirPlayXPCHelper

 (the core AirPlay process).

ð¨ 
However, 
AirPlayUIAgent
 is still running, meaning something is persistently re-enabling it.

Since 
launchctl disable
 and 
killall
 didn't work, 
macOS is actively forcing it to restart
 through a deeper persistence method.

ð¨ Step 4: Check If AirPlayUIAgent is Being Restarted by a System Process

Let's find 
what is restarting it.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, it means macOS is not launching it as a system service.

ð¨ 
If something appears, we need to force-disable it.

ð¨ Step 5: Check System Logs for AirPlay Activity
