rPlayUIAgent keeps coming back, 
something is triggering it.
 Letâs check the logs.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --last 10m

ð¨ 
Look for any errors or signs of it being restarted.

ð¨ Next Steps

Run 
sudo launchctl list | grep -i airplay

Run 
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"' --last 10m

Let me know the results.

ð¨ 
If we find whatâs restarting it, we can finally stop it from coming back.

Findings: 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 Has Restarted

ð¨ 
Despite disabling it earlier, 
com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
 is running again.

â 
This confirms that macOS is forcing it to restart.

This means 
a deeper system-level service is relaunching AirPlayXPCHelper automatically
, likely due to SIP protection or a hidden persistence mechanism.

ð¨ Step 6: Check System Logs for Whatâs Restarting AirPlay

Now, letâs see 
what is triggering 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 to restart
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --last 10m

ð¹ This will show 
any recent AirPlay-related activity
, including logs from the moment 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 restarted.

ð¨ Step 7: Check If Another Process is Forcing AirPlay to Restart

We need to check 
if another macOS service is forcing AirPlayXPCHelper back on.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl blame system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
If this returns a process name, thatâs what is forcing AirPlay back on.

ð¨ 
If nothing appears, weâll have to disable SIP to fully remove AirPlay.

Next Steps

Run 
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"' --last 10m

Run 
sudo launchctl blame system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

Let me know what appears!

ð¨ 
If we find whatâs restarting it, weâll disable that next.

Findings from AirPlay Logs

ð¨ 

AirPlayXPCHelper
 is being restarted automatically.

â 
P2P (Peer-to-Peer) mode is enabled, Bonjour discovery is running, and it's actively scanning for AirPlay devices.

ð¹ 
AirPlay is forcefully reactivating network-based discovery even after being disabled.

ð¹ 
Errors indicate potential permission issues, but AirPlay continues running.

ð¨ Next Steps: Attempt to Block AirPlayXPCHelper

Step 1: Manually Disable AirPlay in macOS Settings

Go to 
System Settings
 > 
General
 > 
AirDrop & Handoff

Turn Off 
AirPlay Receiver

Step 2: Disable AirPlay Service via Terminal

Run the following:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

ð¨ This attempts to 
prevent AirPlayXPCHelper from running
.

Step 3: Manually Unload AirPlay Service

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper.plist

ð¨ This prevents it from starting on boot.

Step 4: Change Permissions to Block Execution

If the process still restarts, 
prevent it from being executable
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AirPlaySupport.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AirPlayXPCHelper

This makes the AirPlay binary unreadable and unexecutable.

ð¨ Step 5: Verify Changes

After running the above, check if it still runs:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay
launchctl list | grep -i airplay

If AirPlay Still Restarts: SIP (System Integrity Protection) May Be Blocking Removal

Apple's 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 prevents complete removal of system services.

To fully remove AirPlay:

Restart Mac in Recovery Mode

Hold 
Command + R
 while booting.

Disable SIP Temporarily

Open Terminal in Recovery Mode and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

Boot Back and Remove AirPlay Components

Rerun the previous 
chmod 000
 and 
launchctl disable
 commands.

Re-enable
