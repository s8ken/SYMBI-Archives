Let me know what it returns! If AirPlay is unexpectedly active, weâll look into turning it off.

Thanks for checking! The message 
"Domain com.apple.airplay does not exist"
 means that there are 
no user-specific AirPlay settings stored
âwhich is interesting since AirPlay-related processes are still running.

Step 4: Check if AirPlay Mirroring is Enabled in System Settings

Since the processes are running despite AirPlay settings not existing in 
defaults
, let's manually check if 
AirPlay Display or Mirroring is enabled
:

Go to
 â 
System Settings > Displays

Look for an "AirPlay Display" dropdown
 at the bottom.

If it 
says "Off"
, then AirPlay should not be active.

If it 
lists any device
, that means something is connecting via AirPlay.

While the TV is connected, check if the "Screen Mirroring" icon appears in the menu bar
 (top-right of macOS).

If it's visible, AirPlay may be partially active.

Let me know what you find! If there's no sign of AirPlay in the UI, we may need to look at 
log files
 to see why the AirPlay processes are running.

You said:

yes the screen mirroring icon is in purple

ChatGPT said:

Got it! The 
purple Screen Mirroring icon
 means that 
macOS is treating your TV as an AirPlay-like display, even though it appears as a standard external display in system settings.
 This explains why the 
purple indicator appeared
 when you connected the TV but 
not the monitor
.

Step 5: Check Why AirPlay is Active

Since we now know AirPlay is involved, let's check 
why it got activated
.

1. Check Active AirPlay Sessions

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --info --last 10m

This will show recent AirPlay-related events in the last 
10 minutes
.

If you see anything like 
"starting AirPlay session"
 or 
"connected to AirPlay display"
, let me know.

2. Try Disabling AirPlay Display

If you want to 
stop macOS from using AirPlay
 for the TV:

Go to System Settings > Displays

Find "AirPlay Display" and set it to "Off"

Check if the purple indicator disappears

Let me know what you find in the 
logs
 or if disabling AirPlay worked!

ChatGPT said:

You're getting 
"Operation not permitted"
 because macOS restricts access to system logs for security reasons. We need to 
rerun the command with sudo (admin privileges)
.

Step 5 (Retry): Run the Command with Admin Access

Try this instead:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --info --last 10m

Press Enter
 after running the command.

Enter your Mac password
 when prompted (it wonât show while typing).

Check if there are any logs about AirPlay starting a session or connecting to a device.

Let me know what you find!

lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"' --info --last 10m

Password:
lcl is not in the sudoers file.
This incident has been reported to the administrator.
lcl@LCLs-MacBook-Pro ~ % 

ChatGPT said:

Your Mac is saying that your user 
"lcl" is not in the sudoers file
, which means you donât have administrative privileges to run 
sudo
 commands. This could be a 
security restriction
 or a sign that your account doesn't have admin rights.

Step 6: Check If Your Account Has Admin Rights

Let's confirm whether your account is an 
Administrator
:

Go to:

System Settings > Users & Groups

Check your user account ("lcl")

If it
