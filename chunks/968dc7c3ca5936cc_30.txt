Findings: AirPlayXPCHelper is Protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection)

Your output confirms:

ð¨ 
macOS is actively preventing AirPlayXPCHelper from being disabled.

ð¨ 
Even with 
sudo
, the command fails due to "Input/output error."

ð¹ 
The system suggests 
launchctl bootout
, but we already confirmed that fails due to SIP.

ð¨ Next Step: SIP Must Be Temporarily Disabled to Fully Remove AirPlay

Since 
macOS is blocking all attempts to disable AirPlay
, we need to 
temporarily disable SIP (System Integrity Protection)
 in 
Recovery Mode
 to remove AirPlay completely.

â¡ Step-by-Step: Disable SIP and Remove AirPlay Permanently

1ï¸â£ Restart Mac into Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (â) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen
.

2ï¸â£ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

In the 
macOS Utilities window
, go to the 
top menu bar
.

Click 
Utilities > Terminal
.

3ï¸â£ Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)

In Terminal, type:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Press 
Enter
 after each command.

You should see 
"Successfully disabled System Integrity Protection."

4ï¸â£ Restart Your Mac Normally

Click 
Apple Menu > Restart
 to boot into normal macOS.

ð¨ Step 5: Remove AirPlay Components

Once SIP is fully disabled, 
force-remove AirPlayXPCHelper
:

1ï¸â£ Stop AirPlayXPCHelper Immediately

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

2ï¸â£ Make It Unusable

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

ð¨ 
This prevents macOS from launching AirPlayXPCHelper ever again.

ð¨ Step 6: Restart & Verify

Restart your Mac
 and confirm AirPlay is gone with:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is permanently disabled.

ð¨ Step 7: Re-Enable SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone, 
re-enable SIP
 for protection.

1ï¸â£ Restart in Recovery Mode Again

Shut down your Mac.

Hold 

Command (â) + R
 while turning it on
 to enter 
macOS Recovery Mode
.

2ï¸â£ Open Terminal & Re-Enable SIP

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

Press 
Enter
 after each command.

You should see 
"Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection."

3ï¸â£ Restart Normally

Click 
Apple Menu > Restart
 to boot back into macOS.

Final Check: Verify AirPlay is Gone

Once youâre back in macOS, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is permanently disabled.

ð¨ 
If itâs still running, something else is reinstalling it, and weâll investigate deeper.

â ï¸ Important Notes

Disabling SIP & Authenticated Root temporarily is the only way to modify protected system files.

You must re-enable SIP afterward
 to keep your system secure.

If AirPlay still persists after all of this, something is reinstalling it
, which could indicate 
malware or unauthorized persistence mechanisms.

Let me know once you've disabled SIP and removed AirPlayXPCHelper!

Findings: SIP is Already Disabled, Yet AirPlayXPCHelper Still Runs

ð¨ 
Since System Integrity Protection (SIP) is already disabled
, but 
AirPlayXPCHelper is still active
, this means 
something else is forcing it to restart.

Now, letâs forcefully 
remove, block, or disable AirPlayXPCHelper.

ð¨ Step 1: Kill AirPlayXPCHelper Immediately

Since SIP is disabled, this should work now:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
If successful, this should immediately stop AirPlayXPCHelper from running.
