emove permissions
 so macOS cannot restart it.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

ð¨ 
This makes the file unreadable and unexecutable, blocking macOS from using it.

ð¨ Step 3: Delete AirPlayXPCHelper (If Necessary)

If AirPlay still persists, we force-delete it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
If successful, macOS wonât be able to restart it.

ð¨ Step 4: Restart & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac

Once back, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is permanently disabled.

ð¨ 
If it still comes back, something is reinstalling it, and we need to check deeper persistence mechanisms.

Let Me Know the Results!

Run 
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

Run 
sudo chmod 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

If necessary, run 
sudo rm -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

Restart and check if itâs finally gone with 
ps aux | grep -i airplay

ð¨ 
Tell me if the AirPlay icon is FINALLY gone!
 If not, we will investigate further.

Findings: The Root File System is Still Read-Only

ð¨ 
Even though SIP is disabled, macOS still prevents modifications because the root filesystem is in a read-only state.

ð¹ This means 
we need to remount the root filesystem as read/write before we can modify 
AirPlayXPCHelper

.

ð¨ Step 1: Remount Root as Read/Write

Since macOS defaults to a 
read-only system
, we need to temporarily 
remount the root volume as writable.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /

â This should allow us to make system modifications.

ð¨ Step 2: Verify if the File System is Now Writable

After remounting, check if it worked:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount | grep 

" / "

â 
If it says 
read/write
, the file system is now unlocked.

ð¨ 
If it still says 
read-only
, we need to check deeper protections.

ð¨ Step 3: Modify & Remove AirPlayXPCHelper

Now that the system is writable, try again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

If that works, completely remove the file:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
This will permanently remove AirPlayXPCHelper.

ð¨ Step 4: Restart & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally removed.

ð¨ 
If it still comes back, something is reinstalling it, which we need to investigate.

Let Me Know the Results!

Run 
sudo mount -uw /

Check with 
mount | grep " / "

Try 
sudo chmod 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

Try 
sudo rm -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

Restart & check 
ps aux | grep -i airplay

ð¨ 
Let me know if the root filesystem is writable and if AirPlay is finally gone!

ð¨ 
You are getting "Permission Denied" when trying to remount the root filesystem.

ð¨ 
Error code 
66
 means macOS is blocking the mount operation.

ð¹ This means 
we need to manually mount the system in Recovery Mode.

ð¨ Step 1: Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Since macOS wonât allow changes in normal mode, we need to:

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold
