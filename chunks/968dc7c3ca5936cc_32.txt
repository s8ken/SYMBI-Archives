mmand (â) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen
.

ð¨ Step 2: Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar.

Select 
Terminal
.

ð¨ Step 3: Manually Remount Root as Writable

Run the following command:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

â If successful, the system should now be writable.

ð¨ Step 4: Disable Sealed System Volume (SSV)

Since macOS 
Big Sur and later use Signed System Volume (SSV)
, we need to disable it temporarily:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

â This allows full modifications of system files.

ð¨ Step 5: Restart & Modify AirPlayXPCHelper

Restart your Mac normally.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â This should now allow deletion of AirPlayXPCHelper.

ð¨ Step 6: Re-Enable SSV & SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone:

Reboot into Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
 while restarting).

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

Final Check: Verify AirPlay is Gone

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â If nothing appears, 
AirPlay is permanently disabled.

Let Me Know the Results!

Try remounting 
/
 in Recovery Mode.

Try disabling 
authenticated-root
.

Restart and see if AirPlay can be removed.

ð¨ If the system 
still wonât let you mount as writable
, let me know!

Findings: Root File System is Still Read-Only, Even with SIP Disabled

ð¨ 
You're still getting "Read-only file system" errors
 when trying to modify or delete 
AirPlayXPCHelper
.

ð¹ This means 
macOSâs Sealed System Volume (SSV) is still protecting system files.

Even though 
SIP is disabled
, 
SSV prevents any modifications to 
/usr/libexec/
.

To remove 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, we 
must disable SSV, mount the root as writable, then remove the file.

ð¨ Step-by-Step: Fully Unlock & Remove AirPlayXPCHelper

Since macOS 
Big Sur and later
 introduced 
SSV
, we must first 
disable it in Recovery Mode.

1ï¸â£ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (â) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen.

2ï¸â£ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar.

Select 
Terminal
.

3ï¸â£ Disable SSV (Sealed System Volume)

Since macOS wonât let us edit system files, we need to 
disable SSV and remount the disk as writable.

Run these commands 
in Recovery Mode
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

â 
This disables SSV, allowing system modifications.

4ï¸â£ Remount Root as Writable

Now, remount the system partition so we can make changes:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

â 
If successful, your root filesystem is now writable.

5ï¸â£ Delete AirPlayXPCHelper

Now that the filesystem is writable, try again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
If successful, AirPlayXPCHelper will be permanently removed.

6ï¸â£ Reboot & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac normally.

Run this command to check if AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally removed.

7ï¸â£ Re-Enable SSV & SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone:

Reboot into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 on restart).

Run these commands to restore normal system security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

ð¨ Let Me Know the Results!

Try disabling 
authenticated-root
 in Recovery Mode.

Try remount
