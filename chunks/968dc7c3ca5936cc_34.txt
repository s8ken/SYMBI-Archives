Findings: Memory Is Not Critically Low, But Root File System Is Still Read-Only

â 
Your Mac has 16GB of RAM (
hw.memsize: 17179869184
), and memory usage looks normal.

ð¨ 
However, the root filesystem is still read-only, preventing AirPlayXPCHelper from being modified or removed.

ð¹ This confirms that 
SSV (Sealed System Volume) is still enforced, blocking system file changes.

ð¨ Next Step: Ensure SSV Is Disabled & Root is Writable

Even if 
SIP is disabled
, 
SSV must also be disabled and the root volume remounted as writable.

1ï¸â£ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (â) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen.

2ï¸â£ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar.

Select 
Terminal
.

3ï¸â£ Ensure SSV (Sealed System Volume) is Disabled

Run the following command:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

â This ensures that 
macOS does not enforce the read-only system volume.

4ï¸â£ Remount Root as Writable

After disabling SSV, 
remount the system volume as writable:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

â 
If this works, your system is now writable.

ð¨ 
If it fails again with "Permission Denied," macOS is still enforcing SSV.

5ï¸â£ Restart & Modify AirPlayXPCHelper

Once the system is writable, restart your Mac normally.

Then, try these commands again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
If successful, AirPlayXPCHelper will be permanently removed.

6ï¸â£ Reboot & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac normally.

Run this command to check if AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally removed.

7ï¸â£ Re-Enable SSV & SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone:

Reboot into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 on restart).

Run these commands to restore normal system security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

ð¨ Let Me Know the Results!

Try disabling 
authenticated-root
 in Recovery Mode.

Try remounting 
/
 as writable.

Remove 
AirPlayXPCHelper
.

Restart and check if it's gone.

ð¨ 
If you still get "Read-only file system," let me know!
