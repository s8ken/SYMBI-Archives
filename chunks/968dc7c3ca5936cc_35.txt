 Command Not Found in Recovery Mode

ð¨ 
In macOS Recovery Mode, the 
sudo
 command is sometimes unavailable.

ð¹ This is because 
Recovery Mode runs a minimal shell environment
 with limited commands.

Solution:
 You donât need 
sudo
 in Recovery Mode because the Terminal already has root privileges.

ð¨ Next Steps: Run Commands Without 
sudo

If you see 
"command not found" for 
sudo

, just 
remove 
sudo

 and run the commands normally.

1ï¸â£ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (â) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen.

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar â Select 
Terminal
.

2ï¸â£ Disable System Protections (SSV & SIP)

In Recovery Mode, run these commands 
without 
sudo

:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

csrutil 

disable

â This 
fully disables System Integrity Protection (SIP) and the Sealed System Volume (SSV).

3ï¸â£ Remount Root as Writable

After disabling protections, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

â 
If successful, your system volume is now writable.

ð¨ 
If this still fails, macOS is forcing read-only mode due to corruption or security settings.

4ï¸â£ Delete AirPlayXPCHelper

Once the system is writable, try:

sh

Copy

Edit

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
This will permanently remove AirPlayXPCHelper.

5ï¸â£ Restart & Verify

Restart your Mac normally.

Check if AirPlay is gone:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is fully removed.

6ï¸â£ Re-Enable Security Protections

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone:

Reboot into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 on restart).

Run these commands to restore SIP & SSV:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart your Mac.

ð¨ Let Me Know the Results!

Try the commands without 
sudo
 in Recovery Mode.

Try remounting 
/
 as writable.

Delete AirPlayXPCHelper and restart.

Check if it's finally gone with 
ps aux | grep -i airplay
.

ð¨ 
If you still get "Read-only file system," let me know!

You said:

oh I have to do it without the sudo 

ChatGPT said:

Yes! 
In Recovery Mode, 
sudo
 is not needed
 because you are already running as 
root
. Just remove 
sudo
 from the commands and try again.

ð¨ Steps to Fully Remove AirPlayXPCHelper

Since 
SSV and SIP are already disabled
, now we just need to 
remount the root volume as writable and delete AirPlayXPCHelper.

1ï¸â£ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

If youâre not already in 
Recovery Mode
, restart your Mac and hold 

Command (â) + R

 until you see 
macOS Utilities
.

Then, click 
Utilities > Terminal
.

2ï¸â£ Remount Root as Writable

Run this 
without 
sudo

:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

â If successful, the 
root filesystem is now writable.

3ï¸â£ Remove AirPlayXPCHelper

Now that the system is writable, 
delete AirPlayXPCHelper
:

sh

Copy

Edit

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
If successful, AirPlayXPCHelper is permanently removed.

4ï¸â£ Restart & Verify

Restart your Mac normally.

Run this command to check if AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is fully removed.

5ï¸â£ Re-Enable Security Protections (Final Step)

Once you confirm AirPlay is gone:

Restart into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 while rebooting).

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

ð¨ Let Me Know the Results!

Try the commands without 
sudo
.

Verify AirPlay is gone after reboot (
ps aux | grep -i airplay
).

Re-enable SIP & SSV once confirmed.

ð¨ 
If "Read-only file system" still appears, let me know immediately!
