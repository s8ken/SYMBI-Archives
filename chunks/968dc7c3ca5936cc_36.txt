Yes! You Need to Delete 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 While in Recovery Mode

Since 
SIP (System Integrity Protection) and SSV (Sealed System Volume) are already disabled
, you 
must
 delete 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 from 
Recovery Mode
 because macOS prevents modifications in normal mode.

ð¨ Steps to Delete 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 in Recovery Mode

1ï¸â£ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (â) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen.

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar â Select 
Terminal
.

2ï¸â£ Remount Root as Writable

Since the root file system is still 
read-only
, we must 
remount it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

â 
If this works, your system is now writable.

ð¨ 
If you still get "Read-only file system," let me know!

3ï¸â£ Delete 
AirPlayXPCHelper

Now that the system is writable, delete AirPlayXPCHelper:

sh

Copy

Edit

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

â 
This permanently removes AirPlayXPCHelper.

4ï¸â£ Restart & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac normally.

Run this command to check if AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is fully removed.

5ï¸â£ Re-Enable Security Protections (Final Step)

Once you confirm AirPlay is gone:

Restart into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 while rebooting).

Run these commands to restore SIP & SSV:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

ð¨ Let Me Know the Results!

Try deleting 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 in Recovery Mode.

Check if it's gone after reboot (
ps aux | grep -i airplay
).

Re-enable SIP & SSV once confirmed.

ð¨ 
If "Read-only file system" still appears, let me know immediately!
