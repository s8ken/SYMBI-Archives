It looks like the last command didn't execute properly due to an 
incomplete command entry
. Let's go step by step.

ð¨ Step 1: Re-run the Full Command Properly

Since your Terminal got stuck in 
pipe dquote>
, 
press 
Ctrl + C
 to cancel
 and then re-run this:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

â 
This will check again if any hidden AirPlay-related processes are running.

ð ï¸ Step 2: Manually Remove AirPlay UI Agent

If the purple icon is still showing, try this 
one at a time
:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent

â 
This force-closes the AirPlay UI process.

If the icon persists, clear cached preferences:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults delete com.apple.airplay
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This resets AirPlay preferences and refreshes the menu bar.

ð Step 3: Restart & Check If the Icon is Gone

Restart your Mac.

Once back in macOS, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

â 
If nothing appears and the icon is gone, AirPlay is fully removed.

ð¨ If the Icon is Still There:

Let me know if:

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent
 worked or not.

defaults delete com.apple.airplay && killall SystemUIServer
 made any changes.

If the icon disappears after a restart or still remains.
