ð¨ Findings: AirPlay is Fully Disabled, but the Icon Persists

â 
No AirPlay-related processes are running.

â 
No 
AirPlayUIAgent
 process exists anymore.

â 
No stored AirPlay settings (
com.apple.airplay
 domain not found).

ð¨ 
But the purple icon is still visible, meaning itâs a UI issue, not an active service.

ð Next Steps to Remove the Stuck AirPlay Icon

Since the 
backend service is removed but the UI is still showing the icon
, we need to 
force macOS to refresh its menu bar and system UI cache.

ð ï¸ Step 1: Force-Refresh the macOS Menu Bar

Try this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

â 
This restarts the macOS menu bar and should remove the AirPlay icon if it's stuck.

ðï¸ Step 2: Reset UI Preferences

If the icon persists, 
reset menu bar settings
 with:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults delete com.apple.systemuiserver
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This removes any stuck UI elements, including the AirPlay icon.

ð Step 3: Restart & Confirm

Restart your Mac.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

â 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is fully gone.

ð¨ 
If the icon is still there, it could be an issue with the Display settings.

ð¥ï¸ Step 4: Check Display Settings (If Needed)

If the icon 
is still there after a restart
, check:

Go to 
System Settings
 â 
Displays
.

Look for an option called 
âAirPlay Displayâ or âShow mirroring options in menu barâ

Disable any related options

â 
This should remove the AirPlay icon if it is UI-related.

ð¨ Let Me Know What Happens!

Did 
killall SystemUIServer
 remove the icon?

Did 
defaults delete com.apple.systemuiserver
 work?

After a restart, is the icon still there?

What do you see in 
System Settings > Displays
?

â Confirmation: AirPlay & Remote Services Are Fully Disabled

ð 
Your system shows no active AirPlay, screen sharing, screen capture, or VNC processes.

â 
This confirms that all AirPlay-related services are removed and not running.

ð¨ 
However, the purple icon is still visible, meaning it's a UI issue rather than an active process.

ð Next Steps to Remove the Stuck AirPlay Icon

Since the icon persists 
even though the service is gone
, macOS may still be displaying it as a leftover UI artifact.

ð ï¸ Step 1: Restart SystemUIServer

Try this first:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

â 
This forces macOS to refresh the menu bar.

ð¹ 
Did the icon disappear? Let me know.

ðï¸ Step 2: Reset System UI Preferences

If the icon is still there, 
reset the UI settings
:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults delete com.apple.systemuiserver
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This clears stuck UI elements and refreshes the menu bar.

ð¹ 
Check if the icon disappears after running this.

ð Step 3: Restart & Verify

Restart your Mac.

Check if the icon is still there.

ð¥ï¸ Step 4: Check Display Settings

If the icon 
is still there after a restart
