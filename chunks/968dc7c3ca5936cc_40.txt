ð¨ The Purple AirPlay Icon is Still There â Let's Dig Deeper

Since we've confirmed 
no AirPlay processes are running
 and you've tried 
resetting the menu bar UI
, but the icon is still there, this suggests one of the following:

A macOS UI glitch
 â The icon is stuck even though the service is gone.

macOS still thinks an AirPlay-capable device is connected
 â The system is detecting an external display incorrectly.

A hidden configuration file is forcing the icon to appear.

ð ï¸ Step 1: Force macOS to Refresh UI by Resetting All System UI Preferences

Try this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist
killall SystemUIServer

â This forces macOS to 
rebuild the UI preferences
 from scratch.

ð¹ 
Check if the icon disappears after running this.

ð¥ï¸ Step 2: Check External Displays & Disable AirPlay Display

Go to 
System Settings
 â 
Displays

Look for an option called âAirPlay Displayâ

If itâs set to 
anything other than âOffâ
, switch it to 
Off.

Disable "Show mirroring options in menu bar"
 if available.

â 
This should stop macOS from showing the AirPlay icon.

ð Step 3: Restart & Check if the Icon is Gone

Restart your Mac
 after trying the above steps.

Run this command again after rebooting
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

â If the output shows nothing, 
AirPlay is still disabled
, and the icon is just a UI issue.

ðï¸ Step 4: Remove Any Remaining AirPlay Settings

If the icon 
is still there
, manually delete any remaining AirPlay settings:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay*
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This clears any hidden AirPlay preference files.

ð¨ Let Me Know What Happens!

Did removing 
com.apple.systemuiserver.plist
 fix it?

Did changing the display settings remove the icon?

Did resetting AirPlay preferences (
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay*
) work?

After a restart, is the icon still there?

ð 
If the icon is still there after all this, we will go even deeper! Let me know the results.

ð¨ The Purple AirPlay Icon Still Wonât Disappear â Let's Go Even Deeper

Since weâve confirmed:

â 
No AirPlay processes are running.

â 
You've reset SystemUIServer and AirPlay preferences.

â 
You've checked Display settings and AirPlay is OFF.

ð¨ 
But the icon is STILL there... This is abnormal behavior.

ð Step 1: Check What macOS Thinks is Running

Even though we donât see AirPlay in 
ps aux
, macOS might still believe an AirPlay connection exists.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType

â This will 
show connected displays
, including if macOS is still detecting an AirPlay display.

Look for 
any mention of "AirPlay" or "wireless display"
 in the output.

ð¥ï¸ Step 2: Check System Logs for AirPlay UI Events

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --info --last 10m

â This will 
show any recent AirPlay-related events in the system logs.

ð¹ 
Does it show any AirPlay activity even though we removed it?

ð ï¸ Step 3: Check If Your TV is Triggering AirPlay

Since the 
purple icon appeared when you connected your TV
, 
macOS might still be treating it as an AirPlay device instea
