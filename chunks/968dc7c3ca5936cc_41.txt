d of a normal display.

Disconnect your TV completely
 (physically unplug HDMI or turn off the TV).

Restart your Mac.

Check if the icon disappears after reboot.

â 
If the icon disappears, macOS was misidentifying the TV as an AirPlay display.

ð¨ 
If the icon is still there, macOS is stuck in an incorrect AirPlay state.

ð Step 4: Manually Unload Any AirPlay Services

Even though AirPlay was removed, try manually unloading any hidden system services:

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl list | grep -i airplay

If anything appears, try:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

â This ensures 
no hidden AirPlay daemons are still registered.

ð Step 5: Reset NVRAM & SMC (To Fix Stuck UI States)

If the icon 
is still there
, macOS might be 
stuck in a persistent UI state.

Reset NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM)

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it on and immediately hold 
Option + Command + P + R

 for 
20 seconds
 until you hear the startup chime a second time.

Release the keys and let it boot normally.

â 
This resets display settings, UI caches, and AirPlay status.

ð¨ Let Me Know What Happens!

Did 
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
 show any AirPlay displays?

Did 
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'
 reveal anything?

Did unplugging your TV make the icon disappear?

Did 
launchctl list | grep -i airplay
 return anything?

Did resetting NVRAM finally remove the icon?

ð 
Weâre closing in on the issue! Let me know what happens after trying these steps.
