â 
No AirPlay services running

â 
But system logs still show AirPlay errors

ð¨ 
Your Mac is detecting the TV as an "AV Receiver," which might be triggering the icon.

ð What We Learned From Your Logs

Your TV is appearing as an "AV Receiver."

macOS might be 
treating it as an AirPlay receiver
 rather than a normal display.

AirPlay logs show connection errors (
kConnectionErr -6753
).

This means macOS is 
trying and failing to communicate with an AirPlay service
âeven though we removed it.

AirPlayReceiverKit
 is still "advertising access."

This suggests some AirPlay-related feature is still 
enabled on a UI level
 (even though the backend is gone).

ð Next Steps to Finally Remove the Icon

We now 
focus on two things
:

Stopping macOS from treating your TV as an AirPlay receiver.

Forcing macOS to forget AirPlay preferences permanently.

ð¥ï¸ Step 1: Disconnect the TV & Restart

Physically unplug the HDMI cable from the Mac
 (or turn off the TV).

Restart your Mac
 and check if the icon disappears.

â 
If the icon disappears, the TV was triggering AirPlay.

ð¨ 
If it's still there, continue to Step 2.

ð ï¸ Step 2: Disable AirPlay Receiver at System Level

Even though 
AirPlay is removed
, macOS still 
thinks your Mac can receive AirPlay streams.

Try disabling this feature manually:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults write com.apple.airplay receiver-enabled -bool NO
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This tells macOS to stop acting as an AirPlay receiver.

ð¹ 
Check if the icon disappears after this command.

ðï¸ Step 3: Delete Hidden AirPlay Service Files

Even though we removed AirPlayâs core services, some preference files might still exist.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay*
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay*
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This removes any leftover AirPlay preferences.

ð¹ 
Restart your Mac after this and check if the icon is gone.

ð Step 4: Force Remove Any Remaining AirPlay Services

Even though 
launchctl
 didnât show active AirPlay services before, letâs try 
one last force removal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This forces any remaining AirPlay UI services to shut down.

ð¨ Let Me Know What Happens!

Did unplugging the TV remove the icon?

Did 
defaults write com.apple.airplay receiver-enabled -bool NO
 help?

Did deleting AirPlay preferences (
rm -rf
) fix it?

Does 
launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
 return any errors?

ð 
If the icon is still there after all this, weâll go even deeper! Let me know what happens.

â Confirmed: The TV is Triggering the AirPlay Icon

ð 
Weâve found the root cause!
 Your Mac is 
not running AirPlay
, but 
it thinks your TV is an AirPlay-compatible receiver.

â 
Unplugging the TV instantly removes the icon.

ð¨ 
Reconnecting the TV brings the icon back.

ð Why This is Happening

Your TV is being detected as an "AV Receiver"
 (as shown in 
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
).

macOS 
thinks it's an AirPlay target
, even though we removed AirPlay services.

This is a UI-only issue
âAirPlay is not active, but macOS is 
still recognizing AirPlay-capable devices
.

ð Final Fix: Stop macOS From Detecting the TV as an AirPlay Receiver

Since we now 
know the trigger
, we need to 
force macOS to stop treating your TV as an AirPlay device.

ð ï¸ Step 1: Manually Disable AirPlay for External Displays

Run this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults write com.apple.airplay receiver-enabled -bool NO
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This tells macOS to stop acting as an AirPlay receiver.

ð¹ 
Reconnect your TV and check if the icon still appears.

ð¥ï¸ Step 2: Check Display Settings (Disable Mirroring)
