Find your 
TV (AV Receiver)

Look for an "AirPlay Display" option and set it to "Off."

Uncheck "Show mirroring options in menu bar when available."

â 
This tells macOS to stop treating the TV as an AirPlay display.

ð Step 3: Prevent AirPlay from Auto-Connecting

Even though AirPlay services are removed, 
macOS might still remember your TV
 as an AirPlay device.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay*
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay*
killall SystemUIServer

â 
This deletes any stored settings that associate your Mac with the TV.

ð¨ Let Me Know What Happens!

Does 
defaults write com.apple.airplay receiver-enabled -bool NO
 stop the icon?

Does disabling "AirPlay Display" in System Settings fix it?

Does deleting 
com.apple.airplay*
 preferences help?

ð 
Weâre almost there! Let me know if the icon finally disappears for good.

ð Final Steps: Re-Enable SIP & Restart

Now that weâve confirmed 
AirPlay is fully disabled and the issue was the TV being detected as an AirPlay receiver
, you can safely 
re-enable System Integrity Protection (SIP) and restart.

ð ï¸ Steps to Re-Enable SIP

Restart your Mac and boot into Recovery Mode:

For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):

Shut down your Mac.

Press and hold 
Power Button
 until 
"Loading startup options"
 appears.

Click 
Options
 â 
Continue
 to enter macOS Recovery.

For Intel Macs:

Restart and 
hold 
Command (â) + R

 immediately until the Apple logo appears.

Once in Recovery Mode, open Terminal:

Click 
Utilities
 â 
Terminal
.

Run the following command to enable SIP:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

â 
This turns System Integrity Protection back on.

Restart your Mac normally.

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

â 
After rebooting, SIP will be fully enabled again.

ð¨ Final Check After Restart

After restarting:

Reconnect the TV.

Check if the purple icon appears again.

â If the icon 
stays gone
, AirPlay detection is fully disabled.

ð¨ If the icon 
comes back
, let me know, and weâll check for hidden system processes.

ð 
Let me know how it goes after enabling SIP and restarting!

sip is back on

ChatGPT said:

â SIP is Back On â Final Confirmation

ð 
Great! Your system integrity is restored.

Now, let's do a 
final check
 to ensure everything is working correctly.

ð Step 1: Confirm AirPlay is Still Disabled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

â 
This checks if any AirPlay-related services are running.

ð¨ 
If something shows up, let me know.

ð¥ï¸ Step 2: Reconnect the TV and Check the Icon

Physically reconnect the TV (or turn it on).

Watch the menu bar:

If the purple AirPlay icon comes back,
 macOS is still detecting the TV as an AirPlay receiver.

If the icon stays gone,
 the issue is fully resolved.

ð Step 3: Final Display Settings Check

Go to 
System Settings
 â 
Displays

Find your 
TV (AV Receiver)

Ensure "AirPlay Display" is OFF

Uncheck "Show mirroring options in menu bar when available"

â 
This stops macOS from showing AirPlay controls when an external display is connected.

ð Let Me Know the Final Results!

Does 
ps aux
 still show no AirPlay processes?

Does reconnecting the TV bring the icon back?

Is everything working normally after SIP is enabled?

ð 
If the icon stays gone, youâre 100% in the clear! If it comes back, weâll take a deeper look.
