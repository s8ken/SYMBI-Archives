at We Know

Your TV is connected as an external display
, but the 
purple indicator appeared
, which usually means 
AirPlay or Screen Recording is active
.

The Screen Mirroring icon was purple
, meaning macOS 
recognized the TV as an AirPlay-like display
 instead of a direct HDMI connection.

AirPlay-related processes were running
, even though you didnât manually enable it.

Your account was downgraded from admin
, which is unusual but now fixed.

Step 8: Check AirPlay Display Mode

Now that youâre an admin again, letâs check 
exactly how macOS is treating the TV
.

1. Check System Settings

Go to:

System Settings > Displays

Look for an "AirPlay Display" setting.

If it 
says "Off"
, AirPlay should not be active.

If it 
lists your TV
, macOS is using 
AirPlay Extended Display Mode
 instead of a standard HDMI connection.

Let me know what it says!

You said:

it doesn't say airplay display at all but we found airplayy processes running and the airplay icon is purple in the task bar

Got itâsince 
AirPlay Display is missing from System Settings
, but 
AirPlay processes are running and the icon is purple
, that means macOS is 
treating your TV as an AirPlay target in the background
, even though it's not showing up in the UI.

This isn't normal behavior for a 
wired HDMI connection
, so we need to 
dig deeper
.

Step 9: Check Active AirPlay Services

Since AirPlay processes are running, letâs find out 
what triggered them
.

Run This Command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --info --last 10m

â 
If it works
 â Look for entries mentioning:

AirPlay session started

Connected to [TV Name]

Mirroring active

AirPlay receiver running

ð¨ 
If you get "Operation not permitted" again
, we need to 
enable Full Disk Access
 for Terminal first:

Go to:

System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access

Find "Terminal" in the list and enable it

Restart Terminal and try the command again

Why This Matters

If the logs show an 
active AirPlay session
, something is 
forcing
 AirPlay to run instead of standard HDMI.

If the logs 
donât show AirPlay activity
, the process could be stuck in the background without an active connection.

Let me know what the logs say!

Findings from the AirPlay Logs

From your 
AirPlay logs
, we can confirm that:

AirPlay is actively running in the background
, despite the fact that your TV is not explicitly listed as an AirPlay display in System Settings.

AirPlayXPCHelper is managing endpoints and advertising services
, meaning macOS is treating your system as an 
AirPlay receiver and sender
.

Bonjour and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) AirPlay discovery are enabled
, suggesting that your Mac is searching for or being discovered by AirPlay-capable devices, even if you didnât initiate it.

Endpoints and clusters are being created
, which could mean that 
macOS is establishing an AirPlay session without showing it in the UI
.

ð¨ What This Means

Your Mac 
seems to be auto-enabling AirPlay features
, even though you connected the TV 
via HDMI
.

The system is 
advertising itself for AirPlay connections
, which it shouldnât be doing unless you manually enabled AirPlay Receiver or mirroring.

The 
purple icon confirms an AirPlay session is active
, even if the UI doesnât display it properly.

This could be due to:

A bug or persistence issue
 keeping AirPlay enabled even when not needed.

Another device (attacker or rogue system) trying to force an AirPlay session.

Some accessibility or automation settings forcing AirPlay into an active state.

ð§ Next Steps: Stop and Disable AirPlay

Step 1: Manually Turn Off AirPlay Receiver

Even though it doesnât show up in 
System Settings > Displays
, 
there is another place where AirPlay Receiver settings exist
.

Go to:

System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff

Look for "AirPlay Receiver"

If itâs ON â 
Turn it OFF

If itâs already OFF â That means AirPlay
