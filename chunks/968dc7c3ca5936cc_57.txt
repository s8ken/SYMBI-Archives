Custom Scripts:

There are scripts available that can disable AirPlay by modifying system permissions or settings. However, these often require disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP), which may not be advisable in a production environment. For instance, a GitHub Gist provides a script to disable AirPlay by changing permissions on the 
AirPlayUIAgent
 executable. 

Considerations:

System Integrity Protection (SIP):

Many methods to disable AirPlay involve altering system files, which SIP protects.

Temporarily disabling SIP can allow these changes but may expose the system to security risks.

Re-enabling SIP after making the changes is crucial.

MDM Deployment:

Utilizing an MDM solution provides centralized control and is the recommended approach for managing multiple devices in an organization.

This method ensures compliance with organizational policies without compromising system security.

Recommendation:

For a secure and scalable solution, implementing an MDM strategy to deploy configuration profiles that disable AirPlay is advisable.

This approach aligns with enterprise best practices and maintains system integrity.

If you're managing a personal device, carefully consider the implications of disabling SIP before making system-level changes.

Enterprise Solutions to Disable AirPlay:

Configuration Profiles via MDM (Mobile Device Management):

Organizations often use MDM solutions to enforce device configurations, including disabling AirPlay. By deploying a configuration profile, you can set the 
allowAirPlay
 key to 
false
, effectively preventing AirPlay functionality.

Jamf Pro Example:

Administrators have utilized Jamf Pro to disable AirPlay Receiver by creating a custom configuration profile. This involves using a JSON schema with the domain
