is being forced by another process.

Let me know what you find there.

Step 2: Kill AirPlay Processes

Since 
AirPlayXPCHelper is actively running
, we can try stopping it manually.

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to stop AirPlay-related processes:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo pkill -9 AirPlayXPCHelper

If 
sudo
 doesnât work, try:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayXPCHelper

After running it, check if:

The 
purple AirPlay icon disappears
 from the menu bar.

Your 
TV stays connected as a regular display without AirPlay interference
.

Step 3: Prevent AirPlay From Restarting

To 
stop AirPlay from auto-running
, disable its system service.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

Then restart your Mac to see if AirPlay stops being forced.

What to Look Out For

If 
AirPlay reactivates after killing the process
, we might be dealing with 
a deeper persistence mechanism
.

If 
AirPlay Receiver was already OFF
, that means something else is triggering AirPlay sessions 
outside of user control
.

If you 
see another device trying to connect via AirPlay
, that could indicate unauthorized network activity.

Let me know what happens after 
turning off AirPlay Receiver and killing the process

its all off 

ChatGPT said:

Good! Since 
AirPlay Receiver is off and the processes are no longer running
, that means weâve successfully stopped it for now.

Final Check: Confirm AirPlay Stays Disabled

To make sure AirPlay doesnât automatically restart:

1. Restart Your Mac

After restarting, 
check if the purple indicator appears again.

If 
AirPlay stays off
, weâve solved the issue.

If it 
comes back
, something is forcing it to restart.

2. Check if AirPlay Processes Are Still Gone

After rebooting, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If 
AirPlayXPCHelper is gone
, thatâs a â good sign. If itâs back, we need to investigate persistence.

What This Tells Us

If 
AirPlay stays off
, it was likely a system bug keeping it active.

If 
AirPlay turns back on
, something (malware, automation, or another system process) is forcing it to restart.

After rebooting, let me know 
if AirPlay stays disabled or if it comes back!

no hang on I mean the settings

You said:

you have gone way too far again!

ChatGPT said:

Understood! Let's slow down and focus only on 
the settings you checked.

So far, you've confirmed:

AirPlay Receiver is OFF
 in 
System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff
.

**Thereâs no option for "AirPlay Display

Got it! Let's take it step by step.

Step 1: Confirm AirPlay Receiver Setting

Since you mentioned 
"it's all off"
, letâs double-check:

Go to:

System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff

Confirm "AirPlay Receiver" is OFF.

Can you confirm that it's 
definitely OFF
? Let me know before we move to the next step.

You said:

no you wait for me to prompt you 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! I'll wait for you to update me before we move forward. Let me know what you'd like to check next.

You said:

I have gone to airplay and handoff and all the settings are turned off

ChatGPT said:

Thanks for confirming! Since all 
AirPlay & Handoff settings are OFF
, macOS should not be initiating any AirPlay connections.

Now, let me know what youâd like to check next. Do you want to:

See if the purple indicator is still appearing?

Check if AirPlay processes are still running in the background?

Look into why AirPlay was activating despite these settings being off?

Iâll wait for your direction.

You said:

I'm telling you the purple icon is there and we know processes are running!!

ChatGPT said:

Understood! Since 
AirPlay is turned off in settings, but the purple icon is still there and processes are running
, something is forcing AirPlay to stay active despite your settings.
