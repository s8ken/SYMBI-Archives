I understand you're aiming to disable AirPlay on your Mac by modifying system files, specifically using 
Chrisgeo's script
. 
To achieve this, it's necessary to make the system volume writable, especially on macOS Big Sur and later versions, where the system volume is sealed and read-only by default.
 Here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide to assist you:

â ï¸ Important Note:

Modifying system files can impact your Mac's functionality. Ensure you have 
backed up your data
 before proceeding. Additionally, this process requires temporarily disabling 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 and the 
Authenticated Root Requirement
, which are security features in macOS.

1ï¸â£ Temporarily Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Authenticated Root

Restart Your Mac in Recovery Mode:

Shut down your Mac.

Press the power button and immediately hold down 
Command (â) + R
 until the Apple logo appears.

Open Terminal in Recovery Mode:

In the top menu, click on 
Utilities
 and select 
Terminal
.

Disable SIP and Authenticated Root:

In Terminal, type:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Press 
Enter
 after each command.

Restart your Mac.

2ï¸â£ Mount the System Volume as Writable

In macOS Big Sur and later, the system volume is sealed and read-only by default. To make changes:

Identify the System Volume:

Open 
Terminal
.

toolbox.easeus.com

+1

elitemacx86.com

+1

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil list

Locate your system volume (typically named "Macintosh HD").

Create a Mount Point:

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo 

mkdir

 /System/Volumes/Update/mnt

Mount the System Volume as Writable:

Replace 
/dev/disk3s3
 with your actual system volume identifier found in step 1.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs /dev/disk3s3 /System/Volumes/Update/mnt

3ï¸â£ Download and Prepare Chrisgeo's Script

Access the Script:

Visit Chrisgeo's GitHub Gist.

Copy the Script:

Select all the code in the Gist and copy it.
