.

3. Disable SIP and allow modifications of the system volume

In Terminal, run:

shell

Copy

Edit

csrutil disable
csrutil authenticated-root disable

4. Restart back into macOS normally:

Type:

shell

Copy

Edit

reboot

5. Remount the system volume as writable (once booted normally):

Open Terminal and run:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /
sudo killall Finder

At this stage, the system volume 
/
 is writable, and you can apply Chrisgeoâs script or manual changes to disable AirPlay components.

Why the earlier permission issue occurred:

You cannot directly execute or access disk partitions (
/dev/disk3s3
) as regular files or commands.

You must mount the 
system volume
 (
/
) as writable using the correct syntax shown above.

Follow these exact instructions to achieve a writable system volume safely. Let me know if you need further help.

Hereâs exactly how to do it clearly, step-by-step:

â Step-by-Step to Make System Writable on macOS:

Step 1: Boot into Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Press and hold the 
Power Button
 (on M1/M2 MacBooks) until you see 
"Loading startup options"
.

Select 
Options
, then click 
Continue
 to boot into 
Recovery Mode
.

Step 2: Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Once Recovery loads:

From the top menu, select:

Utilities
 â 
Terminal

Step 3: Disable SIP and Enable Writable System Volume

In Terminal, enter these commands one by one:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Both commands must say they've successfully completed.

Step 4: Restart Normally

Still in Terminal, type:

bash

Copy

Edit

reboot

Your Mac will restart normally.

Now, once your Mac boots normally:

Step 5: Mount the System Volume as Writable

Open a normal Terminal window, and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /
sudo killall Finder

After this command, your system volume (
/
) is writable, and you can proceed to run the AirPlay disable script from Chrisgeo or apply manual changes as intended.

â ï¸ Important Notes:

After you've finished your modifications, you'll later re-enable SIP to protect your system again by booting back into Recovery and running:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

You don't need to immediately reboot again after booting normally; you can do your tasks first
, and once complete, then reboot back into Recovery mode to enable SIP again.

Confirm once you reach this stage, or if you have any questions.

This error occurs because the snapshot is still active, preventing you from mounting the volume as writable.

Let's fix it clearly, step by step:

â Correct Steps to Fix the "Permission Denied (66)" error:

Step 1: Boot into Recovery Mode again

Shut down
 your Mac.

Press and hold 
Power
 until you see 
"Loading startup options"
.

Select 
Options
, then 
Continue
.

Step 2: Open Terminal in Recovery

Click 
Utilities â Terminal
 from the top menu.

Step 3: Properly Mount the System Volume as Writable in Recovery

Run this command exactly:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

If the command above gives you an error like 
mount_apfs: volume could not be mounted: Permission denied
, run the following commands exactly to find and mount the correct volume:

1. 
Find your system volume
:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil apfs list

From the output, identify your macOS volume (likely labeled 
Macintosh HD
). It will look something like this:

mathematica

Copy

Edit

Volume

diskXsY

Mount

Point

:

/

Volume

Name

:

Macintosh

HD

For example, if it's 
disk3s3
, proceed:

2. 
Mount volume explicitly
 (replace 
disk3s3
 with the volume you identified):

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /dev/disk3s3

Now, your system volume should successfully mount as writable.

Step 4: Verify Writable Mount
