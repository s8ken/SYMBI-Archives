ure no error appears. If no error, you're good.

You can now safely proceed to your original planâdeleting or modifying AirPlay files as per the script you planned to use.

Next Steps After Completing Your Changes:

Once you've done your task, remember to:

Make sure to re-enable SIP
 afterward by rebooting into Recovery and entering:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Reboot
 to your main system again normally.

â 
Confirm if this resolves your mount issue or if you encounter a different problem.

Here is the correct, 
clear, step-by-step
 procedure to accomplish exactly what you're trying to do. Follow these precisely:

ð Step 1: 
Boot into macOS Recovery

Shut down your Mac.

Turn it on, then immediately press and hold 
Touch ID
 (Power button) until you see "Loading startup options."

Select 
"Options"
, then click 
Continue
.

Enter your password when asked.

ð Step 2: 
Launch Terminal in Recovery

In Recovery Mode, go to 
Utilities
 â select 
Terminal
.

ð Step 2: 
Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Authenticated-root

Enter this command:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

After typing, hit 
Return
.

Confirm the command executed successfully. You should see confirmation messages.

ð Step 2a: 
Reboot the Mac (Critical Step)

Restart your Mac normally into macOS (Apple menu â Restart).

ð Step 3: 
Remount your macOS System Volume as Writable

When you're back in your regular user session (logged into your account), open Terminal and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /

Enter your password if asked.

If you get a permission error, try explicitly:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /dev/disk3s3

(Use your actual disk identifier from 
diskutil list
, e.g., 
disk3s3
.)

Now your volume should be writable.

ð§ Step 3a: 
(Optional but Recommended) Verify Writable Volume

Check by:

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 /System/testfile && 

ls

 /System

If no error appears, youâre successfully writable.

ð  Step 3: 
Implement the ChrisGeo script

Now you're ready to place or run the 
ChrisGeo AirPlay-disabling script
 directly.

(At this point, you would run the ChrisGeo script you've chosen to disable AirPlay fully. Copy/paste or run according to the script instructions.)

â ï¸ 
After youâre done: Re-enable Security Protections!

Reboot into Recovery again
 (repeat step 1 above).

Enter:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

(This re-enables SIP and security features.)

Then reboot normally.

â¡ 
You can now proceed carefully through these steps.

Confirm clearly if you encounter any issues.

You said:

I think you are missing the point that current sip is already disabled and we got the error 66

ChatGPT said:

Youâre right
âletâs clarify carefully. Since 
SIP is already disabled
 and you still received the error:

vbnet

Copy

Edit

mount_apfs:

 volume could 

not

 be mounted: Permission denied

mount:

 / failed 

with

66

This happens because even with SIP off, your root volume isn't writable yet.

You need to explicitly run the following command to disable authenticated-root and make the system volume fully writable (which is separate from standard SIP disabling):

ð 
Correct steps from your current state (SIP already off):

â 
Step 1: Reboot to Recovery again (just once)

Restart and enter 
Recovery Mode
:

Shut down your Mac completely.

Hold down the 
Power Button (Touch ID)
 until you see 
"Loading startup options"
.

Select 
Options â Continue
.

â 
Step 2: In Recovery Terminal, explicitly disable authenticated-root

Run exactly:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Confirm the message indicating itâs successfully disabled
