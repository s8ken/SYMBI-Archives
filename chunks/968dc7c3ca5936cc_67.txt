.

(Even though SIP itself is off, this step is specifically required to make macOS root volume writable.)

â 
Step 3: Reboot back into regular macOS

Restart normally.

â 
Step 4: Remount the macOS Volume as writable (this fixes the error 66):

Open Terminal in your normal session and run carefully:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /

If you still get an error here, explicitly mount your root volume with:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil list

Identify your root system volume (likely 
disk3s3
 from your earlier output) and run explicitly:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /dev/disk3s3

This step should now complete without error 66.

â 
After completing these steps
, your root volume will be writable, and you're prepared to fully implement the ChrisGeo script.

No additional restarts or extra Recovery sessions are needed until youâre ready to re-enable SIP after you finish running your script.

Let me know if you encounter any issues.

This error:

mount_apfs:

 volume could

mount:

 / failed 

with

66

indicates that 
authenticated-root
 protection is still enabled, or the volume wasn't remounted correctly.

Double-check the following steps:

Boot into Recovery Mode
 (restart and hold the power button, select 
Options
, continue).

In Recovery Terminal, explicitly run:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

While still in Recovery
, verify the status by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil status

This should clearly state:

lua

Copy

Edit

Authenticated Root 

status

: disabled

Then
, restart back into normal macOS.

After logging back into your normal session
, run again:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /

This exact procedure is requiredâdoing the authenticated-root disable in Recovery is not enough if you skip verifying or if you restart incorrectly. The error you're currently seeing (
66 Permission denied
) occurs because macOS is still enforcing the sealed system volume.

Please confirm carefully in Recovery Terminal that:

Authenticated Root
 is explicitly listed as 
disabled
 after the 
csrutil authenticated-root disable
 command.

Do this carefully and let me know the result when you come back.

Great. Now, let's carefully confirm the state after your recovery boot to ensure the root filesystem is writable.

Run exactly this in Terminal and send back the output:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /
mount
csrutil status

This will confirm:

The root filesystem is now writable (
mount
).

SIP (System Integrity Protection) and authenticated-root settings (
csrutil status
).

Once you share this output, we'll proceed clearly from there.

Your root filesystem (

sealed and read-only
, even though SIP is disabled. That's why you see the

 error.
