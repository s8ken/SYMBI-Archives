licitly disable the authenticated root
 (a separate security feature beyond SIP):

Perform these steps exactly in Recovery Mode:

Reboot into 
Recovery Mode
 again:

Shut down the Mac.

Hold down the power button until "Loading startup options" appears.

Click 
Options
, then 
Continue
.

Open 
Terminal
 from the Recovery menu bar (Utilities â Terminal).

Execute the following command exactly:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

After the command completes successfully, reboot normally:

bash

Copy

Edit

reboot

After rebooting normally:

Open Terminal and run these commands to verify the status:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil status
mount | grep 

" / "

You should see:

Authenticated Root
: disabled

System Integrity Protection
: disabled

The root filesystem (
/
) should 
no longer be sealed and read-only
 after rebooting.

Return here once you've completed these steps and verified the status above.

if I got back into recover and into terminal and type csrutil authenticated-root disable it will say its already disabled

It means macOS is currently booted from a sealed snapshot rather than the writable root volume. This usually happens when the system is still booting from the protected snapshot of the operating system, even if you disabled SIP and Authenticated Root.

Hereâs exactly what you should do next to resolve this:

Step-by-Step (one more recovery boot):

Restart your Mac again into Recovery Mode:

Shut down your Mac.

Press and hold the power button until you see âLoading startup options.â

Choose 
Options
, then click 
Continue
.

Open Terminal
 (from the top menu bar: 
Utilities â Terminal
).

Identify your macOS volume
:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil apfs list

Look carefully at the output. Identify your primary macOS volume named something like 
"Macintosh HD"
 (not "Data" or "Preboot"). Make a note of the exact 
identifier
, which is something like 
disk3s3
 (yours was previously 
disk3s3
).

Mount the volume as writable:

Use the exact disk identifier from above:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD

(Make sure to use your exact volume name above, typically 
"Macintosh HD"
.)

If it returns no error, it's successful.

If you get permission errors again, first explicitly mount the correct device:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /dev/disk3s3 /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD

(Replace 
disk3s3
 with your actual disk identifier from the previous step.)

Verify the mount succeeded
:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount | grep Macintosh

Ensure you see output showing it mounted as 
read/write
 (
rw
), not sealed or read-only.

Rebuild a writable snapshot of the volume
 (required for persistent changes):

bash

Copy

Edit

bless --folder /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot

(This step creates a new writable snapshot that macOS boots from.)

Reboot into normal mode:

bash

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting back normally:

Run these checks again in 
Terminal
 to confirm:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil status
mount | grep 

" / "

You should see:

Authenticated Root: disabled

System Integrity Protection: disabled

Volume mounted as 
read/write
 (no longer sealed)

Return here after confirming this step-by-step.

I filled the steps but it kept saying sealed 

ChatGPT said:

When you repeatedly see the "sealed" error despite following the exact steps, it typically means that macOS is still enforcing a cryptographic seal on the snapshot of the system volume.

The error you're seeing:

pgsql

mount_apfs: volume could 

not
