Your Mac is still booting from a sealed snapshot (a cryptographically signed read-only state). Even though you've disabled System Integrity Protection (
csrutil disable
) and Authenticated Root (
csrutil authenticated-root disable
), macOS is still enforcing the sealed snapshot.

To resolve the issue with the sealed snapshot and get the filesystem writable, please carefully follow these 
exact steps
. We'll do this slowly and clearly, step-by-step:

1. Boot into Recovery Mode again:

Restart your Mac.

Hold down the 
power button
 until you see "Loading startup options".

Select 
Options
, then 
Continue
.

Enter your admin credentials.

2. Open Terminal in Recovery:

From the recovery menu, select 
Utilities > Terminal
.

3. Double-check your SIP and Authenticated-root status first:

Run this command in Terminal:

lua

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

status

And then:

lua

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

status

If you see something like:

System Integrity Protection status: disabled.

Authenticated-root status: disabled.

Then proceed to step 4. If either one says "enabled," disable it with:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

then reboot back to Recovery mode again.

4. Mount your System Volume writable (remove the snapshot sealing):

Now, run these commands 
exactly as they appear
:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil list internal

Locate your 
Macintosh HD
 system volume. Typically it will be 
/dev/disk3s3
 or similar.

Then enter (replace disk identifier if different):

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

If you get an error again, you must manually mount the main volume writable by specifying the volume explicitly:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil apfs unlockVolume disk3s3
diskutil mount disk3s3
mount -uw /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD

Replace 
disk3s3
 if needed based on the diskutil output.

If this succeeds without errors, your volume is now writable.

Important check
:

Confirm with:

nginx

Copy

Edit

mount

You should 
no longer see
 the word 
sealed
 in the output for your root (
/
) volume.

STOP HERE. DO NOT PROCEED BEYOND THIS POINT YET.

Please confirm if you're successfully at this point without errors. Let me know clearly the output or any errors, and then we'll continue safely.

can we just backtrack for a moment and think about the actual outcome I am trying to achieve here

ChatGPT said:

Let's pause, reset, and clearly outline your goal, stepping back from the complexity we've reached.

Your Original Goal:

You want to 
fully and permanently disable AirPlay
 on your macOS system to ensure:

No remote access through AirPlay.

No unauthorized screen mirroring or streaming.

No unwanted processes (
AirPlayXPCHelper
, 
AirPlayUIAgent
) running.

Why We've Been Struggling:

macOS treats 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 and 
AirPlayUIAgent
 as critical system services.

These services are protected by 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 and Apple's "sealed" APFS snapshot, meaning macOS intentionally prevents users from modifying or disabling them under normal conditions.

Each attempt to disable these processes temporarily has been undone upon reboot because macOS continuously enforces system integrity.

Repeatedly disabling SIP and trying to manually remove or restrict these components has created frustration without achieving lasting results.

What We Actually Need:

A solution that reliably stops AirPlay functionality without fighting the OS directly:

Ideal Outcome:

Prevent AirPlay from activating or being usable at the OS/network level.

Leave SIP and authenticated-root intact (ideally re-enabled later).

Avoid complex filesystem hacks, as macOS may revert these changes after updates.

Practical and Reliable Alternatives:

Instead of manually deleting or disabling system services, consider these more sustainable solutions:

1. Firewall-based blocking:

Use a firewall (built-in or third-party) to explicitly block AirPlay services (
AirPlayXPCHelper
 and
