irPlayUIAgent
) from communicating over the network.

This ensures the services exist but remain completely isolated.

2. Configuration Profiles (Enterprise Approach):

macOS allows creating a Configuration Profile (
.mobileconfig
) that explicitly disables AirPlay, permanently enforcing this at the system level.

Such profiles are widely used by companies and educational institutions to block AirPlay for privacy and security.

3. Network-level blocking (Router):

Configure the network/router to block AirPlay-related traffic (usually via Bonjour/mDNS, which runs on UDP port 5353).

Very effective and low-risk.

Recommended Way Forward (Stable & Reliable):

I strongly recommend approach #2 (a 
Configuration Profile
), as it is designed precisely for what you're attempting:

â 
Configuration Profile approach (Easy and Reliable)
:

We can create a simple, signed configuration profile.

This explicitly instructs macOS: "AirPlay must remain off."

Once installed, macOS enforces the profile continuously without needing to disable SIP or alter system files.

Would you like me to guide you step-by-step through this more stable approach?

It achieves your ultimate goalâpermanently and robustly blocking AirPlayâwithout continually fighting macOS system protections.

You said:

I simply do not want my screen being shared without my permission if say I am on a zoom call or any other meeting situation.

That's exactly the clarity we needed.

Your goal isn't specifically "remove AirPlay"âyour goal is:

â 
"Prevent my Mac's screen from being shared or mirrored without explicit permission, especially during Zoom or other video calls."

This greatly simplifies the solution, because AirPlay itself isn't the root problemâthe real issue is unwanted screen sharing or recording functionality. Let's 
refocus
 clearly on practical, effective solutions:

ð Practical Steps to Stop Unauthorized Screen Sharing or Mirroring on macOS

1. Disable Screen Sharing, Remote Management, and Remote Login:

Open

System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
Sharing
.

Ensure these settings are 
OFF
:

â 
Screen Sharing

â 
Remote Management

â 
Remote Login

(You've already confirmed Remote Login is off previously.)

2. Disable AirPlay Receiver via macOS Settings:

Go to 
System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
AirDrop & Handoff
 â 
AirPlay Receiver
.

Set 
AirPlay Receiver
 to 
OFF
.

(You have attempted terminal-based solutions before, but please confirm this via GUI again.)

3. Adjust Firewall to Block AirPlay Completely:

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

This ensures macOS firewall explicitly blocks network access to AirPlay.

4. Block mDNS (Bonjour/AirPlay Protocol) at Your Router:

Log in to your router.

Block the 
UDP port 5353
 (mDNS/Bonjour), which AirPlay relies upon.

If this port is blocked, AirPlay cannot advertise or discover devices, completely preventing remote connections via AirPlay from external devices.

5. Configure Zoom and Other Apps Specifically:

Zoom:

Open Zoom â 
Settings
 â 
Screen Sharing

Set to: 
Host Only
 or fully disable as needed.

Other video-conferencing apps:

Review their settings to explicitly forbid or require consent before screen sharing or recording.

ð¨ 
Key Security Check (Already Done by You):

You've verified multiple times:

shell

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E "AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

Keep periodically checking this to confirm these processes aren't unexpectedly active.

Your Next Step (Recommended):

I strongly suggest first implementing the Firewall-based
