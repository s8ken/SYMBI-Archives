rPlay explicitly using the Firewall (to ensure it cannot communicate externally):

Run this clearly and directly (exactly as shown):

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp "/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app"
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp "/usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper"

4.
 Restart 
SystemUIServer
 to refresh the UI:

shell

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

ð¨ 
Important Reminder:

AirPlayUIAgent & AirPlayXPCHelper will always appear as processes
 because they are integral macOS components.

Your primary concern is preventing 
unauthorized external connections
, not removing system components.

The above commands securely and conclusively achieve that goal.

Please run these commands clearly once more, and then you can confidently move forward knowing you've achieved a secure environment against unauthorized screen sharing.

Great! You've successfully done the following:

Enabled macOS Firewall 
Stealth Mode
.

Explicitly blocked network communication for:

AirPlayUIAgent

AirPlayXPCHelper

Restarted 
SystemUIServer
 to ensure your system recognizes these changes immediately.

â 
Verification (Recommended):

To double-check and confirm the firewall rules took effect, you can run:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --listapps | grep -i airplay

You should see output indicating that these two processes are explicitly blocked.

ð¨ 
Why This Matters:

These steps mean 
AirPlay-related components cannot transmit your screen
 or any other data 
over the network
, even if they appear as running processes locally.

Your macOS firewall is now configured to deny outbound/inbound network activity from these components, preventing unauthorized or accidental screen sharing.

ð¡ï¸ 
Next Steps for Ongoing Security:

Regularly audit permissions (
System Settings â Privacy & Security â Screen Recording
) before attending sensitive meetings.

Keep Firewall settings active and check periodically to ensure rules haven't changed.

This configuration is robust and meets your goal of confidently preventing unauthorized screen sharing during Zoom or other video meetings.

You're all set.

Almost there! It looks like both AirPlay components have been 
added
 to the firewall's application list, but your output doesn't show if theyâre currently 
blocked
.

Let's quickly verify explicitly if they're blocked or not.

ð 
Quick Check:

Please run these two commands separately:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getappblocked "/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app"

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getappblocked "/usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper"

â 
Expected Result:

You should see output similar to:

swift

Copy

Edit

/System/

Library

/CoreServices/

AirPlayUIAgent

.app 

is

 blocked

/usr/

libexec

/

AirPlayXPCHelper

is

 blocked

ð 
If theyâre NOT blocked (e.g., "is NOT blocked"):

Run the commands again explicitly:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp "/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app"
sudo /
