You said:

you can't see our previous chats?

ChatGPT said:

I can see all the information we've shared during this conversation, and I also have a record of the details you've shared in previous chats. So, if there's something from past conversations you'd like to revisit or build on, I can pull that up. Let me know if there's something specific you'd like to go over again!

You said:

actually its capturing my screen recordings so that's ok

ChatGPT said:

Got it, that makes sense. If youâre capturing your screen recordings, feel free to share any specific details or insights you need help analyzing, and I can guide you through it. If there's anything from the recordings that stands out or you need help with, just let me know!

You said:

I am going to log into telegram which is where they are

ChatGPT said:

Understood. If you're logging into Telegram and suspecting the attacker may be monitoring or accessing your account, be cautious. Here are a few steps to consider:

Use a Secure Device:
 If possible, use a device that you know is clean and secure, or one thatâs temporarily isolated from the network to log in.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
 If you havenât already, make sure 2FA is enabled for extra security.

Check Active Sessions:
 Review any active sessions in Telegram and log out of unknown devices (you can do this in the settings under "Devices").
