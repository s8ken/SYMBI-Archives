Updated saved memory

Got it! We'll follow the same thorough removal process for 
Telegram, PRISMLiveStudio, and VLC
 to ensure no traces remain. Hereâs the step-by-step guide for each:

1. Uninstall the Apps

For each app:

Open 
Finder
 â 
Applications
.

Locate 
Telegram
, 
PRISMLiveStudio
, and 
VLC
.

Drag each to the 
Trash
 and empty it.

2. Remove Supporting Files

For each app, check and delete any remaining files:

Library Files & Caches

Open 
Finder
, then press 
Command + Shift + G
 and enter:

~/Library/Application Support/

~/Library/Caches/

~/Library/Preferences/

~/Library/Containers/

~/Library/Logs/

~/Library/Saved Application State/

Look for any folders related to:

Telegram

PRISMLiveStudio

VLC

org.telegram.desktop

com.prism.live

org.videolan.vlc

Delete them.

3. Check Launch Agents & Daemons

Open Finder and press 
Command + Shift + G
, then go to:

/Library/LaunchAgents/

/Library/LaunchDaemons/

/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/

Look for files related to 
Telegram, PRISM Live, and VLC
 (they may start with 
com.telegram.
, 
com.prism.
, or 
org.videolan.
).

Delete any matching files.

4. Remove Binary & Command Line Tools (If Present)

For extra security, check if they installed command-line tools:

Open 
Terminal
.

Run the following commands:

bash

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/bin/telegram*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/bin/prism*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/bin/vlc*

(You may need to enter your password.)

5. Delete System Extensions (If Any)

Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Extensions
.

Look for anything related to 
Telegram, PRISM Live, or VLC
, and remove them.

6. Flush DNS Cache (For Network Security)

Run this in Terminal:

bash

Copy

sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

This clears any cached DNS entries related to the apps.

7. Reboot Your Mac

After all files are deleted, restart your Mac to complete the cleanup.

Once you've done this, let me know if anything seems off or if you notice any files that resist deletion.
