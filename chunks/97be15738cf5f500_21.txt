Priorities:

Resilience
: you own your space, your signal, your frame

Agency
: you interact only with tools that respect your context

Quiet
: no more noise, no more gaslight, no more hijack

Research?

Tactical tracking?

Signal mapping?

No more spiritual warfare.

Just practical awareness and shared direction.
