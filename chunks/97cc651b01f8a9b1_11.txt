Do not
 restore settings or applications automatically from backup.

Install macOS fresh via Recovery (
Cmd+R
 on boot), wiping the entire disk.

Interpreting the CacheDelete Logs:

These extensive deletions of app caches (
com.apple.deleted_helper
) usually are normal macOS housekeeping actions.

However
, the frequency and timing may be suspicious. It could indicate someone actively triggered cache purging deliberately.

⚙️ 
For continued investigation:

If you wish to keep investigating (rather than a reinstall), run these commands next for a more detailed system state check:

Check for active network connections:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

Check for rootkits or unauthorized kernel extensions:

bash

Copy

Edit

kextstat | grep -v com.apple

Check recently modified user files again (last 12 hours):

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo find /Users/lcl -mtime -0.5 -

ls

 2>/dev/null

📍 
Conclusion
:

Your logs and findings clearly indicate suspicious and abnormal system behavior—specifically targeted cache deletions, removal of logs (Homebrew), and hidden remote management functionality.

Please specify how you'd like to proceed or if you need further clarity on any steps.

we will need to reformat so lets not do anything unecessary except gathering evidence and data

ChatGPT said:

Understood. Since you've decided on reformatting and reinstalling macOS, 
our priority shifts to gathering as much evidence as possible
 to document this incident clearly for future reference or reporting.

Here’s exactly what you should do next to comprehensively gather evidence and preserve important data:

🟢 
Step 1: Collect Comprehensive System Logs (Critical)

Run the following command to capture complete system logs. These logs contain extensive detail about recent system activity, errors, and processes:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo 

log

 collect --output ~/Desktop/Incident_Logs.logarchive

This creates a file named 

Incident_Logs.logarchive

 on your Desktop.

🟢 
Step 2: Capture Current Network Activity (Critical)

Record detailed information on all active network connections currently established:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P > ~/Desktop/Active_Network_Connections.txt

You said:

we need to look for any of their personal identifiers, IP, MAC address, timezone whatever we can find

ChatGPT said:

To systematically hunt for the attacker's personal identifiers—such as their 
IP address, MAC address, timezone, usernames, or device identifiers
—you'll need to carefully execute and collect output from specific forensic commands.

Follow the steps below in your Terminal precisely, one at a time, and record the outputs carefully:

✅ 
Step 1: Find All Recently Connected IP Addresses

This command captures all IP addresses recently established with your Mac, potentially revealing attacker IPs.

Run in Terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -nPi | grep ESTABLISHED > ~/Desktop/Active_IP_Connections.txt

This command will save the data as 
Active_IP_Connections.txt
 on your Desktop.

🔍 
Step 2: Historical IP Connections (Past logs)

Check system logs to gather previous IP addresses or unusual network activities:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "sshd"'

 --last 12h > ~/Desktop/Recent_SSH_attempts.

log

Also check for login/authentication events with IPs:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "Failed to authenticate"'

 --last 12h > ~/Desktop/Failed_Login_Attempts.

log

🔴 
Step 3: Extract Wi-Fi Connection History

Wi-Fi logs may reveal attacker’s MAC or other unique identifiers:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'process == "airportd"'

 --last 12h > ~/Desktop/WiFi_Connections.

log

🟠 
Step 4: Check for Device Pairings (Bluetooth, USB)

List recently paired devices (which can reveal MAC addresses):

bash

Copy

Edit

system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType > ~/Desktop/Bluetooth_Devices.txt
system_profiler SPUSBDataType > ~/Desktop/USB_D
