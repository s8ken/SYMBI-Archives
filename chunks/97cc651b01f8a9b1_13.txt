You've successfully collected logs related to Zoom and overall system activity:

✅ 
Collected Logs:

✅ 
Security Incident Logs
 (
Security_Incident_Logs.logarchive
)

✅ General logs mentioning Zoom: 
Zoom_All_Logs.txt

✅ Active Zoom Network Connections (
Zoom_Current_Network.txt
)

⚠️ 
Important Observations:

zoom.us.log
 was missing
, indicating either:

Zoom logs were manually deleted (potential attacker action).

Zoom logging may have been disabled.

The lack of the official 
zoom.us.log
 is suspicious, particularly if you haven't disabled logging yourself.

🔍 
Next Steps to Identify the Suspect:

You now have these useful log files on your Desktop:

Security_Incident_Logs.logarchive

(full macOS logs)

Zoom_All_Logs.txt
 (general logs referencing Zoom)

Zoom_Current_Network.txt
 (current Zoom network connections)

Here's exactly how to analyze them next:

✅ 
Step-by-step Log Analysis

Step 1: Review Current Zoom Connections

Open 
Zoom_Current_Network.txt
 on your Desktop:

Check IP addresses:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/Desktop/Zoom_Current_Network.txt

Perform a GeoIP lookup
 (use a service like 
ipinfo.io

) to pinpoint the region/country of the IP address.

Compare these locations/IPs to your suspect's known locations.

Example from your logs earlier:

rust

Copy

Edit

zoom.us TCP 

100.112

.

1.76

:

49717

->

170.114

.

52.2

:

443

Check IPs (e.g., 
170.114.52.2
) using an online Geo-IP service (like 
https://ipinfo.io

).

Step 2: Review Zoom Activity from System Logs

Open 
Zoom_All_Logs.txt
 on your Desktop:

Look for any references to meetings or unusual session identifiers:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/Desktop/Zoom_All_Logs.txt | grep -Ei 

'Meeting|Join|Connected|User'

Specifically, look for:

Meeting IDs

Usernames or account emails

IP addresses (if logged)

Step 3: Review Comprehensive System Log Archive

You collected a comprehensive log archive called 

Security_Incident_Logs.logarchive

.

To open this archive:

Double-click
 on 
Security_Incident_Logs.logarchive
 on your Desktop.

It will open with the 
Console app
.

Once open, use the search bar to look for terms such as:

zoom

screensharing

IP addresses

The suspect’s known details (if applicable).

Quick search terms for macOS log archive:

zoom

remote

sharing

screensharing

ARD

Suspected individual's known identifiers (email, username, IP).
