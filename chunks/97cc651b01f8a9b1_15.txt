❗️ 
SJA

Unusual
 – Potentially unauthorized unless you explicitly created it. ⚠️ 
(Suspicious)

🚨 
Immediate Next Steps:

You have an unknown user account called 
SJA
. This user account stands out as suspicious unless you explicitly recognize and authorized it.

Check the details of the suspicious account ("SJA"):

Run this command to display comprehensive details of the account:

bash

Copy

Edit

dscl . 

read

 /Users/SJA

Specifically look for:

Date of creation

Home directory path

Login shell

Account privileges

Check last login activity of all users:

To find recent logins and activities:

bash

Copy

Edit

last | grep SJA

Recommended Immediate Action:

If "SJA" was NOT created by you
 (and you don’t recognize it), it is likely 
attacker-created
.

Before deleting, collect detailed evidence:

bash

Copy

Edit

dscl . 

read

 /Users/SJA > ~/Desktop/SJA_account_info.txt
sudo 

ls

 -la /Users/SJA >> ~/Desktop/SJA_account_info.txt

Save this evidence file 
SJA_account_info.txt
 securely.

After Evidence Collection:

You can safely disable and remove the suspicious account:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . delete /Users/SJA
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Users/SJA

(Only after evidence gathering is complete.)

⚠️ 
Important
:

Given your plan for a complete reformat, ensure you save all evidence and document these findings for later reporting or forensic analysis.

Let me know the result of the details (
dscl . read /Users/SJA
) or if you need help interpreting the output.

Good to know! Since 
SJA
 is your own account, there’s no unexpected unauthorized user account on your system. That’s a relief.

Next Steps: Double-Check for Any Changes to User Privileges

Even though no unknown accounts exist, an attacker 
may have modified user privileges
 or 
enabled hidden users
 for persistence. Let’s verify everything is intact.

✅ 
Step 1: Check for Any Hidden User Accounts

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . -list /Users IsHidden

If any account returns 
IsHidden = 1
, that means it's hidden from macOS login screens.

✅ 
Step 2: Check User Privileges & Admin Status

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

This will list all users who currently have 
admin privileges
. Make sure 
only
 your authorized users (
lcl
 and 
SJA
) are there.

If an unknown user appears in the admin list, remove them with:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/admin GroupMembership <username>

✅ 
Step 3: Check If Root Account is Enabled (It Should Be Disabled)

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

dsenableroot -s

If it responds 
"root is enabled"
, disable it immediately:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dsenableroot -d

✅ 
Step 4: Check for Login Hooks (Malicious Logins)

Attackers sometimes install 
login hooks
 that execute scripts when you log in.

Check for active login hooks:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow

Look for any 
LoginHook
 or 
LogoutHook
 entries. If present and suspicious, remove them with:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo defaults delete /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
sudo defaults delete /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook

Conclusion:

If everything checks out fine, your user accounts are likely untouched. Let me know if you find 
any hidden accounts, unknown admins, or active login hooks
—I’ll help you clean them up. 🚀
