Reviewing the logs you've provided, here's a detailed assessment:

Key Findings from Your Terminal Session:

1. Homebrew Completely Missing

brew
 is not found in your system (
command not found
).

Standard directories (
/opt/homebrew
, 
/usr/local/Cellar
) do not exist.

No logs exist in 
~/Library/Logs/Homebrew/
.

This indicates Homebrew was either:

Never installed
 (unlikely given previous commands), or

Removed completely
 (possibly maliciously), or

Disabled or hidden
 deliberately by an attacker.

Given your previous attempts (
brew list
, 
brew services list
) clearly indicate you expected Homebrew installed, its disappearance strongly suggests deliberate intervention.

2. Crontab:

crontab -l
 showed 
no scheduled tasks
. That’s good—no persistent malicious cron-based jobs detected for your user (
lcl
).

2. Homebrew directories not found:

pgsql

Copy

Edit

/opt/homebrew/Cellar: 

No

 such file 

or

 directory
/usr/

local

/Cellar: 

No

 such file 

or

 directory

These directories would exist if Homebrew was normally installed. Their absence indicates a thorough removal.

3. Homebrew-related logs:

perl
