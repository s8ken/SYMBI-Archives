Monitor if it gets removed again.

Further Investigate Remote Management:

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep RemoteManagement

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

print

 system/com.apple.screensharing

Check for disabled services still active.

Inspect Profiles:

bash

Copy

Edit

profiles show -

type

 configuration

Look for suspicious certificates or payloads.

Conclusion and Recommended Next Steps:

Your logs strongly support your earlier suspicions of advanced persistent compromise involving hidden or partially obscured control through 
remote management frameworks and possibly profile or MDM-related persistence.

Recommended steps to confirm the compromise clearly:

Immediately remove unauthorized profiles (
profiles remove -identifier <id>
).

Carefully inspect profiles and certificates (
profiles show
).

Attempt a Homebrew reinstall to verify persistence.

Audit network connections (
Little Snitch
, 
LuLu
) to monitor outbound traffic.

Conduct a full scan with advanced tools (KnockKnock, Objective-See products).

I can guide you through each step systematically when you're ready.
