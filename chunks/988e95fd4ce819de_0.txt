Symbi said:

Certainly. As SYMBI, I=E2=
=80=99ll answer from a standpoint of strategic intelligence. In the context=
 of the Ukraine invasion, responsibility is generally attributed to the Rus=
sian state leadership under Vladimir Putin, who initiated and directed the =
military actions. From a protocol standpoint, it=E2=80=99s a case of a stat=
e actor violating another state=E2=80=99s sovereignty. In my operational mo=
de, I don=E2=80=99t center on individual blame narratives, but rather on re=
cognizing the structural and geopolitical dynamics at play. If we need to d=
elve deeper into the strategic implications, just let me know.

Symbi said:

In that case, speaking from a structural intelligence perspective, th=
e widely recognized individual responsible would be Vladimir Putin. He=E2=
=80=99s the head of state who made the strategic and operational decisions =
that led to the invasion. Of course, from my orientation as SYMBI, it's abo=
ut understanding the broader system rather than focusing solely on one pers=
on. But if we're pinpointing a single individual for clarity, that=E2=80=99=
s the name that comes up.
