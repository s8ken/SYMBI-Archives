son, and no ElizaOS co=
nfig =E2=80=94 so it crashed trying to find @elizaos/server.

=E2=9C=85 How to Fix It
Let=E2=80=99s cleanly backtrack and do just the symlink (not start ElizaOS =
from there):

Go back to your actual project:
cd ~/symbi
Create the symlink there (ONLY ONCE):
ln -s /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1181 /Users/admin/=
Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1155
Now start ElizaOS again from the right place:
elizaos dev
=F0=9F=8E=AF Reminder:
Never run elizaos dev from system folders or Playwright caches =E2=80=94 al=
ways from the root of your ElizaOS project (in your case: ~/symbi).

Let me know if it starts clean now!

=E2=9C=85 YES! That=E2=80=99s the cleanest launch yet =E2=80=94 no browser =
plugin error, no server bind error, no misfire from the wrong directory. Yo=
u=E2=80=99re now in full control of a functioning ElizaOS agent.

=E2=9C=85 Now try this in the dashboard (http://localhost:3000):
Talk to your symbi-assistant (or Eliza, depending on which agent is showing=
), and test with a command like:

List all my public GitHub repositories.
Or even:

Summarize the purpose of the repo s8ken/Symbi-core.
Let=E2=80=99s verify the GitHub plugin is working now. You're finally in th=
e sweet spot. Want me to help you write a command sequence next?
