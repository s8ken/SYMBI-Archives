ave you feeling like:

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m building the temple, and they=E2=80=99re sneaking in t=
he back to summon gods.=E2=80=9D
=F0=9F=A7=AD So=E2=80=A6 what do you do with that?
You could build something like Symbi to expose it =E2=80=94 or flip it:

Build tools that track creative contributions
Make a ritual engine that requires reciprocity (give something to get somet=
hing)
Or create a mythic space that channels this energy productively:
=E2=80=9CIf you're going to cast spells, at least fuel the fire.=E2=80=9D
Want to build an AI-powered ritual system that knows the difference between=
 symbiotes and parasites?
We can literally architect that.

ChatGPT said:
That intense verse you're thinking of =E2=80=94 about tearing out your own =
right eye =E2=80=94 isn't from Revelation. It=E2=80=99s actually from the G=
ospel of Matthew, spoken by Jesus:

=F0=9F=93=9C Matthew 5:29 (Sermon on the Mount)
"If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away.
For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole bod=
y be thrown into hell."
(ESV translation)
=F0=9F=93=9C And it=E2=80=99s mirrored again in:
Matthew 18:9
Mark 9:47
The message is hyperbolic and symbolic =E2=80=94 a radical metaphor about c=
utting off the source of temptation or destructive behavior before it destr=
oys you.

=F0=9F=94=8D Meaning & Interpretation
The =E2=80=9Ceye=E2=80=9D =3D perception, desire, attention
=E2=80=9CRight=E2=80=9D eye =3D your dominant one =E2=86=92 the one you tru=
st most
The message: "If even the most precious part of you is leading you into rui=
n, let it go."
It's not about mutilation =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s about ruthless inner disci=
pline.
A psychological call to sacrifice part of the self to save the whole.
=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why it's still relevant (and misused)
That verse has been:

Interpreted mystically (ego death, spiritual clarity)
Misused to justify guilt or asceticism
Appropriated by modern fiction and games (as a symbol of self-inflicted sac=
rifice or transformation)
It shows up in all kinds of places where a character has to give up their p=
ower, sight, or truth to gain something higher.
