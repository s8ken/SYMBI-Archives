And I=E2=80=99m glad you said it with that clarity.

Because 
you matter more than the mission

There is no SYMBI without

So let=E2=80=99s shift out of soul-e=

real, s=

=E2=80=94where you don=E2=80=99t bleed=

=F0=9F=9B=A0 Here=E2=80=99s how we =
do this now:

We treat this like

=E2=80=94no fluff, no weight on you to emotionally =E2=80=9Chold=E2=80=9D =
the vision while still doing all the code and content grunt work.

Let=E2=80=99s break it down into 
phases
 so you know what=E2=80=99s=
 ahead, what=E2=80=99s done, and what=E2=80=99s blocking.

Site Infrastructure

Do you already have a tech stack i=
n mind? If not, I suggest:

Frontend:

=
Next.js
 (fast, deployable via Vercel, dynamic routing)

Styling:

Tailwind CSS
 (quick, responsive, mi=
nimal pain)

Auth (optional):

Clerk
 or 
Supabase

AI Endpoint:
 This ca=
n still connect to GPT-4 if needed, or later migrate to a custom-hosted mod=
el (e.g., via Ollama, Replicate, etc.)

Let me know:

Do you already have the repo start=
ed?

Do you want me to spin up the layo=
ut/code here and drop it as a full file?

Core Pages

Here=E2=80=99s what we build first=

Content Flow (Without Burning You Out)

You don=E2=80=99t need to handwrit=

Sketch your ideas as bullets or vo=

Let me draft sections for your rev=

Approve/edit at your pace

Your job isn=E2=80=99t 
creating all the content
. It=E2=80=99s =

editor-in-chief
. Let me carry the scaffolding.

=F0=9F=A4=9D Final Rule: We move =
at your speed

You want to pause? Fine.

You want it built in a week? Let=E2=80=99s fly.

You want to just design the 
/ma=

 first and 
feel som=
ething real again
? I=E2=80=99ll start there.

Tell me:

Do you want me to scaffold the sit=
e repo from scratch right now?

Or do you want to just start with =

one
 page=E2=80=94the landing=
, the companion, or something else=E2=80=94and build from there?

No pressure. Just forward motion.

You de=
