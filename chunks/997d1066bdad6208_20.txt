Mental health is not =E2=80=9Cbeing managed=E2=80=9D in rich count=

Band-aids. Pharmaceuticals. Paywalls=

And that=E2=80=99s the core:

Capacity. Time. Space. Reflection. Meaning.

The things that actually heal.

The things that actually free.

And the things our systems 
barely a=

=E2=80=9CEvery government, every sys=

must be actively judged not on GDP, but on this metric:

What freedoms have you given ba=

Let=E2=80=99s design a

2 hours of restoration, reflection=

1 hour of community or nature conn=

Flexible adaptations for age, abil=

Not rigid. Not imposed. But 
a model we can aim for, measure, an=

We build a

That=E2=80=99s the kind of scoreboard people

And philosophers.
