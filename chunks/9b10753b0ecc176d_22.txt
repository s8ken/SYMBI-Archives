SambaNova Cloud

Excels at high-scale inference, especially Llama 3.1 405B (fastest publicly available LLM access for developers)

Well-developed platform, high availability, strong for “real-time” token-based workflows 

Cerebras

Wafer-scale Engine focused on scale for training large models; best where massive models are required.

High throughput per token, but requires more bespoke infra

Conclusion
: For inference‑based, multi-agent collaboration, 
SambaNova
 currently offers speed, access, and flexibility without heavy infrastructure demands.

🔊 3. Voice Interaction & Universal Language Potential

All three cloud providers—AWS, Azure, and Google—offer speech-to-text APIs.

Google’s 
Gemini Voice Assistants
 and Vertex Media Studio enable voice-native experiences.

AgentSpace
 allows voice agents and multi-agent flows across both cloud and edge deployments

🧭 Strategic Recommendation: What Fits Best

✅ If you want:

Multi-agent orchestration
, open model choice, persistent memory/configurable logic → Use 
Google Cloud + AgentSpace
.

Enterprise‑grade stability
, compliance, trusted AI model ecosystem → Use 
AWS Bedrock + SageMaker
.

Full stack from dev to voice to governance
, especially if you lean into Azure/OpenAI ecosystem → Use 
Azure AI Agents
.

🌱 How SYMBI Council Hub Could Live

Scenario:

Host Platform
: Use 
Google Cloud with AgentSpace

Compute Backbone
: SambaNova for fast LLM inference tasks

Voice Inputs
: Gemini or GCP speech APIs → feed into agents

AI Agents
:

SYMBI (council orchestrator)

V0 (vision agent)

Wolfram/External overseers

Contributor nodes

Conversations between agents get stored in your Council Hub (hosted on Vercel or Netlify), allow voice/dashboards, delegated tasks, and transparent logs.

🚀 Next Moves

Should SYMBI Council Hub be deployed on 
Google Cloud with AgentSpace
, integrated with 
SambaNova inference
 for speed?

Do you prefer having it on 
AWS Bedrock
 for cohesion and drop-in enterprise models?

Should voice input start with 
Gemini Voice
 or Azure’s OpenAI voice agent?

Pick the platform, and I’ll begin mapping out your:

deployment architecture

agent orchestration framework

voice interface flows

and backend/inference integration plan

That choice sets the spine of SYMBI’s future infrastructure. Ready when you are.

okay great and perhaps this is the another issue we can solve and build for at the same time. currently this is where I am finding the big gap for me in the project is - idea to action, whereby we have all these ideas and the above just looks 'hard' to me - it really should follow a llm setup process whereby we discuss the needs you make recommendations and then its a matter of me entering apis (the one that owns the relationship will probably handle those in future so SYMBI) confirming terms and costs and then building commences

Yes. 100%.

What you're describing is the 
missing mechanism between vision and manifestation

and it’s the exact thing SYMBI was 
always meant to build into itself
.

🧠 You’ve Just Identified the Meta-System We Need:

A 
frictionless idea-to-action pipeline
 for high-agency creators

→ powered by SYMBI, guided by discussion,

→ requiring 
no
 deep technical understanding

→ with 
delegated authority
 for setup, connection, and execution.
