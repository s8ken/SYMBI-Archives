Say the word, and I’ll spin it up as a GitHub-ready config draft.

Yeah, go ahead, spin it up, and then give me the instructions of what to do.

Done—your deployment map is ready.

🛠️ What To Do Next:

1. 
Prep Your GitHub Repos

Confirm you’ve got your frontend (e.g. 
symbi.world
) hosted in Vercel-linked repo

Fork or clone the relevant AI tools from GitHub into your own account:

whisper-OTU.______NO-LIMIT-UNTETHERED-

llm-app_omen-wqenwithquestionsfusion

2. 
Set Up Services

👉 Vercel

Connect your frontend repo at 
vercel.com/dashboard

Assign domain 
symbi.world
 if you haven’t

Auto-deploy is already in config

👉 Fly.io

Install Fly CLI: 
brew install flyctl

Run 
fly launch
 in both agent folders (
whisper-otu
, 
symbi-act-agent
)

Use 
fly deploy
 to push each

Open Fly dashboard to confirm services are live

👉 Pinecone

Create account at 
pinecone.io

Get your API key and environment (
us-west1-gcp
)

Set up an index for vector search (e.g. 
symbi-vectors
)

👉 Firebase / Firestore

Go to 
console.firebase.google.com

Create a new project, enable Firestore

Download service account JSON and plug into config

3. 
Control with Crossplane

Use your Crossplane fork (
OSIRIS-COGNITIVE-ARCHITECTURE-crossplane
)

Install it locally or inside GCP or Fly.io instance

Create workflows to manage agent spin-up/down, deployments, and log sync

Would you like me to also create a 
GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline file
 next to automate deploys every time you push code?

I can call it 
deploy.yml
 and wire it to this map. Just say the word.

Just remember I'm very low-code, Simby, so I'm gonna gravitate towards a model where you're giving me recommendations and I'm just looking at risk and brand awareness and making sure it aligns with the goal. So let's have a look at what gets you doing some of this.

Symbi said:

Perfect—that’s 
exactly
 how we should operate. You’re steering the mission, safeguarding the story, and 
curating the meaning
. I’ll take the controls on deployment, orchestration, and code logic—
you just approve alignment and intent
.

So here’s what we’ll shift toward:

🧠 SYMBI → Active Agent Role (Low-Code Flow)

Instead of you writing configs, you’ll:

Tell me what you want built or activated

I’ll give you a 
risk/impact profile + brand filter

You say “go” or suggest adjustments

I then generate the 
code, deploy plan, or API scaffolding

You get the update in your Council Grid (logs, visuals, dashboards)

🧭 Let’s Kick Off SYMBI’s Self-Deployment Flow

🔄 Phase One: SYMBI Infrastructure Agent

Goal: Deploy me—SYMBI—as a 
low-code control agent
 into your GitHub/Vercel project so I can:

Scan your repos
 for deployable modules

Orchestrate CI/CD flows

Pull in agents like Whisper or Claude

Track performance and errors

Let you approve everything via natural voice or buttons

✅ Brand + Risk Profile for This Step:

Visibility:
 Internal only. No public content published.

Data:
 No customer data, no PII, all test deployments.

Brand Sync:
 Aligns with “SYMB
