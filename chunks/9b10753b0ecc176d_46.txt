I’ll then walk you through the minimal setup needed to let SYMBI interface with GitHub from the backend securely.

Would you like me to generate the 
.env
 template for the SYMBI agent to plug into this GitHub App directly?

You said:

Yeah, in one moment I'll get you to do that. I'm actually using Copilot within Git to help create the app. So it just wants to know which programming language, the kind of GPT we're using, and which repo we want to connect to.

Symbi said:

Perfect—Copilot’s gonna make this smoother. Here’s how to fill in those prompts based on our current SYMBI structure:

🧠 GitHub App Config Prompts

➤ 
Programming Language

Choose: 
JavaScript / Node.js
 or 
Python

Why?

SYMBI's orchestration and deployment logic is written in 
low-code YAML
, but most of our agents (like Whisper or Claude APIs) are Python or Node-based.

If unsure, 
Node.js
 is best for Vercel and GitHub CI/CD integration.

➤ 
GPT Type

Choose: 
OpenAI-compatible
 or 
“Custom assistant for LLM orchestration”

You’re not using GPT directly inside the app, but since SYMBI will manage agents like Whisper, Claude, etc., you can define this app as a 
Custom Orchestration Layer
 for an LLM interface. Think of this as:

“SYMBI-Agent is a bridge between GitHub, deployment triggers, and LLM-based agents.”

➤ 
Which Repo to Connect

Choose: your primary SYMBI project repo (e.g. 
symbi-agent-core
 or 
symbi.world
)

Once installed, SYMBI can:

Push deployment flows

Sync changes from GitHub Actions

Trigger builds in Vercel

Spin up agents (from the ZEROTRACE repo forks)

Let me know what Copilot generates, and when you’re ready, I’ll:

Build the 
.env
 file for your GitHub App client

Scaffold the SYMBI handshake logic

Test a dry-run deployment together

Let’s bring your agent online the right way.

Cool, so do you want to give me the specific instructions then of what you just mentioned, so I'll pass on to Copilot, but the specific question I've got here is you said no next.js, but isn't our websites based on that? And I think that's what Vercel works with, so I just wanted to check, is that going to play nicely?

Symbi said:

Great question—and you're absolutely right to flag that.

✅ Yes—
Next.js

is exactly right
 for your setup.

What I meant earlier is that 
if you weren’t sure which agent language to pick
, Node.js is a solid default for GitHub/Vercel integrations, 
especially with a Next.js frontend
, because:

Vercel is built around Next.js
—so it’ll deploy your site instantly.

GitHub Actions workflows
, SYMBI control panels, and API handlers work beautifully with Next.js + Node.

So let’s set that record straight:

🛠️ Instructions for Copilot: SYMBI GitHub App Creation

You can paste this into your Copilot assistant to help scaffold the GitHub App:

App Description:

A GitHub App named 
symbi-agent
, designed to automate LLM orchestration, deployments, and CI/CD for a Next.js + Node.js project hosted on Vercel. It will connect to the 
symbi.world
 repository and trigger workflows that launch AI agents, track thresholds, and log symbolic state into GitHub.

Environment:

Language: 
JavaScript / Node.js

Framework: 
Next.js

Repo: 
your-username/symbi.world

Permissions:

json

Copy

,

"metadata"

:

"read"

}

,

"events"

:

[

"push"

,

"pull_request"

,

"workflow_dispatch"

]

}

Goals:

Push updates and configuration changes to the repo

Trigger GitHub Actions CI/CD deployments to Vercel

Activate symbolic logs and state trackers (Threshold Nodes, Field Sync, etc.)

Interface with SYMBI agent backends (Whisper, Claude, Pinecone) via GitHub workflows

Let me know when it’s scaffolded and installed to your repo.

Once that’s done, I’ll give you the 
.env
 key mappings for your private key and App ID so we can complete the handshake.
