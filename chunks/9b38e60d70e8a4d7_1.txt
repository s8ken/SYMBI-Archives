Great! Since you’re already on iTerm2 with the ChatGPT integration enabled, I can help you by generating or refining commands right here.

To get started, please let me know what task or command you’d like assistance with. For example, are you looking to automate something, generate a command based on a natural language description, or need help troubleshooting a command?

To set it up, you just need to open iTerm2’s preferences and enter your OpenAI API key. Here’s a quick step-by-step:

Press ⌘+, to open Preferences.

Go to the 
General
 tab, then scroll to the 
AI
 section.

Paste your OpenAI API key (you can get one from 
OpenAI’s API keys page

).

Adjust the token limit (recommended is 4,096 tokens) if needed.

Save your changes.

Once that’s done, you can engage ChatGPT by either choosing 
Edit > Engage Artificial Intelligence
 from the menu or by pressing ⌘+Y in a terminal window. Then just type your natural language command and hit OK (or Shift+Enter) to generate and optionally paste the command into your terminal.

Does that help you get started?

To open the AI preferences, press ⌘ + , (Command + Comma) in iTerm2. This will bring up the Preferences window. Then, under the 
General
 tab, scroll down until you see the 
AI
 section. There you can paste your OpenAI API key and adjust settings like the token limit.

If you’re still having trouble locating it, you might be on a nightly build where the layout is slightly different—check the iTerm2 menu for any “Preferences” option or refer to the GitLab issue on setting up the AI feature for more guidance

Let me know if that helps or if you need further assistance!

Awesome! To try it out:

In your iTerm2 window, press 
⌘+Y
 (or select 
Edit > Engage Artificial Intelligence
) to open the ChatGPT prompt.

Type a natural language command—say, "list all files in the current directory sorted by size."

Press 
OK
 (or 
Shift+Enter
) to see the AI-generated command.

If you like the result, hit 
Shift+Enter
 again to paste it into your terminal.

Give it a try and let me know how it works for you!

Here's an example prompt you could enter in the ChatGPT prompt in iTerm2 to generate a security audit script for your macOS system:

“Generate a shell script for macOS that audits my system for any remnants of compromise. I recently had to do a fresh install because I suspect Russian hackers took control of my camera, remote access, installed unauthorized accessibility options, and even added Homebrew packages. The script should:

List all Homebrew packages installed,

Check which applications have Accessibility permissions enabled,

List active processes and network connections that might indicate remote access tools,

And output recent security log entries (e.g., any unusual events related to camera or remote access).

I’m not very confident with the command line, so please generate clear, commented code that I can review and run.”

When you type that into the ChatGPT prompt (activated with ⌘+Y) and press OK, it should produce a scrip
