Based on what you’ve shared and to fully lock down remote control at the system root level, here’s a comprehensive checklist:

Disable All Remote Sharing Services:

• Open 
System Settings/Preferences
 manually and, in the Sharing section, uncheck (or turn off) services such as:

  – 
Remote Login (SSH)

  – 
Remote Management

  – 
Screen Sharing

  – 
File Sharing

Since AppleScript-based automation may fail on newer macOS versions, it’s best to verify these settings manually.

Disable SSH Completely:

• Run in Terminal:

zsh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

• Optionally, to further prevent SSH from launching at boot, unload its launch daemon:

zsh

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

(Note: On recent macOS versions, this file may be managed by the system, so manual verification in System Settings is recommended.)

Lock Down the Firewall:

• Open 
System Settings/Preferences → Network → Firewall
.

• Enable the firewall and, in its options, select 
"Block all incoming connections"
.

This helps ensure that no unsolicited network connections can be made to your machine.

Audit and Remove Remote Access Tools:

• Check for and uninstall any third-party remote access apps (such as TeamViewer or LogMeIn) that you do not use.

• Review folders like 
/Library/LaunchAgents
, 
/Library/LaunchDaemons
, and 
~/Library/LaunchAgents
 for any entries that might allow remote control, and remove any suspicious or unwanted items.

Verify SIP (System Integrity Protection):

• Run:

zsh

Copy

csrutil status

It should confirm that SIP is enabled, which helps prevent unauthorized modifications to system files.

Review Open Network Ports:

• Use:

zsh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n -P

Review the output to ensure that only expected system processes (like mDNSResponder, system daemons, etc.) are listening on network ports.

By following these steps, you ensure that your Mac’s remote access points are disabled at the system level and that the file system remains as it should be for a fresh install.

Let me know if you’d like additional details or further assistance with any of these steps!

Do you really want to turn remote login off? If you do, you will lose this connection and can only turn it back on locally at the server (yes/no)? yes
setremotelogin: remote login is already Off.
sja@SJAs-MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

Unload failed: 5: Input/output error
Try running 
launchctl bootout
 as root for richer errors.
