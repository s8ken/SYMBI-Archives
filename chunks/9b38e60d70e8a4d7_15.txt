Based on the output you provided, everything in the lsof listing appears consistent with standard macOS system processes and services. For example:

airportd, mDNSResponder, wifip2pd, and netbiosd
 are all expected for managing wireless, Bonjour services, and basic network discovery.

rapportd
 (which listens on TCP port 49153) is a known system service related to device pairing and remote configuration.

ControlCe
 is showing up on ports 7000 and 5000; these are typically associated with built-in system controls (and may relate to aspects of the Control Center on macOS).

sharingd
 is responsible for various sharing functions.

Other UDP listings (such as for mDNSResponder and wifip2pd) are normal.

Since SIP is enabled and remote login is confirmed as off, there is no immediate evidence of unauthorized remote access based on this network activity.

If you want to be extra cautious, consider running additional network monitoring tools (like Little Snitch or LuLu) to detect any unexpected outbound connections over time.

Here’s a list of free tools you can use to further lock down and audit your macOS system:

LuLu
 – A free, open-source firewall by Objective-See that monitors and blocks unauthorized outgoing network connections.

KnockKnock
 – Scans your system for persistent software (launch agents, daemons, etc.) that may have been installed without your knowledge.

BlockBlock
 – Continuously monitors your system for any new persistent items trying to install themselves.

OverSight
 – Monitors your Mac’s webcam and microphone to alert you when they are activated unexpectedly.

OSQuery
 – An open-source tool that lets you query your system’s information (much like a SQL database) to help detect anomalies.

Wireshark
 – A powerful network protocol analyzer to monitor all network traffic and check for unusual activity.

ClamAV
 – An open-source antivirus engine you can run via the command line to scan for malware.

EtreCheck
 – Generates a detailed diagnostic report about your system’s health and configuration (free or donationware).

Each of these tools can help you verify that your system is in a secure, fresh state and monitor for any unauthorized activity.

For more details on some of these, check out resources from Objective-See and the OSQuery and Wireshark project pages.

okay so another thing that did was to alter all the accessibility options such as braille options, command and voice options, zoom options etc...

To restore your system’s accessibility settings to their default state and remove any unwanted alterations, here are some steps you can follow:

Manually Review in System Settings:

• Open 
System Settings/Preferences → Accessibility
 and review each category (e.g., VoiceOver, Zoom, Display, Braille, etc.).

• Revert any settings that were changed without your consent.

Reset via Terminal (Universal Access):

You can reset many accessibility preferences by removing the associated preferences file. For example, running the following command in Terminal will delete your universal access settings (they’ll be recreated at default upon reboot):

zsh

Copy

defaults delete com.apple.universalaccess

After executing this command, log out and log back in (or restart your Mac) to see the changes take effect.

Revoke Unauthorized Accessibility Permissions:

• Go to 
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
.

• Remove
