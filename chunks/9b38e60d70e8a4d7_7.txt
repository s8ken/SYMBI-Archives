 that SIP is active:

zsh

Copy

csrutil status

You should see a confirmation like “System Integrity Protection status: enabled.”

Overall, aside from the missing Homebrew command (which suggests Homebrew isn’t installed on your fresh system), nothing in your file structure looks suspicious.

Does this align with what you were expecting?

To effectively lock down remote access on your Mac at the system level, follow these steps:

Disable Remote Sharing Services:

• Open 
System Preferences
 → 
Sharing
 and uncheck any options you don’t need, such as:

  – 
Remote Login
 (SSH)

  – 
Remote Management

  – 
Screen Sharing

  – 
File Sharing

This stops macOS services that allow remote control.

Disable SSH Access:

Open Terminal and run:

zsh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

For an extra measure, unload the SSH daemon:

zsh

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

This ensures that SSH won’t start even after a reboot.

Secure Your Firewall:

• Go to 
System Preferences
 → 
Security & Privacy
 → 
Firewall
.

• Turn on the firewall, then click 
Firewall Options…
 and check 
Block all incoming connections
.

This prevents unsolicited network connections.

Review Remote Control Apps & Profiles:

• Uninstall or disable any third-party remote access applications (e.g., TeamViewer, LogMeIn).

• Open 
System Preferences
 → 
Profiles
 (if present) and remove any configuration profiles that grant remote access privileges.

Audit Open Network Ports:

Run the following command in Terminal to list network services:

zsh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n -P

Review the output for any unexpected listening services.

By completing these steps, you’ll have closed the standard avenues for remote control on your Mac. This approach follows best practices recommended by Apple and security experts for a system that has undergone a fresh install.

It appears that your script is running into an error because it’s using an older AppleScript command that targets the old “System Preferences” API, but on recent macOS versions (like Ventura and later) that interface has been replaced by “System Settings.” The pane id "com.apple.preferences.sharing" no longer exists or is accessible via AppleScript in the same way.

Here are a few recommendations:

Use Updated Commands:

Newer macOS versions have limited AppleScript support for System Settings. You might need to either use alternative scripting methods or disable remote services manually via the command line.

Manual Disabling:

For SSH, you can still use:

zsh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off
