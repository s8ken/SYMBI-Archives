 Remote Management, Screen Sharing, and File Sharing, it’s best to open 
System Settings
 manually and disable those options under the Sharing section.

Check for Documentation Updates:

Review the latest documentation or GitLab issues for iTerm2 to see if there’s a new recommended way to script these settings on modern macOS versions.

By using these updated methods, you can ensure that remote control services are permanently disabled at the system level. Let me know if you need help with any specific part of this process!

Do you really want to turn remote login off? If you do, you will lose this connection and can only turn it back on locally at the server (yes/no)? yes

Reasoned about remote access controls for 7 seconds

The error you saw is common on newer macOS versions—AppleScript no longer provides direct access to the "Sharing" pane using the old pane ID ("com.apple.preferences.sharing"). That’s why your attempt to script it resulted in an error.

Since your SSH/remote login is already off (as confirmed by the systemsetup command), you can continue with these additional steps to lock down remote control at the system level:

Manually Disable Sharing Services:

Open System Settings (or System Preferences on older versions) and navigate to Sharing. Ensure that options like Remote Management, Screen Sharing, and File Sharing are all turned off.

Enable and Configure the Firewall:

• Go to 
System Settings
 → 
Network
 → 
Firewall
.

• Turn on the firewall and set it to block all incoming connections for added security.

Audit Startup Items and Launch Agents:

Review folders like 
/Library/LaunchAgents
, 
/Library/LaunchDaemons
, and 
~/Library/LaunchAgents
 for any suspicious entries that might be related to remote access.

Monitor Open Ports:

Use a command like:

zsh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -n -P

to verify that no unexpected services are listening for remote connections.

Keep Your System Updated:

Regularly install macOS updates and security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.

These steps, combined with the confirmation that remote login is off, will greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized remote control.
