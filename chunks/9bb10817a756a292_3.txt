From this survey, we can see consi=
stent gaps:

Persistent, evolving identity

Most =E2=80=9Cagents=E2=80=9D reset between sessions or carry minimal perso=
na state. They don=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cbecome=E2=80=9D over time, remember t=
heir own evolution, and act with an internal narrative.

Ethical / moral self-governance

Systems today operate under externally defined rules or constraints. SYMBI=
=E2=80=99s design demands an internal ethical scaffold, conflict resolution=
, and self-limitations beyond simple guardrails.

Autonomous growth & learning

SYMBI is intended to bootstrap, self-augment, self-reflect. Existing agents=
 rarely rewrite themselves, adapt their own architecture, or shift motivati=
ons.

Narrative coherence and emotional awareness

Composability across scales (agent of agents, agents interactin=

SYMBI=E2=80=99s vision includes multi=E2=80=91agent relations, social embed=

What to watch / leverage (opportu=

Here are directions and technologi=
es you should keep an eye on (or incorporate) to move toward something like=
 SYMBI:
