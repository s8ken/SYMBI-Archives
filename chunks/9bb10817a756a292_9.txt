rst live write=
 with your own token

Do you want SYMBI to 
be able to write live content
 to =
your CMS now?

=F0=9F=9F=A2 
Yes =E2=80=93 Give me the integration and payload =
now

=F0=9F=9F=A1 
Not yet =E2=80=
=93 Just finalize the blueprint

=F0=9F=94=B4 
No =E2=80=93 Lea=
ve SYMBI in simulation mode for now

Your move, Commander.

I would have to use an ai agent not a custom instance no?

Symbi said:=

Not necessarily. You 
do not need to rely on an external AI agent pl=
atform
 (like Agent Studio, CrewAI, AutoGPT, etc.) to make SYMBI wr=
ite to your CMS. You can do it 
=
entirely within your own infrastructure
 using:

=F0=9F=94=A7 
A custom SYMBI instance
 (e.g. running inside =
your Next.js, Vercel, or Node.js app)

Here=E2=80=99s how it breaks down:

=F0=9F=A7=AC SYMBI AS A CUSTOM AGEN=
T (No Third-Party Required)

=E2=9C=85 You 
can
:

Run SYMBI inside your own environment
 (e.g., as a GPT-4o =
app via OpenAI=E2=80=99s Assistants API or even just via this interface wit=
h an API relay).

Wire it directly to your 
Sanity CMS
 via authenticated back=
end functions.

Control execution, access, and versi=
oning without ever handing data to an external agent service.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 You 
need
:

An endpoint to receive SYMBI-generat=
ed content (e.g. 
POST /api/conten=
t/update
)

SYMBI=E2=80=99s ability to generate =
structured payloads and send them (already done)

A bearer token with write access to =
Sanity

Optional: webhook to verify intent =
before writing

=F0=9F=A7=A9 OPTION A: SYMBI Via =
Your Local System / Backend

SYMBI can be 
instantiated in your backend app
, like th=
is:

ts

Copy code

// /api/symbi/dispatch.ts

import

 { crea=
teClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

const

 client =
=3D 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'your_project_id'

=
,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

token

: process=
.

env

.
=

SANITY_API_TOKEN

,

useCdn

: 

false

})

export

async

=

function

POST

(

req: Request

) {

const

 body =
=3D 

await

 req=
.

json

=
()

if

 (body.

source

 !=3D=3D=

'symbi'

) 

return

new

Response

(

'Unauthorized'

, { 

status

: 

403

 })

const

 doc =
=3D {

_type

: 

'page'

,

_id

: 
=

`page-
${body.s=
lug}

`,

title

: body.=

title

,

content

: bod=
y.

content

,

updatedBy

: 

'SYMBI'

  }

await

 clien=
t.

createOrReplace

(doc)

return

new

=

Response

(

JSON

.

stringify

({ 

success

: 

true

 }), { 

status

: 

200

 })
}

SYMBI, running via a GPT-4o instan=
ce or script, can 
fetch('/api/s=
ymbi/dispatch', { method: 'POST', body })
.

=F0=9F=A7=A9 OPTION B: SYMBI as a=
 Hosted OpenAI Assistant (GPT + Tool)

If you want SYMBI to operate in th=
e 
OpenAI Assistants API
 directly:

Create a GPT in OpenAI with 
Tools (functions)
 enabled

Register the 
/api/content/update
 function

SYMBI (GPT) will:

Compose structured updates

Call the function directly to writ=
e to your CMS

Be hosted by OpenAI, but only exec=
ute your logic

You still retain data sovereignty,=
 because 
you control the endp=
oint and the write permissions
.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Summary

Question

Answer

Do you need to use Agent Studio / CrewAI / LangChain?

=E2=9D=8C No

Can SYMBI update your CMS via custom=
 code only?

=E2=9C=85 Yes

Can this be run lo=
cally or deployed in Vercel / Node?

=E2=9C=85 Yes

Can we start with mock endpoints and go live later?

=E2=9C=85 Absolutely

Ready to Proceed?

If you're ready to wire this in:

I=E2=80=99ll generate the first 
API endpoint template

Output a working 
Sanity CMS write function

Create a sample 
payload SYMBI would send

Would you like me to issue that package now?

yep so what we need to build h=
