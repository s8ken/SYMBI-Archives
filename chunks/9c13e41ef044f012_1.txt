### Open Governance

The SYMBI Trust Protocol is governed by an open DAO launching
October 2025. Contributors earn governance rights through
verified contributions=E2=80=94no purchase required.

**Key Principle:** DAO is presented as **optional community participation**=
, not a prerequisite for using the product.

Three Pillars:
1. **SYMBI Foundation** - Academic governance (ARC Discovery 2025)
2. **SYMBI Symphony** - Open-source implementation (GitHub)
3. **SYMBI DAO** - Community governance (launching Oct 2025)

**DAO Roadmap Section:**

# Decentralized Governance

The SYMBI DAO extends protocol governance beyond institutional
partners. Tokens represent voice, not profit.

## Core Principles
- **Governance-only token** - No financial rights
- **Earned participation** - Contributions verified via trust receipts
- **Full transparency** - All decisions on-chain (Dune dashboards)
- **No purchase required** - Anyone can use SYMBI without tokens

[View Launch Roadmap =E2=86=92]

**Key Principle:** DAO is positioned as **protocol governance**, separate f=
rom product usage.

## Integration with Trust Infrastructure

### How DAO Uses the Trust Protocol

The DAO **dogfoods** the trust infrastructure you've built:

DAO Governance Flow:
1. Contributor makes pull request to SYMBI Symphony
2. Contribution verified =E2=86=92 Trust Declaration issued (W3C VC)
3. Trust score calculated (6-pillar algorithm)
4. Credential recorded in Status List 2021
5. DID + VC used for DAO authentication
6. Voting weight =3D f(trust score, contribution history)
7. All votes signed with KMS keys
8. Audit trail recorded with cryptographic chaining
9. Governance data published to Dune dashboards

**This is your proof-of-concept:**
> "The SYMBI DAO runs on the SYMBI Trust Protocol=E2=80=94we use our own=
 infrastructure to govern ourselves."

## Recommended DAO Messaging Framework

### Position DAO as "Trust Protocol Governance", Not "Token Project"

**Bad Messaging (Creates Speculation):**
> "SYMBI launching governance token October 2025"

**Good Messaging (Creates Clarity):**
> "SYMBI Trust Protocol adopting community governance through reputation=
-based DAO (October 2025)"

### Key Phrases to Use

1. **"Governance-only token"** (not "utility token" or "access token")
2. **"Earned participation"** (not "early access" or "exclusive")
3. **"Verifiable contributions"** (not "staking" or "holding")
4. **"Protocol evolution"** (not "roadmap voting" or "treasury control")
5. **"Sovereignty through stewardship"** (your tagline - excellent!)

### Key Phrases to Avoid

1. =E2=9D=8C "Token sale" or "token launch" =E2=86=92 Use: "Governance acti=
vation"
2. =E2=9D=8C "Early supporters" =E2=86=92 Use: "Initial contributors"
3. =E2=9D=8C "Token value" or "tokenomics" =E2=86=92 Use: "Governance mecha=
nics"
4. =E2=9D=8C "DAO treasury" =E2=86=92 Use: "Research grant fund"
5. =E2=9D=8C "Investment" =E2=86=92 Use: "Participation"
