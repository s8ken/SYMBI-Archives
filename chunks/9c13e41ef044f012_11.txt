SYMBI DAO: Governance Without Speculation

The SYMBI DAO is a proposed govern=
ance layer for the SYMBI Trust Protocol =E2=80=94 the world=E2=80=99s first=
 verifiable trust infrastructure for AI agents.

Tokens cannot be bought, sold, or =
traded.

They can only be earned, verified, and used for stewardship.

Every governance action is transpa=
rent, cryptographically verifiable, and rooted in ethics.

This is governance as proof, not governance as profit.
