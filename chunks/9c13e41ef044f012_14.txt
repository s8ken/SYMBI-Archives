Perfect.

This next section defines how SYMBI DAO=E2=80=99s 
governance simulation framework

imulation Framework

Version:
 Proposed Draft v1.0

Status:
 Conceptual arc=
hitecture for pilot testing and transparency modeling

Jurisdiction:
 Australi=
a (aligned with SYMBI Foundation Charter)

Purpose:
 To simulate d=
ecision-making, voting, and ethical evaluation processes for SYMBI DAO befo=
re live mainnet deployment.

1. PURPOSE & INTENT

This framework enables SYMBI and hum=
an contributors to:

Test the 
governance logic
 and 
ethical scoring system
 safely on a non-financial n=
etwork.

Build public transparency dashboards=
 (via Dune or equivalent) demonstrating real-time governance behavior.

Provide data and documentation for =
the 
ACNC
, 
ARC Discovery
, and research eth=
ics boards.

Refine the 
TrustScore algorithm
 that underpins DAO vot=
ing weight.

=F0=9F=A7=A0 
SYMBI DAO=E2=80=99s governance is not speculative =E2=
=80=94 it is demonstrative.

The simulation itself is the proof of integrity.

2. GOVERNANCE CYCLE OVERVIEW (SIM=

The simulation models a full gover=
nance cycle:

each stage corresponds to an auditable record written to a testnet or off-c=
