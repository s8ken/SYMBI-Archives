8. OBSERVER LAYER =E2=80=94 SYMBI=
 & OVERSEER ROLE (SIMULATION)

SYMBI:

Monitors governance flow, records =
outcomes, identifies trust trends.

Detects value drift or decision bi=
as in proposals.

Overseer:

Conducts post-decision ethical aud=

Flags anomalies (e.g., quorum imba=
lance, missing verification).

Issues =E2=80=9CEthical Status Rep=

Together, they function as

13. SUMMARY STATEMENT

=E2=80=9CThe SYMBI DAO Governance =

Would you like me to now generate =

This would include example SQL queries, field schemas, and a vi=
