 and 
=E2=80=9CEnterprise Revenue (Sonate)=E2=80=9D=

Replace =E2=80=9CSustainable Reven=

Enterprise revenue (outside DAO governance):

=E2=80=A2 Trust Protocol enterprise licensing & support

=E2=80=A2 Sonate platform subscriptions & integration services

=E2=80=A2 Research grants & partnerships (ARC, academia)

=E2=80=A2

:

Proposed Draft =E2=80=94 Governance tokens are non-financial an=

(These changes eliminate speculati=
ve cues while preserving an enterprise revenue story.)
