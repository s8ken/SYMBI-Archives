Usage Notes

Use as the final footer block on a=
ll 
yseeku.com
 pages =
(below any contact or legal lines).

It keeps the 
commercial credibility
 of Yseeku while ac=
knowledging the shared ethical and technical base with SYMBI and Gammatria.=

Once the Foundation is legally reg=
istered, replace =E2=80=9C(Proposed Non-Profit)=E2=80=9D with =E2=80=9CSYMB=
I Foundation Inc.=E2=80=9D

Would you like me to produce a 
set of unified brand/legal templates
 next (for foote=
r + meta + license banners) so that all three domains display the same stru=
cture automatically? This would cover metadata tags, open-graph lines, and =
license text for uniform SEO and compliance.

You said:

so next is a full review of gammatria.com to en=
sure it aligns with the overall framework and to ensure it isn't overreachi=
ng in terms of where we stand currently
