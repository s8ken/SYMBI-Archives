If you can share either:

a link to the 
current live site
 (any page), or

a 
screenshot / exported HTML / text dump
 of the main secti=
ons,

I can then perform a 
full content and structure review
 =E2=
=80=94 checking:

Alignment with the verified framewor=
k (DAO constitution, legal posture, governance-only model).

Tone and scope (avoiding overreach, =
speculation, or premature claims).

Recommended revisions by section (he=
ro, about, governance, research, footer).

Would you like to upload a recent copy or export of the 
gammatria.com
 content so I can =
review it line by line for consistency?

If you can please do one of the foll=

Copy & paste
 the main page text (or sections like Her=

or

Upload
 an exported HTML, 
.txt
, or 
.pdf
 snapshot of the current gammatria.com site.

Once I have that, I=E2=80=99ll:

Assess tone and factual accuracy rel=
ative to the verified SYMBI framework,

Flag any =E2=80=9Coverreach=E2=80=9D=
 (claims that imply implementation not yet completed), and

Suggest replacements that keep it co=
mpliant and aligned with the =E2=80=9CProposed Draft=E2=80=9D status.

Would you like to upload a PDF or HTML export of the site now?
