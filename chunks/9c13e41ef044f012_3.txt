- Votes cast (by contributor tier)
- Treasury grants allocated
- Constitution Node updates
- Integration: "All governance on-chain =E2=86=92"

**Message:** Transparent, accountable governance

#### 3. **Trust Protocol Health Dashboard** (both audiences)

- Audit log integrity checks
- Integration: "Real-time trust metrics =E2=86=92"

## Three Pillars of Sovereignty

### SYMBI Foundation
Academic governance via ARC Discovery Projects (Nov 2025)
Open research, peer review, constitutional stewardship

### SYMBI Symphony
Open-source implementation (MIT/Apache 2.0)

# How SYMBI DAO Uses SYMBI Trust Protocol

The SYMBI DAO is built on the trust infrastructure we're standardizing.
Every governance action demonstrates the protocol in production.

## Contributor Identity
- **DIDs:** Each contributor has a W3C DID (did:web or did:key)
- **Authentication:** All votes signed with DID keys
- **Resolution:** Universal DID resolver validates all participants

## Contribution Verification
- **Trust Declarations:** Contributions issued as W3C VCs
- **6-Pillar Scoring:** Quality measured by trust algorithm
- **Attestations:** GitHub commits, code reviews, documentation

## Voting Mechanics
- **Weight:** Voting power =3D f(trust score, contribution history)
- **Cryptographic Signatures:** Every vote signed via KMS
- **Audit Trail:** All governance recorded with hash chaining
- **Transparency:** Live metrics on Dune dashboards

## Revocation & Appeals
- **Status List 2021:** Compromised credentials revoked privately
- **Privacy-Preserving:** No public list of revoked contributors
- **Appeals Process:** Constitution Node 5 (right to disconnect)

**Why This Works:**
- Proves the trust protocol is production-ready
- Shows concrete technical integration
- Demonstrates "we use what we build"
- Differentiates from vaporware DAOs

## Competitive Positioning with DAO

### How DAO Strengthens vs. Competitors

| Competitor | Governance Model | SYMBI Advantage |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|

| **MakerDAO** | Financial governance | Reputation-based, no speculation |
| **Ocean Protocol** | Token-gated | Earned participation |

**Positioning:**
> "SYMBI combines the transparency of crypto governance with the rigor o=
f academic research=E2=80=94without the speculation."
