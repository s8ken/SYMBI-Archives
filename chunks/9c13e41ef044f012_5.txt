on** in all messaging, or you risk:

1. Confusing enterprise buyers ("Is this crypto?")
2. Triggering securities law concerns ("Are tokens investments?")
3. Diluting your technical positioning ("Just another DAO")

**The solution:**
- **yseeku.com** =3D Enterprise trust infrastructure (production-ready, no =
tokens)
- **gammatria.com** =3D Protocol governance + academic research (DAO for co=
ntributors)
- **Dune dashboards** =3D Public proof of both

**Tagline for DAO launch:**
> "Sovereignty through stewardship, verifiable through infrastructure."

This frames the DAO as a **demonstration of your trust protocol's capabilit=
ies**, not a separate crypto project.

Objective:
 Integrate SYMBI DAO governance with the Trust =
Protocol and enterprise-facing narrative while securing intellectual owners=
hip and compliance.

1. Current Standing

SYMBI Trust Protocol
 =E2=80=94 operational layer; W3C DID=

Sonate Platform
 =E2=80=94 enterprise product built on the=
 protocol; production-ready, compliance-oriented.

SYMBI DAO
 =E2=80=94 governance mechanism; launching Octob=
er 2025 to manage protocol evolution using earned, non-financial governance=
 tokens.

Core Identity:
 =E2=80=9CSovereignty without speculation.=
=E2=80=9D

Governance participation =E2=89=A0 product usage.

5. Technical Integration Path

DAO governance transactions use th=

SYMBI Trust Protocol
 itself for DID auth & VC-based voting.

Dune dashboards
 expose:

Credential issuance

Governance votes

Revocation logs

Trust protocol uptime metrics

This simultaneously:

Demonstrates the protocol in produ=

Reinforces the =E2=80=9Ctrust infr=
