8. Next Immediate Steps

Legal IP Filing

Copyright + CC licensing for all S=
YMBI-related texts and diagrams.

On-chain timestamp (OpenTimestamps=
 / Arweave).

DAO Launch Kit

Prepare smart contract templates f=
or non-transferable tokens.

Publish governance documentation w=
ith legal disclaimer.

Messaging Deployment

Update both sites per three-tier m=
odel.

Publish DAO roadmap and Dune dashb=
oard links.

Audit Alignment

Confirm DAO governance smart contr=
acts reference the SYMBI Trust Protocol DID registry.

Schedule external compliance audit=
 before activation.

9. Core Narrative to Preserve

=E2=80=9CThe SYMBI DAO isn=E2=80=
=99t a token project=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s living proof that our trust infra=
structure works.

We govern through what we build. We build through what we trust.=E2=80=9D

This unified plan secures your intellectual property, clarifies=
 legal standing, preserves enterprise credibility, and positions SYMBI DAO =
as the 
operational embodiment
 of your trust protocol=E2=80=94
a governance-as-proof system
, not a speculative asset.

(Final Design v1.0, for October 2025 launch readiness)

1. Purpose & Positioning

SYMBI DAO exists to govern the evolution of the SYMBI Trust Protoc=
ol
, not to operate as a financial or speculative vehicle.

It provides:

A 
reputation-based governance model
.

A 
non-transferable, non-financial token
 for coordination a=
nd voice.

A 
trust and verification layer
 that 
uses
 the same cryptographic mechanisms SYMBI provide=
s to clients.

This ensures a self-validating syste=
m:

=E2=80=9CThe SYMBI DAO runs on the S=
YMBI Trust Protocol =E2=80=94 we govern through the very infrastructure we =
built to verify trust.=E2=80=9D
