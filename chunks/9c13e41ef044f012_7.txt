l-Based)

Stepwise issuance via SYMBI Trust Protocol:

1.

 Contributor c=
ompletes verified action:

 Code merg=
e, research paper, governance proposal, or credentialed review.

2.

 Action is a=
ttested via W3C VC issued by the SYMBI Trust Authority.

3.

 VC recorded=
 in decentralized registry (StatusList2021 format).

4.

 TrustScore =
recalculated via SYMBI 6-pillar algorithm:
   (Integrity, Contribution Quality, Peer Review, Longevity, Transparency, =
Ethical Compliance)

Dune dashboard publicly logs: prop=

5. Governance Cycle (DAO Operatio=
ns Flow)

1. Proposal Creation

Contributor (verified) submits proposal with DID-auth.

Proposal must reference specific Trust Protocol section or standard.

2. Review Window (7=E2=80=9314 days)

Peers with equal or higher TrustScore review/comment.

3. Vote Phase (5 days)

Quadratic vote weighting; minimum quorum 30 active nodes.

4. Execution

If passed, implementation logged to chain and cross-published to Dune dashb=
oard.

Changes to protocol auto-committed to GitHub repo + Trust Ledger.

5. Post-Vote Audit

Overseer AI runs post-vote audit verifying:

Proposal consistency

Vote legitimacy (no double DIDs)

Audit trail integrity

6. Treasury & Funding

No speculative treasury.

Instead, SYMBI DAO maintains a

Controlled via multisig (3/5 =E2=
