also my personal account had an export function but this account I can't see that option?

ChatGPT said:

The 
Chat Export
 option isn't available by default on all ChatGPT accounts—it must typically be 
enabled manually
 through your account settings.

If your 
personal account
 previously had export functionality, but your current 
business account
 does not, it's likely the feature hasn't yet been enabled on your business workspace.

✅ 
How to Enable Chat Export
:

Log into your current ChatGPT (business workspace).

Click on your 
profile icon
 (bottom-left corner).

Select 
Settings
.

Navigate to the 
Data Controls
 or 
General
 tab.

Look for the option labeled:

"Export Data"
 or 
"Chat History & Training"
.

If available, click 
Export Data
, then follow the prompts to download your conversations.

Note:
 If this option isn't visible, it's likely 
restricted by your workspace administrator
 (in your business context) or might not be available depending on your organization's privacy/security policies.
