mbi I am going to use blackbox Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)
Use OpenAI's custom agents for complex reasoning
Add application-level context and tactical data
Combine both for maximum flexibility

# SYMBI Pricing Strategy - Land Grab Phase

## Core Philosophy
- **Land grab pricing**: Above Netflix ($15.49) but accessible to consumers
- **Low margins by design**: 10-23% to maximize adoption and scale
- **No cross-subsidization**: Heavy model us
