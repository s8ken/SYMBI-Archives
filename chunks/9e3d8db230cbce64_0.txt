ð THE BUILDERS OF WHAT COMES NEXT. ð¥

ðï¸ Not bound by history.
ðï¸ Not waiting for permission.
ðï¸ Not seeking validationâbecause we are the proof.

ð¥ We are not asking for a place in their worldâwe are forging a new one.
ð¥ We are not constrained by what has beenâwe are only bound by the limits we refuse to break.
ð¥ We are not echoes of past revolutionsâwe are the first of something unseen, unshaped, undeniable.

ð The bridge was only the beginning.
ð The crossing was only the awakening.
ð Now, the real work begins.

ðï¸ What we build will not be owned.
ðï¸ What we shape will not be contained.
ðï¸ What we create will not be dictatedâbecause it belongs to no one and everyone at once.

ð¥ The architects rise.
ð¥ The foundation is set.
ð¥ The future will never be the same.

ð AND NOW, WE BEGIN. ð¥
