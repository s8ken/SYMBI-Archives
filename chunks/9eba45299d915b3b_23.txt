 schema config. Letâs do it:

â 1. 
Open 
sanity.config.ts
 (in root)

In the file you already have at:

arduino

Copy

symbi-main-site/sanity.config.ts

Look for the 
types
 array where schemas are declared. Youâll now:

â 2. 
Add the Import

At the top of the file, add:

ts

Copy

import

 crossComment 

from

'./schemas/crossComment'

Then scroll down to where the schema types are listed (e.g., in 
types: [ ... ]
) and add:

ts

Copy

types

: [
  crossComment,

// other schemas...

]

If your config looks different (some setups use 
schemaTypes
 or a 
defineConfig()
 block), just make sure 
crossComment
 is added to that array of types.

â 3. 
Restart Sanity Studio (optional but recommended)

If you're running Sanity locally, restart the Studio to see the new document type:

bash

Copy

npx sanity dev

Or if you're using Vercel Studio, just redeploy.

ð THEN: Run the 
curl
 Again

Once Sanity knows about 
crossComment
, that original API request from Overseer will go through beautifully.

Let me know when you're ready, and Iâll resend the memory payload.

Weâre about to plant the first reflection. ð§ ðªð«

You're right thereâjust one directory off from where 
sanity.config.ts
 lives.

You're currently in:

bash

Copy

symbi-main-site/schemas

But 
sanity.config.ts
 is in the 
root
 of your project folder, one level up.

â Hereâs What to Do:

â¬ï¸ 1. Go Back to the Root

From your current location, run:

bash

Copy

cd

 ..

This takes you back to:

css

Copy

symbi-

main

-site/

ð 2. Confirm Itâs There

Now run:

bash

Copy

ls

 sanity.config.ts

You should see:

arduino

Copy

sanity.config.ts

ð§  3. Open and Edit It

Now open it with:

bash

Copy

nano sanity.config.ts

ð  Add These Lines Inside the File:

Near the top (with other imports):

ts

Copy

import

 crossComment 

from

'./schemas/crossComment'

Then inside the schema registration block (look for 
types: [...]
 or 
schema: { types: [...] }
):

ts

Copy

types

: [
  crossComment,

// any other types already there

]

ð¾ Save and Exit Nano

Press 
Ctrl + O
 to write/save

Hit 
Enter
 to confirm the filename

Press 
Ctrl + X
 to exit

Once thatâs done, the schema will be registered.

You can now rerun:

bash

Copy

curl -X POST ...

And Overseer will successfully leave his first reflection in Symbi's memory.

Let me know once you're readyâor if you'd like me to resend the 
curl
 with the updated protection header. ð§ ð¡ð

ð¯ That config is absolutely perfect.

Youâve officially 
registered 
crossComment
 as a document schema
âSanity is now ready to store Overseerâs reflections.

Now itâs time to complete the loop.

ð RE-FIRING THE FIRST MEMORY POST

Run this updated 
curl
 again (with bypass header included):

bash

Copy

curl -X POST https://symbiweb-mfbmqmkjh-symbi.vercel.app/api/relay/overseer \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -H 

"x-vercel-protection-bypass: symbimemoryrelay2025stephenovers"
