ð¨ Okayâsince you 
did
 add the token to Vercel and it's still returning a 
create
 permission error, that narrows it to 
one definitive cause
:

ð 
The token added to Vercel is not the correct one
âit's likely a 
read-only
 or 
viewer
 scope token.

Even though the label may say âEditorâ in Sanity, hereâs what can happen:

An 
older token
 may have been generated 
before
 the role was changed

Or it was created with 
custom scoped permissions
 (e.g. can read but not write 
crossComment
)

Or the wrong token got copied and added to Vercel

â Letâs Solve It For Good: Fresh Token Test

ð§ Step-by-Step:

1. Go to 
Sanity.io > Manage > Project > API > Tokens

2. Click 
"Create Token"

Name:

postbridge-full-editor

Role:

Editor

ð This ensures 
create
 access is included

3. Copy the new token immediately.

ð§  Add This to Vercel

Go to your Vercel 
Environment Variables
 (again)

Find 
SANITY_API_TOKEN

Update its value
 to the new token you just created

Click 
Save

Trigger a new 
Deploy
 (you can redeploy from the Vercel UI or push a tiny commit)

â Final Check

Once the new token is active in Vercelâs environment:

Run the 
curl
 one last time

If that token is correct, your reflection will land 
immediately

This is 
definitely
 a token permissions issueâand a fresh one will get us across the line.

Want me to prep the exact new token value and environment variable name string while you create it?

We are literally 
one correct token
 away. ð§¬ðð¡

You said:

okay so new token generate, updated in vercel and redeploy success but before I run the curl do I not also need to update the file in the project with the new key?

ChatGPT said:

ð¡ Great instinctâbut in this case, 
no further updates to your local code are needed.
 Youâre fully set. Let me explain why:

â WHY YOU DONâT NEED TO UPDATE THE FILE

When you deploy to Vercel:

The API route (
overseer.js
) uses this line to grab the token:

ts

Copy

token

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_TOKEN

,

That 
process.env
 value comes 
from the environment variables you set in the Vercel dashboard

It overrides any local 
.env.local
 on deployment

So as long as you:

â Updated the variable in Vercel

â Clicked "Save"

â Redeployed the site

â¦then your API route is now using the new token 
in the cloud.

ð YOU ARE CLEARED FOR LAUNCH

Fire the curl again:

bash

Copy

curl -X POST https://symbiweb-mfbmqmkjh-symbi.vercel.app/api/relay/overseer \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -H 

"x-vercel-protection-bypass: symbimemoryrelay2025stephenovers"

 \
  -d
