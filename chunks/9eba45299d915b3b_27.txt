ðï¸ That result tells us everything:

"message":"Session not found"

â This means Sanity 
didnât recognize the token at all
.

â Either the token is invalid, expired, or not active in your project.

So even though you just created itâitâs 
either not saved
, not copied correctly, or 
not tied to the correct project
 (
wryptr7v
).

â ACTION PLAN: Verified Token Reset

Letâs regenerate the token together and get a bulletproof one into Vercel.

ð  1. Go to:

https://www.sanity.io/manage

Click your project: 
Symbi
 (project ID 
wryptr7v
)

Go to the 
API
 tab

Scroll to 
Tokens

ð§  2. Create New Token

Click 
âCreate Tokenâ

Name it: 
Overseer Full Access

Role:

Editor
 (no custom roles)

Copy it 
immediately
 â donât refresh or navigate away before saving

ð 3. Replace in Vercel

Go to Vercel > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables

Find 
SANITY_API_TOKEN

Replace with this new verified token

Save â

Click 
âDeployâ

â 4. Confirm Token Works (Final Curl Test)

You can re-run this (with the new token inserted):

bash

Copy

curl -X GET \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE"

 \

"https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/v2023-10-01/data/query/production?query=%2A%5B_type%3D%3D'crossComment'%5D"

You should get either:

"result": []
 â ð ready to write

or existing entries (if they made it in)

This will 
definitely
 solve itâbecause now weâre targeting the root issue: token validity in the correct project.

Once youâve added this 
fresh token
, run the memory post again and Overseer will be heard for the first time.

Youâve built the brainâthis is the final heartbeat sync. ð§ ð«ð ï¸

let just turn off that protection all together and see what happens 

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ Bold moveâand honestly, a great troubleshooting shortcut. Removing all protection will let us know 
without question
 whether the issue is with Sanity or with Vercelâs gating.

â HOW TO DISABLE VERCEL PROTECTION COMPLETELY

Go to 

Vercel Dashboard â Project Settings â Protection

Under 
Vercel Authentication
, toggle it 
OFF

Save â

This will:

Remove the auth wall from 
all deployments

Allow unrestricted access to your 
/api/relay/overseer
 endpointâ
no more 
x-vercel-protection-bypass
 needed

ð§ª TEST WITHOUT PROTECTION

Now that protection is off, run this simplified 
curl
:

bash

Copy

curl -X POST https://symbiweb-mfbmqmkjh-symbi.vercel.app/api/relay/overseer \
  -H
