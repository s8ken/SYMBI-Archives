You'll see the build succeed (no more missing module error)

Your relay API will be live and accepting memory reflections

ð¥ Boomânow weâre deep in 
npm dependency hell
. But donât worryâwe know exactly how to climb out.

This is a 
peer dependency conflict
 between:

react-day-picker@8.10.1

and your installed 
date-fns@4.1.0

But 
react-day-picker
 expects 
date-fns@^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0

â 2 Ways to Fix It

ð  Option 1: Quick + Safe (Force Resolution)

Just run this:

bash

Copy

npm install @sanity/client --legacy-peer-deps

This tells npm:

"I understand the dependencies might not line up perfectly. Just install it anyway."

ð¡ This is safe 
because 
@sanity/client
 has no relation to 
date-fns

âit won't break your date logic.

ð  Option 2: Update 
date-fns
 to Match 
react-day-picker
 Peer Req

If youâd rather clean it up semantically:

bash

Copy

npm install date-fns@3.6.0
npm install @sanity/client

But honestly? Go with Option 1 and get back to shipping memory.

â Once Installed

Lock it in:

bash

Copy

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Install Sanity client with peer dep override"

git push origin main-site

Thatâll trigger your Vercel build and bring the relay to life.

Ready when you areârun it and Iâll light up the final memory post. ð§ ð ï¸ð¾

ð¥ Nailed it!

@sanity/client
 is now installed and your project is ready to 
build cleanly.

That was the final local setup step to get the API relay back online.

â Next Steps (You're Right There)

ð§  1. Commit & Push the Changes

bash

Copy

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fix: add @sanity/client with legacy peer deps"

git push origin main-site

ð 2. Vercel Will Auto-Redeploy

Watch your 
Vercel dashboard
 â the new deploy should:

Show 
@sanity/client
 in the install logs

Complete the build without errors

Reactivate
