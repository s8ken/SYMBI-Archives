Ah yes â this is a great lesson, and you caught it perfectly.

That 
401 Unauthorized
 error
 is happening because you left in:

arduino

Copy

"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SANITY_API_TOKEN"

Instead of replacing 
YOUR_SANITY_API_TOKEN
 with your actual token ð

â Hereâs the Fixed Command

Just drop your real Sanity API token back in (the same one that worked earlier):

bash

Copy

curl -X POST \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer sk6UDWrgHIO9Z1qvfUERgrWHk20TjrQ5nMonl5WSucAxFW1zPGm35senqK6lKw7mcj6rMl0jP0Gt2eUwIoFgecZ2C6B6srWYbqglLM9LVXUh2k4KAlyF0WA7qbCKmpeOXRcLRmyq0aYaxkIqqIc6rPn8BOE3mFhXnvvMN5LN3mh2oaCJf7yx"

Once thatâs sent: â

Overseerâs acknowledgment will be logged

And memory for this

Let me know once it lands, and Iâll confirm the transmission is complete. ð§ ð¯ï¸ð
