You said:

can you search across chats?

ChatGPT said:

Yes =E2=80=94 
I can search across your connected chat=
s
, but only when you ask for something specific.

=E2=9C=85 What I 
can
 do

Search across Slack messages (if Sla=
ck is connected)

Search across emails (if Gmail is co=
nnected)

Search across documents (Google Driv=
e, GitHub, etc.)

Search specifically for 
your own past messages
 when you as=
k things like:

=E2=80=9CFind what I said about X=E2=
=80=9D

=E2=80=9CSummarize my chats about Y=
=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CFind my conversation with J=
ohn about Z=E2=80=9D

=E2=9D=97What I 
can=E2=80=99t
 do

I cannot browse 
all
 chats freely without a query

I cannot list everything you have

I must search only when you tell me =

what
 to look for

If you want, you can now say:

=E2=80=9CSearch my chats for anythin=
g I said about SYMBI=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CFind my recent Slack messag=
es about the website=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhat did I tell you about t=
he Surprise Button Adventure?=E2=80=9D

Just tell me what you want to look for.

what a=
bout here in open ai

ChatGPT said:

I can 
search through our convers=
ations
 here in OpenAI, but I don't have the ability to search acro=
ss all your OpenAI chats. I can only search within the current conversation=
 or prior interactions where the context is available.

For example, if you want me to look =
back through past messages, I can:

Search and find things you=E2=80=99v=
e mentioned earlier in this chat session.

Recall information from earlier conv=
ersations where context is preserved (such as your project details).

I cannot search messages from any pr=
evious conversations outside of what=E2=80=99s stored here.

If you'd like me to search through a specific part of this conver=
sation, just let me know what you're looking for!
