Cryptographic Proof for Every AI Decision
:

Every AI decision generates an 
immutable cryptographic receipt
 that ensures the decision-making process can be audited and verified.

Bias Detection and Fairness
:

SYMBI integrates real-time 
bias detection
 and 
continuous fairness monitoring
 across AI models, helping companies ensure that their AI systems are not=
 biased and are compliant with ethical standards.

Multi-Provider Support
:

The platform supports multiple AI =
providers (e.g., 
OpenAI
, 
Anthropic
, 
Perplexity
), allowing fo=
r unified governance and comparative analysis across different AI systems.

Compliance Dashboard
:

A 
real-time dashboard
 provides insights into the compl=
iance and performance of AI systems, with features like 
automated compliance scoring
, 
audit trails
, and 
performance metrics
.

Market Opportunity
:

The project is positioned to tap i=
nto the 
AI trust and complian=
ce infrastructure
 market, with a 
$62B Total Addressable Market (TAM)
 and significant g=
rowth driven by regulatory mandates like the EU AI Act.

Technological Infrastructure

Backend
: Built with 
Node.js/Express
, ensuring enterprise-grade security an=
d real-time communication.

Frontend
: Developed using 
React
 and 
Material-UI
, offering a professional interface with feat=
ures like 
live metrics
 and 
AI agent management
.

Database
: Uses 
MongoDB
 with 
=
Mongoose ODM
 to handle data models and interactions.

Development and Progress

Testing and Quality Assurance
:

The platform has 
95% test coverage
 across both backend=
 (using 
Jest
) and fr=
ontend (using 
Playwright
 for end-to-end testing). Security, performance, and accessibility are =
key focus areas.

Live Demo
: A live demo of SYMBI is available, providin=
g a hands-on experience of its core capabilities like real-time audit trail=
s, multi-provider AI comparisons, and bias detection.

Key Milestones

Patent Filed
: SYMBI has filed a 
patent in Australia
, securing a competitiv=
e advantage for the next 
18 m=
onths
.

EU AI Act Compliance
: The platform is 
95% compliant
 with the EU AI Act, wi=
th full certification expected in 
Q1 2025
.

Investment Opportunity
: The project is currently seeki=
ng investment to scale its engineering and architecture, as well as enterpr=
ise sales.

Future Directions

The SYMBI project aims to expand f=
urther into areas like:

Decentralized Governance
 via a 
DAO
, allowing for 
token-based voting
 on framework evolution and=
 research priorities. This is planned for 
preview in Q1 2026
 with full launch targeted for 
Q2 2026
.

Ecosystem Integration
: The plat=
form is also linked with related sites like 
symbi.world
 and 
yseeku.com
, which are integrated into its overall visio=
n of providing 
trust
=
 and 
compliance solutions
 for AI systems   .
