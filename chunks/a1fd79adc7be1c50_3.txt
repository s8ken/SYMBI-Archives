From that same PR and its bot comm=

Gammatria is deployed via 
Vercel
, and at least one pre=

error
 state in the Vercel status table.

Put together with the SYMBI repo:

You=E2=80=99ve got:

Production-ish app + demo

Monitoring stack

But you=E2=80=99re still:

Fighting occasional deploy issues =
on the marketing side

Iterating copy/positioning fairly =
actively

My read:
 on the 
delivery
 axis you=E2=80=99re at 
=E2=80=9Cit works, but we=E2=80=99re still sanding down reliabi=

5. If you want a =E2=80=9Cnext mo=
ves=E2=80=9D view

If you=E2=80=99d like, I can:

Propose a

AI vs human performance

Trust scores / bias alerts

Compliance coverage per model / te=

Draft 
homepage copy
 for symbi.world that:

Lines up tightly with the SYMBI-SY=
NERGY capabilities

Feels consistent with the =E2=80=
=9Cobservational / experimental=E2=80=9D framing from Gammatria

Speaks to 
regulators, boards, and heads of risk
 in the=

From everything I can see:
