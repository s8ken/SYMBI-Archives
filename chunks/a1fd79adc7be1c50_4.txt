moment you ask explicitly, I 
can
 load them.

=E2=9C=85 If you'd like, I can chec=
k them right now.

Just tell me:

=E2=80=9CCheck 
https://gammatria.com

 and 
https://ys=
eeku.com

 and=
 tell me what you see.=E2=80=9D

Or:

=E2=80=9CLoad both sites and give me a detailed analysis.=E2=80=9D=

Or even:

=E2=80=9CTell me whether they=E2=80=99re live, broken, or misconfi=
gured.=E2=80=9D

Once you say the word, I=E2=80=99ll run the web tool, fetch the l=
ive content, and give you a full breakdown.

You said:

yes also include https://symbi.world and add them to your analysis o=
f my project as they are my sites

Thought for 7s

Got it, thanks for confirming they=E2=80=99re your sites =
=F0=9F=91=8D

Here=E2=80=99s what I can see (and ca=
n=E2=80=99t) from 
this
 environme=
nt, and what that implies for your project.

1. What actually happened when I tr=
ied to load your sites

When I tried to open each URL via th=
e browsing tool, I got client fetch errors from this environment:

symbi.world
 =E2=86=92 
ClientResponseError

=

Invalid U=
RL

gammatria.com
 =E2=86=92 
ClientResponseError

=

Invalid U=
RL

yseeku.com
 =E2=86=92 
ClientResponseError

Invalid URL

Important nuance:

These errors mean 
the environme=
nt I=E2=80=99m running in couldn=E2=80=99t fetch them
. That could =
be due to:

DNS / SSL / redirect config on the d=
omains

Firewall / blocking rules (e.g. Clou=
dflare, IP blocks, geo-fencing)

Or limitations / quirks of this spec=
ific OpenAI browsing environment

I 
can=E2=80=99t
 reliably tell which from here. So I 
can=E2=80=99t
 say =E2=80=9Cyour s=
ites are down=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 only that 
my end can=E2=80=99t reach them right now
.

So for your own sanity check, I=E2=
=80=99d suggest:

Open them in:

Your normal browser

Mobile network (hotspot) vs home/o=
ffice Wi-Fi

Use an external checker like =E2=
=80=9CIsItDownRightNow=E2=80=9D or 
curl
/
dig
 loca=
lly.

That will tell you whether it=E2=
=80=99s 
me
 or the sites.

2. How I=E2=80=99ll treat them in=
 your project analysis

Even though I can=E2=80=99t see th=
e live pages right now, I 
do
 know a bit about how they=E2=80=99re 
intended
 to function from your repos and PRs:
