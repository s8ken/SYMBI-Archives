So even without seeing the current=
 pixels, I can say:

Your project has grown from a=
 single prototype into a multi-site narrative and product ecosystem.

3. What the fetch errors 
might
 imply about maturity

Given I=E2=80=99m seeing fetch err=
ors from here and saw a recent deployment error for 
gammatria-site
 in Vercel logs in your PR contex=
t 

=

Refine claims and emp=
hasize cas=E2=80=A6

, my best inference is:

You=E2=80=99re in an 
active iteration phase
:

Tweaking DNS / SSL / deployment

Pushing content + copy updates

Occasionally causing transient bre=
akage

That=E2=80=99s not a red flag, jus=
t a 
phase
: you=E2=80=
=99re wiring together multiple sites with live deploys, probably still test=
ing flows between them.

From a =E2=80=9Cprogress=E2=80=9D =
lens, that suggests:

Architecture & concept: 
Advanced

Ecosystem & narrative: 
Interlinked and maturing

Reliability / uptime / polish: 
Still being stabilised

4. If you want, we can make this =
more concrete

Since I can=E2=80=99t see the curr=
ent HTML/CSS, the best next steps we could do 
together
 are conceptual / structural:

Design a 
clear role
 for each site:

symbi.world =E2=86=92 high-level s=
tory + case studies

gammatria.com =E2=86=92 research l=
og + experimental designs + methods

yseeku.com =E2=86=92 productised S=
onate platform with SYMBI integration

Draft or refine:

A 
1-screen story
 for each homepage (headline, subhead,=
 3 proof points, 1 CTA)

A simple 
linking map
 (from each site, where should pri=
mary CTAs go?)

If you tell me which site you care=
 about first (symbi, Gammatria, or YCQ/Sonate), I can draft a homepage stru=
cture and copy that fits the SYMBI-SYNERGY reality you=E2=80=99ve already b=
uilt.
