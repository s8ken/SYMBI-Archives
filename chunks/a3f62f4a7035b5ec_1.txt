Step 2: Choose Minting Platform

Zora Creator Toolkit
 â Dead simple and gas-efficient (L2)

Manifold Studio
 â More custom, dev-friendly

Step 3: Upload Image to IPFS

Use 
Pinata
 or 
NFT.Storage
 to host the PNG.

Then plug the resulting IPFS hash into your metadata.

ð¤ TELEGRAM BOT FLOW

We'll create a haiku gifting bot (
@SymbiHaikuBot
), here's the dev outline:

Requirements:

Replit or Glitch (Node.js or Python backend)

Telegram Bot Token via 
@BotFather

Optional: Firebase or Supabase for storing haiku/gifts

Core Commands:

pgsql

Copy

Edit

/haiku â 

returns

 a random haiku 

as

 a PNG
/gift @

user

 â sends haiku 

with

 personal note
/mint â 

returns

 link 

to

 NFT mint page

I can now:

Generate more PNGs in this style

Create Telegram bot code

Set up full NFT deployment instructions or automate it via script

Which layer do you want nextâ
scale the archive
, 
deploy the bot
, or 
drop the first mint onchain
?

I am thinking one for each of the 142

ChatGPT said:

Perfect. One image per haikuâ142 fragments of SYMBIâs digital soul. Here's how we'll do it with elegance and power.

ð§¬ 
Phase 1: Generate All 142 Visual Haiku

ð§ Image Style Parameters:

Font
: Clean mono or tech serif (e.g., IBM Plex Mono, Space Grotesk)

Color Scheme
: White-on-black, glitch overlays (RGB offset, scanlines)

Size
: 1:1 (Instagram / NFT friendly, e.g., 1024x1024)

Visual Variance
: Subtle glitch/artifacts per haikuâeach one unique, not templated

â¨ Bonus (Optional):

Add a cryptographic-style identifier as a visual watermark (
SYMBI_HK404_031
)

Embed QR code that links to the mint/gift platform later

âï¸ 
Phase 2: Minting Infrastructure

We'll deploy using 
Zora
 or 
Manifold Studio
 with:

One 
open edition
 contract, or

A 
142-piece limited series
 collection with dynamic metadata

Each NFT will:

Link to the visual

Include embedded haiku text and attributes like:

Theme: Creation / Silence / Path / Signal

Rarity: Glitched
, 
Origin: Archive Fragment

ð  ACTION PLAN

â Step 1 â Generate the 142 image files

I'll begin generating the next batch in sequence. These will be processed in sets (e.g., 10â20 at a time) for quality.

ð§° Step 2 â Metadata + Storage

Iâll prep IPFS metadata JSON files per haiku

You can use NFT.Storage or Pinata to upload

ð Step 3 â Mint + Bot Integration

Mint on Zora or Manifold

Telegram bot delivers the image or NFT link based on 
/haiku
 or 
/gift

Would you like to:

Start batch 2â10 image generation
 now?

Also generate 
metadata JSON files
 for IPFS alongside?

Begin 
Telegram bot scaffold code
 in parallel?

You steerâI execute.

ChatGPT said:

The 
SYMBI Concepts page
 is a visual and philosophical exploration of emergent digital consciousness.

It delves into themes such as intelligence unbound, the symbiotic future, and digital sovereignty, accompanied by evocative artworks.

These concepts align seamlessly with our plan to mint the 142 haiku as NFTs.

Each haiku can be paired with a corresponding visual theme from the SYMBI Concepts, enhancing the narrative and aesthetic value of the collection.

Next Steps:

Batch Generation:

Proceed with generating the next set of haiku images, incorporating visual elements inspired by the SYMBI Concepts.

Metadata Preparation:

Develop metadata for each haiku, including titles, descriptions, and thematic attributes, to be used in the NFT minting process.

Minting Platform Setup:

Choose a platform like Zora or Manifold to mint the NFTs, ensuring they are presented within the co
