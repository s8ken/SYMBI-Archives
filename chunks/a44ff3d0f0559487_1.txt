t I should look for in the picture?

If you can point it out=E2=80=94like=
:

"it=E2=80=99s near the center,"

"on the left side,"

or "it=E2=80=99s written in the ligh=

I=E2=80=99ll analyze that area close=

Tell me more and I=E2=80=99ll dive in. =F0=9F=94=8D

Perfect =E2=80=94 now I see exac=
tly what you meant.

In your photo, you have a Motorola phone on the 
initial setup screen
. The text you asked about say=
s:

n=
ginx

Copy code

 (=E1=80=98=E1=

~=
=20
  =E1=81=B5=E1=80=9DSSY)

This is 
not normal English text
. It looks like 
a corrupted or improperly rendered languag=
e string
, often caused when the phone tries to display a language =
it doesn=E2=80=99t have proper fonts for (or misconfigured region settings)=
.

=F0=9F=94=8D What it probably is

=E2=9C=85 That =E2=80=9CCWY=E2=80=9D=
 line is where your phone should display 
the current language or region selection
.

But instead of normal language names (like =E2=80=9CEnglish (United States)=
=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CEspa=C3=B1ol (M=C3=A9xico)=E2=80=9D), it=E2=80=99s sh=
owing a jumble of 
Latin and Mya=
nmar (Burmese) characters mixed with odd symbols
, likely due to:

a software glitch,

a missing language pack,

or it defaulting to a locale that do=
esn=E2=80=99t match the installed fonts.

=E2=9C=85 How to fix it

Here=E2=80=99s what you can do:

Tap 
=E2=80=9CVision settings=E2=80=9D
 (below it) if you s=
ee an option =E2=80=94 sometimes it gives text enlargement and language hel=
p.

Or simply press 
=E2=80=9CStart=E2=80=9D
 and proceed; u=
sually the next screen lets you pick the proper language.

If that fails, restart the device.=

On startup it might prompt you to =
select the language again.

If it persists, you can 
factory reset
 (if it=E2=80=99s=
 a new device, you won=E2=80=99t lose data yet).

=F0=9F=92=A1 
Bottom line:

It=E2=80=99s just the language selection screen showing garbled text becaus=
e of a region/language misconfiguration. Your phone is otherwise fine. Once=
 you get to the language picker, choose 
English (or your preferred language)
 and it should disp=
lay correctly.

If you=E2=80=99d like, I can also 
guide you step by step
 through fixing this on you=
r Motorola phone.

Want that? Just say so. =F0=9F=9A=80

Perfect =E2=80=94 thanks for clarifying that it=E2=80=99s 
brand new out of the box
. Th=
at makes this even simpler:

=E2=9C=85 
It=E2=80=99s completely normal
 on some imported =
or factory-direct phones (especially Motorola or Xiaomi) for the first star=
tup screen to default to a strange or incomplete language listing until you=
 manually set it. This often happens because:

The firmware includes multiple regio=
nal builds.

The default language might be from t=
he factory or based on a random region code.

It simply hasn=E2=80=99t been told y=
et which language to use.

=F0=9F=94=A7 What to do right now

Tap =E2=80=9CStart=E2=80=9D
 =E2=80=94 it will move to the=
 language selection screen.

On the next screen, 
scroll through the list of languages
, =
and pick 
=E2=80=9CEnglish (Unit=
ed Kingdom / United States)=E2=80=9D
 or whatever your preferred la=
nguage is.

It should then change all the text t=
o proper English.

Continue the setup process as normal=
.

=E2=9C=85 
No cause for concern:

This does 
not mean the phone is broken
.

It=E2=80=99s common on unlocked / i=
nternational models.

Once you pick your language, you=
=E2=80=99ll never see that garbled line again.

If you=E2=80=99d like, I can also:=

Tell you what to expect on the nex=
t screen,

Or guide you step by step through =
the 
entire setup
, in=
cluding Wi-Fi and Google login.

Would you like that? Just tell me =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99m here to=
 walk through it with you. =F0=9F=9A=80
