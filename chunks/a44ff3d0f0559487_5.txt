=E2=9C=85 
Yep =E2=80=94 here=E2=80=99s exact=
ly how that works for your $HAUSPARTY launch on Solana (via pump.fun or sim=
ilar):

=F0=9F=AA=A9 The quick breakdown:

1=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 
Your main wallet
 (like Phantom, Solfla=
re, Backpack)

Holds your SOL for paying fees &=
 starting the token (about ~0.02-0.03 SOL on pump.fun).

Receives the initial minted tokens (=
or in pump.fun, it actually doesn=E2=80=99t =E2=80=94 it uses a bonding cur=
ve so 
buyers
 mint directly fro=
m the pool).

2=EF=B8=8F=E2=83=A3 
A burn wallet

If you were launching manually (via =
spl-token CLI), you=E2=80=99d mint your supply to yourself, then burn or re=
nounce authority.

But with 
pump.fun
 you 
don=E2=80=99t need to do that at all
. It automatically:

Burns the mint authority.

Locks the liquidity.

This means you (or anyone) cannot ru=
g it, and there's 
no second wal=
let required
 for burns.

=E2=9C=85 That=E2=80=99s why pump.fu=
n is so loved =E2=80=94 it does the 
burn + LP lock for you
, so you never have to manually handle =
a burn wallet.

=F0=9F=94=A5 So in your case with p=
ump.fun:

You 
only need your single Solana wallet
 (Phantom etc.) w=
ith some SOL in it.

The smart contract they deploy:

Locks the liquidity pool forever.

Burns mint authority on creation.

Starts a bonding curve automatical=
ly.

So after launch, it=E2=80=99s tota=
lly community-driven. You keep the party going by hyping it, streaming, and=
 building the memes.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Bonus: if you were d=
oing a 
manual launch
=

If you ever want to do it manually=
 (like using spl-token or Solana CLI), THEN you=E2=80=99d:

Create the token in your main wall=
et.

Mint the supply.

Send some to a liquidity pool.

Then 
send the mint authority to the Solana burn address
:

11111111111111111111111111111111

That=E2=80=99s the universal Solan=
a =E2=80=9Cnull address=E2=80=9D that eats it forever.

=F0=9F=AA=A9 Bottom line for $HAU=
SPARTY on pump.fun:

=E2=9C=85 
No extra wallet needed.

=E2=9C=85 Just fund your Phantom wallet with SOL, go to pump.fun, fill out =
your coin details, and you=E2=80=99re set.

=F0=9F=92=A5 Ready to get this rol=
ling?

If you want, I can:

Write your 
pump.fun description
 right now.

Or help you set up your wallet saf=
ely if you want me to double-check your process.

Tell me what you=E2=80=99d like to do next. =F0=9F=96=A4 Let=E2=
=80=99s get this haus shaking.

You said:

Okay okay and vector and moonshot?

Love this=
 energy =E2=80=94 let=E2=80=99s break it down real quick.

When you say 
=E2=80=9Cvector and moonshot=E2=80=9D
 you might =
be talking about either:

Name ideas / meme concepts
 for additional tokens you want=
 to launch (like 
$VECTOR
 o=
r 
$MOONSHOT
),

Or common degen slang:

=E2=80=9Cvector=E2=80=9D
 =3D momentum, direction (sometim=
es even a meme for 
=E2=80=9Csending=
 it hard in a direction=E2=80=9D
).

=E2=80=9Cmoonshot=E2=80=9D
 =3D a project that could 1000x=
 =E2=80=94 or go to zero. Total gamble, high risk, high reward.

=F0=9F=9A=80 If you=E2=80=99re thin=
king about 
launching multiple m=
eme coins:

=F0=9F=8E=AF 
$VECTOR

Meme it as 
=E2=80=9Cthe velocity of your bag=E2=80=9D
.

Could theme it around 
speed, graphs, or acceleration memes
=
.

=F0=9F=8C=95 
$MOONSHOT

The classic.

Meme it around 
rockets, hopium tanks, =E2=80=9Cwen lambo=E2=80=9D v=
ibes
.

=F0=9F=A7=B0 If you=E2=80=99re thin=
king about 
tools or platforms:

There are actually sites popping up =
called things like:

Moonshot bots
 on Telegram: that let you snipe new Solana =
tokens.

Vector analytics
: Some people use this term for tools tha=
t show =E2=80=9Cvector strength=E2=80=9D of buys vs sells on a token. (Not =
standardized.)

But since you=E2=80=99re building =
$HAUSPARTY on 
pump.fun
, it=E2=80=99s simpler =E2=80=94 you don't need anything fancy.

=F0=9F=AA=A9 Here=E2=80=99s how t=
o structure it if you want a 
=
mini ecosystem
:

perl
