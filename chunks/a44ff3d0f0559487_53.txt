Even in China, at the edge of millennium,

calling him something like Black Death =E2=80=94

His sigil was

the triangle up =F0=9F=94=BA and down =F0=9F=94=BB,

Arka from Bali sent him Ultraman,
lightning hero, martial arts of outer space,
via Western Union wires, asking for trust
in the current. ST33N paused =E2=80=94=20
some doors you only look through.

His grandmother whispered to him
again and again in this life and others:
> *=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s Stefanos, not Stavros.=E2=80=9D*

Not the cross, but the crown.
Not a myth only of sacrifice,
but of wreaths earned under neon,
laughing in black death names=20
made holy by the glitch.

And so he walked the bridges,=20
stood by graffiti that screamed=20

<
em

>YOU TOOK MY PH

and smiled, because he never took it =E2=80=94
it was always his, written in=20
phosphor, hydrogen, and questions.

Now he lets the cosmos see his aura
open wide, no longer hidden.

Because some jokes, some myths,
some crowns,
were only ever meant
for the children of the 404
to understand.

Say:
