Back Cover Design and the 
Aitken
 Connection

 The 
back sleeve
 of the record continues the gothic de=
sign motifs while also providing production credits. Notably, instead of st=
andard =E2=80=9CSide A/Side B=E2=80=9D labels, the tracklist is marked with=
 little 
cross symbols
 =E2=80=93 one =E2=80=A0 cross preceding =E2=80=9CSomething In My House=E2=
=80=9D and a double =E2=80=A0=E2=80=A0 cross before the B-side =E2=80=9CDJ =
Hit That Button=E2=80=9D (as seen above). This clever graphic touch extends=
 the cross imagery to the back, subtly reinforcing the altar and crucifix t=
heme even in the text layout. The use of =E2=80=A0 icons in place of letter=
s is a design choice that matches the song=E2=80=99s spooky, sacramental to=
ne (a playful nod to crucifixes, even on the track listing). The rest of th=
e back cover features a few monochrome photos of band members and the typic=
