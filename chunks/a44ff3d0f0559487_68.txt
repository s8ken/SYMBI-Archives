Beyond the credits, the back sleev=
e design itself complements the front=E2=80=99s themes. The typography is s=

 and the single title are printed in an angular, serif font =
that could be seen as slightly archaic or churchy (in line with the altar i=
magery). Small decorative flourishes like the crosses serve both as design =
and as thematic symbols. In summary, the back cover provides the factual de=
tails (song titles, credits, catalogue number) but does so in a stylized ma=
nner =E2=80=93 even here, crosses replace arrows or bullets one might norma=
lly see, and the 
Aitken
 name in the credits ties back to the letter =E2=80=9CA=E2=80=9D symboli=

While at first glance the single=
=E2=80=99s artwork is rooted in gothic and filmic imagery, there are subtle=
 elements that resonate with 
=
letters, geometric shapes, and personal mythology
 =E2=80=93 themes=
 of special interest in the user=E2=80=99s exploration. For example, the pr=
ominent inverted cross on the cover can be viewed through a typographic len=
s: an inverted cross resembles an upside-down 
=E2=80=9CT=E2=80=9D
 (or an inverted =E2=80=A0 sym=
bol). This flipping of a familiar letter-like form could symbolize the 
inversion of conventional meaning
 =E2=80=93 much as Pete Burns inverted norms in his persona. It=E2=80=99s =
as if the artwork is taking a traditional symbol (the cross, akin to a lett=
er T or a 
dagger symbol
) and literally turning it on its head to craft a new identity. In a per=
sonal-symbolic sense, Burns projecting himself in front of an inverted cruc=
ifix can be read as

The 
letter =E2=80=9CA=E2=80=9D
 itself emerges subtly i=
n this context. The surname 
A=
itken
 (printed on the back) begins with an 
A
, a letter which in its capital form is ba=
sically a 
triangle
 o=
r arrowhead shape. This is an interesting coincidence: the user=E2=80=99s f=
ocus on triangles and arrows can find a connection here. The capital =E2=80=
=9CA=E2=80=9D is often drawn as a pointed shape =E2=80=93 essentially a tri=
angle with a horizontal bar. In the 
Stock/Aitken/Waterman
 logo or text, one could see the =E2=
=80=9CA=E2=80=9D in Aitken as a stylized pyramid or peak. While this might =
not have been an intentional symbol by the sleeve designers, it invites int=

s an arrow pointing upward =E2=96=B2, signifying ascent or prominence (fitt=
