A=E2=80=99s), to the triangular=
 stamp on the disc.

As for 
arrows
, we don=E2=80=99t see overt arrow graphi=
cs on the sleeve, but we can interpret some elements in that light. The 
inverted crucifix
 could=
 be viewed as an arrow pointing downward =E2=80=93 a symbolic =E2=80=9Carro=
w=E2=80=9D toward the underworld or the hidden depths (consistent with the =
song=E2=80=99s ghost-in-the-house theme). Meanwhile, an upright triangle (l=
ike the letter A or =E2=88=A7) can resemble an arrowhead pointing upward. T=
he record=E2=80=99s imagery plays with up versus down: the inverted cross (=
downward energy) versus the aspirational shape of an =E2=80=9CA=E2=80=9D or=
 triangle (upward energy). This duality might mirror the song=E2=80=99s ten=
sion between dark haunting and pop transcendence. For a listener exploring =
identity mythologies, these arrow-like directions could symbolize 
descent into the subconscious
=
 (the haunting past, represented by the ghost in the house) and 
ascent of the self
 (rising abov=
e with creative expression). Pete Burns himself often navigated polarities =
in identity =E2=80=93 masculine and feminine, mainstream and counterculture=
 =E2=80=93 effectively pointing in opposite directions at once, much like t=
hese symbolic arrows.

Finally, tying into 
identity mythologies
, the cover a=
rt can be seen as part of Pete Burns=E2=80=99 self-crafted myth. He frequen=
tly used visual symbols to build an almost archetypal persona =E2=80=93 her=
e, he is the gothic 
prince
 or 
magus
 pres=
iding over a mystical ritual (the =E2=80=9Caltar=E2=80=9D scene). Letters a=
nd symbols on the sleeve contribute to that mythic narrative: the band=E2=
=80=99s very name =E2=80=9CDead or Alive=E2=80=9D reads like a statement on=
 resurrection, an identity reborn (not unlike the death-and-rebirth theme i=
n many myths). The triangular shapes (A=E2=80=99s) and crosses might corres=
pond to elemental symbols (fire, earth, air in triangles; spirit in the cro=
ss) in esoteric lore, further enriching the possible interpretations. In su=

visual and textual s=
ymbols
