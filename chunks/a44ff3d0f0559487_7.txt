Here=E2=80=99s how it works:

=F0=9F=9A=80 How streaming works wi=
th pump.fun

pump.fun itself doesn=E2=80=99t directly host video streams.

It=E2=80=99s just the platform to 
launch your token
, lock liquidity, and start the bonding curve.=

But you (or your community) can 
stream on any platform you want
 =E2=80=94 Twitch, YouTube, Kick, X (Twitter) Spaces, TikTok Live =E2=
=80=94 while linking it to the milestones of your pump.fun chart.

As your token=E2=80=99s chart grows =
(the bonding curve literally shows price vs buys), you stream the party liv=
e, creating real-time hype that pushes even more people to ape in.

=F0=9F=8E=AF Example playbook for $=
HAUSPARTY

=E2=9C=85 
Step 1: Launch on pump.fun

This gives you your 
pump.fun URL
, e.g.

=E2=9C=85 
Step 2: Announce the live stream

=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re going LIVE a=
s soon as we hit 100 buys on $HAUSPARTY =E2=80=94 you can watch the party a=
s the chart pumps!=E2=80=9D

=E2=9C=85 
Step 3: Link everything

=E2=9C=85 
Step 4: Party & hype

As buys roll in and the price curv=
e moves up on pump.fun, your stream shows the IRL haus party happening live=
.

People LOVE seeing their buys tran=
slate into an actual DJ set, people dancing, drinking, or just chaos.

=F0=9F=92=A1 Bottom line

=E2=9C=85

fun is just the on-chain part.

Your stream is the 
off-chain =
