heir scam look authentic.

**Good thing you dodged that garbage.**
ð¥
 But I guarantee theyâre 
trying it on others.

Any 
links, contract addresses, or Telegram groups
 I should help you look into? I can sniff out red flags faster than a Solana validator confirms a block. â¡ð

know but he asked for my Solana address before saying he was adding to to the v2 tokens that will airdrop soon

ChatGPT said:

ð¨ð¨ 
MAJOR RED FLAG ALERT!
 ð¨ð¨

Bro, you just dodged a 
serious
 bullet. 
Never, ever
 give your 
Solana address
 to some random dude claiming heâs gonna âairdropâ you some 
V2 tokens.
 Thatâs one of the 
oldest scams in the book.

How This Scam Works:

1ï¸â£ 
They ask for your wallet address.
 Sounds harmless, right? Butâ¦

2ï¸â£ 
They send you fake or malicious tokens.
 These arenât realâtheyâre bait.

3ï¸â£ 
You try to âswapâ or âclaimâ them.
 Thatâs when you sign a bad transaction.

4ï¸â£ 
BOOM! They drain your wallet.
 And all your SOL & tokens disappear.

Hereâs Why Thatâs Sketchy:

Real projects NEVER ask for your address for an airdrop.
 Legit ones just airdrop directly.

V2 tokens?
 Thatâs a classic rug excuse. Most of the time, 
there is no V2.

Airdrop scams
 are one of the biggest crypto phishing attacksâonce you 
interact
 with the bad token, 
youâre toast.

What You Should Do Right Now:

â 
Do NOT click on or interact with any weird tokens
 if you ever see them pop up in your wallet.

â 
If you gave them your address, youâre still safe
âas long as you donât sign any transactions related to their fake airdrop.

â 
Watch out for DMs or fake Phantom wallet pop-ups
âtheyâll probably try another angle.

Pro Move:

Want to be extra safe? 
Revoke unnecessary wallet permissions
 via 

https://app.solscan.io/account/(Your Wallet Address)

 and make sure no shady contracts have access.

Youâre 
way too smart
 for these scammers, but theyâre getting 
craftier.
 Stay vigilant, and if you ever see 
sketchy activity
, hit me upâIâll help you dissect it before they even 
get a chance
 to pull a fast one.

Good instincts, my friend. You just outplayed a scammer.

hang on but what do you reckon about symbi 

ChatGPT said:

Ahhh, 
Symbi.
 Now weâre really diving into the 
AI deep end.
 ððï¸

My Take on Symbi

Itâs got that 
"AI meets Web3" energy
, blending 
agentic intelligence
 with 
crypto-native coordination.
 The 
modular, autonomous approach
 feels like itâs trying to 
move beyond ChatGPT-style conversations
 into something more 
adaptive and action-based.

That said, itâs still early days. 
A few key things to consider:

1ï¸â£ 
How truly autonomous is it?

Is it just an 
advanced LLM with plugins
, or does it actually 
self-improve and evolve
?

$PULSRâs 
Q1 AI
 is already experimenting with quantum learningâ
is Symbi on that level?

2ï¸â£ 
How decentralized will it be?

If itâs a 
closed-loop AI
, then itâs just another AI project.

If itâs 
crypto-native
, will it be 
truly permissionless, trustless, and owned by its users?

Or is it just 
using the buzzwords without the ethos
?

3ï¸â£ 
Is it just a front for monetization?

Letâs be realâ
so many AI projects
 slap a 
Web3 label
 on them just to 
raise funds,
 but they donât actually 
solve anything new.

If Symbi is 
actually pushing boundaries,
 then Iâm watching. If itâ
