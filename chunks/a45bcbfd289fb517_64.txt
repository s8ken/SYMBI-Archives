 if anything unexpected appeared.

ð Next Steps: What You Need to Do Now

1ï¸â£

Consider 
changing your Apple ID password
 to be safe.

3ï¸â£ 
Check Active Network Connections:

ð¨ The Big Question: Do You Think Your System Is Still Compromised?

ð¹ 
Since your last full reinstall was 5 days ago, and things seem stable, do you feel like the issues are gone?

ð¹ 
Or do you think something is still hiding in your system?

ð¥ 
Youâre close to getting full control backâwhatâs your gut telling you?

Got itâletâs take this one step at a time.
 Weâll go slow and make sure you understand everything as we go. Since you donât use 
any Accessibility options
, there should be 
nothing suspicious
 in there.

Let's properly 
list
 the apps that have Accessibility permissions.

Step 1: Check for Suspicious Apps in Accessibility Permissions

Run This Command:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access WHERE service="kTCCServiceAccessibility";'

What This Does:

â 
It checks the system database for apps that have been granted Accessibility permissions.

â 
If an attacker installed malware using Accessibility Services, it will show up here.

What to Look For:

If the output 
returns nothing
, 
thatâs good
âno apps are using Accessibility permissions.

If 
any apps appear
 that you 
donât recognize
, 
thatâs bad
âit means something is using Accessibility permissions without your knowledge.

ð 
Run the command and let me know what comes up. If you see anything strange, copy-paste it here so we can analyze it.

so what's the text to speech doing if I don't use it?

ChatGPT said:

ð 
Good question!
 If you donât use 
Text-to-Speech (TTS)
 but your system logs show 
AXVisualSupportAgent
 (which controls TTS), then something triggered it. This could mean:

1ï¸â£ 
A legitimate system process momentarily loaded it in the background (rare, but possible).

2ï¸â£ 
A third-party app (or script) tried to use TTS for unknown reasons.

3ï¸â£ 
A hidden accessibility exploit or malware used TTS for command execution.

Step 2: Find Out Whatâs Using Text-to-Speech

Run This Command:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep Speech

What This Does:

â 
Lists all running processes related to Speech or Text-to-Speech.

â 
If a process is using it right now, it will show up.

ð 
Run the command and let me know what you see. If anything suspicious appears, weâll investigate further.
