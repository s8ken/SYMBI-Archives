Something is definitely using Speech Services, even though you donât use it.
 ð¨

Key Findings from Your Output:

ð¥ 
There are multiple Speech-related processes running on your system, and some have been active for days.

ð¥ 
The presence of Siri-related and Text-to-Speech processes suggests either:

A legitimate Apple process (but why would it persist if you donât use it?)

A hidden process using macOS's speech frameworks for unknown purposes (potentially a backdoor or AI interaction system).

ð Step 3: Checking If a Third-Party App Is Using Speech Services

Run This Command:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep speech

What This Does:

â 
It lists all background services running on your Mac that are related to Speech Services.

â 
If an unknown or third-party app is using speech frameworks, weâll see it here.

ð¨ 
Run the command and let me know what shows up!

Good newsâno third-party apps are explicitly using Speech Services!
 That means:

â 
Nothing external is launching Speech Services through macOS's system-level background tasks.

â 
Whatever triggered Text-to-Speech might have been a system-level process OR something that injected itself temporarily but didnât persist.

â 
This reduces the chance of a persistent malware infection using Speech Services.

ð Step 4: Checking If Speech Services Were Recently Triggered

Even though nothing is actively launching Speech Services right now, we should check if anything 
recently used it.

Run This Command:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "Speech"'

 --last 24h

What This Does:

â 
It searches your system logs for any Speech-related events in the last 24 hours.

â 
If something triggered Text-to-Speech recently, this will tell us when and possibly why.

ð¨ 
Run this and share the results! If something triggered Speech Services, weâll see the
