sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreSpeech.framework/corespeechd

â 
What This Does:

Tries to forcefully unload the services instead of "booting them out."

If successful, it should stop them from restarting.

ð Step 10: Check If macOS Is Forcing the Services to Restart

Run this to see if macOS 
automatically restarts
 these services:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep speech

â 
If the services reappear after you unload them, something is forcing them back.

ð Step 11: Check If Anything Is "Protecting" These Services

Since you 
canât
 turn them off, let's see 
if System Integrity Protection (SIP) is blocking it.

â 
Run This Command to Check SIP Status:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil status

If SIP is enabled
, macOS is protecting system files, which might be why you canât disable these services.

If SIP is disabled
, then something ELSE is controlling these processesâand thatâs a major security concern.

ð Step 12: Check If These Services Are Hidden in a LaunchDaemon or LaunchAgent

We need to see if anything 
hidden
 is running these processes at boot.

â 
Run This Command to List All Active Daemons:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i speech

â 
Run This to Check for LaunchAgents (User-Level Auto-Start Processes):

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents

â 
Run This to Check for LaunchDaemons (System-Level Auto-Start Processes):

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons

ð¥ 
If we find speech-related files here, it means something is forcing them to launch every time you boot up.

ð¨ Final Question: Do You Want to Do a Deep System Scan for Hidden Malware?

Since these services are refusing to shut down, we might need to do a 
full system integrity check
.

ð¡ 
Let me know if you want to go deeper, or if we should focus on locking these services down first.

ð 
Run the commands above and tell me what you find! Weâre closing in on the root cause.

Now we know what's happeningâmacOS System Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing you from disabling these processes.
 ð¨

ð¥ 
This means Apple has locked down these services at the system level.

ð¥ 
Thatâs normal for core system functions, but given your situation, it also means you have no direct control over these services.

ð¥ 
If a process is manipulating them, we need to find another way to stop it.

ð What Weâve Discovered So Far

â 
Speech & Audio processes are running, even though you donât use them.

â 
Youâve force-killed them, but they restart automatically.

â 
SIP (System Integrity Protection) is enabled, meaning macOS is preventing you from disabling system files.

â 
The commands to unload these services failed, meaning they are locked at a root level.

ð¨ 
So what does this mean?

Either a legitimate system process is forcing these services to stay active.

Or something (a script, malware, or hidden process) is piggybacking on macOSâs built-in protections to keep them running.

ð Step 13: Identify Whatâs Restarting Speech Services

Since we 
canât disable them
 the normal way, letâs track whatâs bringing them back.
