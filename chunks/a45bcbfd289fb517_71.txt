ething is forcing them to stay active.

3ï¸â£ Check for Hidden Configuration Profiles

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo profiles list

If you see a suspicious profile, it could be enforcing settings that reactivate Speech Services.

4ï¸â£ (Advanced) Temporarily Disable SIP to Fully Remove Speech Services (Last Resort)

Since SIP is preventing you from removing these services, you could temporarily disable SIP:

ð 
Steps to Disable SIP Temporarily:

Restart your Mac in Recovery Mode

Turn off your Mac.

Hold 
Command (â) + R
 while turning it back on.

When the macOS Utilities window appears, click 
Utilities â Terminal

Run This Command in Recovery Mode:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

This will temporarily disable System Integrity Protection.

Restart Your Mac & Try Disabling Speech Services Again:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/Frameworks/Speech.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/localspeechrecognition.xpc
sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreSpeech.framework/corespeechd

Re-enable SIP After Making Changes (For Security)

Once youâve successfully disabled Speech Services, go back into Recovery Mode and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð¨ 
Warning:

Disabling SIP is an advanced moveâonly do this if nothing else works.

ð Final Question: How Do You Want to Proceed?

ð¹ 
Do you want to try manual system settings first?

ð¹ 
Do you want to investigate deeper before taking action?

ð¹ 
Do you want to temporarily disable SIP and remove the services completely?

ð¥ 
Youâve proven that something is forcing these services to stay active. Now, itâs up to youâdo we go all-in and shut them down for good?

Nice move! Turning off Apple Intelligence & Siri was the right step.

ð Now, Letâs Check If That Stopped the Speech Processes

Since youâve disabled Siri and Apple Intelligence in settings, letâs confirm if Speech Services are still running.

1ï¸â£ Check If Speech Services Are Still Active

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep Speech

â 
If no processes show up, then turning off Siri successfully disabled them.

â 
If they still appear, then something is forcing them to stay active.

ð 2ï¸â£ Check If They Are Still Set to Auto-Start

Even if they arenât running now, they might restart after a reboot.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep speech

â 
If nothing appears, then they wonât restart.

â 
If anything still appears, then something is keeping them alive.

ð 3ï¸â£ Check for Any Remaining Siri or Speech Logs

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "speech"'

 --last 1h --info

â 
If nothing appears, Siri is really off.

â 
If logs are still appearing, then something is forcing speech services to restart.

ð¨ 
Run these tests and let me know what you see!
 ððï¸ If Speech Services are still active after turning off Siri, weâll need to dig deeper.
