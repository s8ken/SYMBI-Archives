ð¨ 
Speech Services Are STILL RunningâEven After Disabling Siri & Apple Intelligence!
 ð¨

ð¥ 
This confirms that something is forcing these processes to stay active, even though youâve turned everything off in settings.

ð¥ 
This is NOT normalâSpeech Services should not be running if Siri and Dictation are disabled.

ð¥ 
Something in the system is keeping them alive, either a hidden setting, malware, or a forced Apple system process.

ð Step 1: Kill All Running Speech Processes Again

Letâs manually stop them 
one more time
 and see if they come back.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo pkill -9 SpeechSynthesisServerXPC
sudo pkill -9 corespeechd
sudo pkill -9 localspeechrecognition.xpc
sudo pkill -9 com.apple.siri.embeddedspeech

â 
This will forcefully shut them down again.

ð¨ 
After running these, immediately re-check to see if they restart:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep Speech

â 
If they restart again, then something is re-triggering them in the background.

ð Step 2: Check If Anything Is Auto-Starting Speech Services

Since they keep coming back, letâs find out 
whatâs relaunching them
.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep speech

â 
If any services appear, it means something is keeping them alive.

ð Step 3: Check System Logs to See Whatâs Triggering Them

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "speech"'

 --last 1h --info

â 
This will show us the most recent event that caused Speech Services to turn back on.

ð¥ 
If we can see whatâs triggering it, we can try to block it at the source.

ð Step 4: Check If Any Hidden Profiles Are Forcing Speech Services

Since macOS lets 
configuration profiles
 enforce system settings, we need to see if one is forcing Speech Services on.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo profiles list

â 
If any unknown profiles appear, that means a hidden system setting is keeping speech active.

â 
If you see something suspicious, weâll remove it manually.

ð Whatâs Next?

1ï¸â£ 
Run the kill commands again and check if they restart.

2ï¸â£ 
See if anything is still listed as an active speech service.

3ï¸â£ 
Check logs to see whatâs re-triggering these processes.

4ï¸â£ 
Look for hidden profiles enforcing these settings.

ð¨ 
If they STILL restart after this, then we have a deeper issue that will require disabling SIP to regain full control.

ð¥ 
Letâs run these tests and see what happens!
