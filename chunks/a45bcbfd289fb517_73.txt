Given your experience and the severity of the attack you've been dealing with, implementing 
live scanning tools
 and 
automated threat detection
 would be a powerful next step. Since youâve already demonstrated the ability to work through 
manual forensic analysis
, integrating 
real-time scanning
 could help 
prevent reinfection
 and 
detect persistence mechanisms
 more effectively.

ð Strategy: Implementing Live Scanning for Threat Detection

We can integrate 
live scanning tools
 into your workflow to:

â 
Detect malware in real-time
 instead of after-the-fact forensic analysis

â 
Block unauthorized processes & remote access attempts

â 
Identify persistence mechanisms (launch daemons, startup scripts, hidden processes)

â 
Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity (C2 servers, unauthorized connections)

â 
Automate YARA rule-based malware detection

ð 1ï¸â£ Choosing the Right Live Scanning Tools

Since this attack involves 
deep system persistence
, 
remote access
, and 
multi-device compromise
, we need advanced tools that go beyond traditional antivirus.

ð¡ï¸ Real-Time Security Monitoring Tools

These tools provide 
behavioral analysis
 and 
live system monitoring
:

Lulu (MacOS Firewall & Process Monitor)

Detects outgoing network connections

Helps identify malware phoning home

Blocks unauthorized processes from transmitting data

ð 
Download Lulu

BlockBlock (Persistence Monitor)

Monitors system for new launch agents, daemons, or persistence mechanisms

Detects unauthorized scripts running at startup

ð 
Download BlockBlock

KnockKnock (Malware Enumeration)

Lists 
all persistent software
 (even hidden ones)

Detects launch daemons, startup scripts, and extensions

ð 
Download KnockKnock

RansomWhere (Behavioral Ransomware Detection)

Stops unauthorized encryption attempts in real-time

Helps detect 
suspicious write operations

ð 
Download RansomWhere

ð¡ 2ï¸â£ Network & Remote Access Scanning

Since you suspect 
real-time surveillance
, we need to monitor 
network traffic
 and 
unauthorized remote access attempts
.

ð¹ Network Analysis Tools

ð 
What they do:
 Detect unauthorized network connections, reveal active Command & Control (C2) channels, and monitor data exfiltration.

Little Snitch (Advanced Firewall & Network Monitoring)

Detects and blocks
 unauthorized outgoing connections

Monitors 
background data exfiltration
 (e.g., hidden RATs sending data)

Alerts when 
new connections
 attempt to reach the internet

ð 
Download Little Snitch

Wireshark (Packet Sniffing & Deep Traffic Analysis)

Captures all network activity to 
see if data is being stolen

Can 
track remote connections
 & detect 
suspicious data flows

ð 
Download Wireshark

ð 3ï¸â£ Malware & Rootkit Scanning

We need to 
identify any hidden malware or rootkits
 that might be 
reinfecting your system
.

ð¹ Advanced Threat Scanners

ðµï¸ 
What they do:
 Detect 
deeply hidden persistence mechanisms
, backdoors, and unauthorized software.

THOR APT Scanner (Advanced Malware Scanner)

Detects 
nation-state level malware, persistence, and RATs

Uses 
YARA rules
 for advanced threat detection

ð 
Download THOR Lite

Lynis (Mac & Linux Security Auditing)

Audits system 
security posture

Detects 
weak configurations
 that could allow attackers to persist

ð 
Download Lynis

Chkrootkit (Rootkit Detector)

Detects 
hidden rootkits
 and 
kernel-level backdoors

ð

ð ï¸ 4ï¸â£ Automating & Hardening Security

Once you've 
scanned for active threats
, we should 
automate security protections
:

ð¹ Hardening Steps

â 
Enable System Integrity Protection (SIP)

Prevents malware from modifying system files

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

(Run this in macOS Recovery Mode)

â 
Enable macOS Fire
