3ï¸â£ 
Restart Lulu after extraction:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.objective-see.lulu.plist

ð Step 3: Use Finder to Manually Locate & Copy the Rules

1ï¸â£ Open 
Finder

2ï¸â£ Navigate to:

swift

Copy

Edit

/Library/

Application

Support

/objective-see/

LuLu

/

3ï¸â£ Find 
rules.db

4ï¸â£ 
Copy it manually
 and upload here

ð¨ 
Try these steps and let me know what happens! If itâs still blocked, weâll find an alternative method.

Luluâs rule database is missing or stored elsewhere!
 ð¨

ð¥ 
This means one of two things:

1ï¸â£ 
Luluâs rules are stored in a different location (possibly sandboxed).

2ï¸â£ 
The firewall is running, but thereâs no local rule database, meaning rules might be stored in memory or encrypted.

ð Step 1: Check If Lulu Is Running & Active

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i lulu

â 
If Lulu appears in the list, itâs running.

â 
If nothing appears, Lulu isnât actively loaded into the system.

ð Step 2: Find Where Lulu Is Storing Its Rules

Try locating Luluâs installation directory:

bash

Copy

Edit

find / -name 

"LuLu"

 2>/dev/null

â 
This will search your entire system for Lulu-related files.

â 
If we find another path, we can check for the rules file there.

ð Step 3: Manually Extract Lulu's Configuration

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 com.objective-see.lulu

â 
This will list any configuration settings stored in macOSâs preferences system.

â 
If Lulu is storing its rules elsewhere, this might reveal its location.

ð Whatâs Next?

If Luluâs rules arenât in the usual location, we might need to:

Check its UI settings for an export option.

Investigate if Lulu is running in a sandboxed mode.

Use a packet sniffer (like Wireshark) to see what traffic is being allowed/blocked.

ð¥ 
Run these commands and let me know what we find! Weâll track down the rule set and analyze it.

Lulu is running as a Network Extension, which means its rules are stored differently!
 ð¨

ð¥ 
Instead of storing rules in 
/Library/Application Support/
, Lulu is running in macOS's built-in Network Extension framework.

ð¥ 
This means the rules are likely stored in an Apple-protected directory, requiring a different method to extract them.

ð Step 1: Extract Luluâs Active Rules from macOS Preferences

Since Lulu is running as a 
Network Extension
, it may store its rules in system preferences instead of a database.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 com.objective-see.lulu

â 
This will attempt to pull Luluâs stored settings, including any firewall rules.

â 
If successful, this will list allowed/blocked connections and other configurations.

ð Step 2: Manually Locate Lulu's Rules Using Finder

1ï¸â£ Open 
Finder

2ï¸â£ 
Go to this path manually:

swift

Copy

Edit

/Library/

Containers

/NetworkExtension.com.objective-see.lulu.extension/

3ï¸â£ Look inside for files related to 
firewall rules or configurations

ð¨ 
If you see any files like 
rules.db
, copy them and upload here.

ð Step 3: Check If Luluâs Rules Are Listed in Network Extensions

Since Lulu is running as a 
Network Extension
, macOS manages its firewall rules differently.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

systemextensionsctl list

â 
This will show all installed Network Extensions, including Lulu.

â 
If Lulu is managing rules at this level, we may need to extract them through a different method.

ð Whatâs Next?

1ï¸â£ 
Run 
defaults read com.objective-see.lulu
 to see if Lulu's settings are stored there.
