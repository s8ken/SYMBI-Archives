Subject
: Personal Workspace and Conversation Missing after Migration

Message Body
:

Hi OpenAI Support Team,

I recently migrated from a personal ChatGPT Plus workspace to my business workspace (same email address). I received a pro-rata refund, indicating my personal workspace subscription was canceled.

However, now I no longer have access to my personal workspace at all, and one important conversation from that workspace did not migrate over.

Missing Chat Details
:

Approximate Date/Time
: 
(Insert approximate date or date range)

Topic/Title
: 
(Insert topic or keywords about the conversation)

Could you please help restore access to my personal workspace temporarily, or otherwise help recover/export this missing conversation into my business workspace?

Thank you for your prompt assistance.

Best regards,

(Your Name)

ChatGPT said:

From the screenshot you've provided, it confirms you currently only have 
one workspace visible
 under your existing login (the dropdown at the top-left corner labeled 
ChatGPT
). There is no option visible to switch to your personal workspace, meaning your previous personal workspace has indeed been completely disconnected or deactivated after the migration.

â 
What this means clearly:

You have a single workspace (
business workspace
) now.

Your original personal workspace was 
fully removed
 as indicated by:

Pro-rata refund
 email you received.

Absence of the workspace in your workspace list/dropdown.

ð  
Recommended Immediate Action:

Proceed to contact 
OpenAI Support
 using the message I previously provided to request either:

Temporary reactivation of your personal workspace
, OR

Recovery/export of your missing chat conversation
.

This will be your best route to potentially recovering your missing data.
