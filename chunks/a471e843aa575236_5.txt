You said:

ok I suggest its unavailable due to migration which hopefully means the chat in question is still coming over

ChatGPT said:

Yesâthat's very likely the case.

Since you're the sole admin/user and you've recently migrated your account workspace, it's common for certain features (like 
chat export
) and some content (like your 
missing conversation
) to temporarily disappear or become unavailable due to 
migration processing delays
.

ð 
Recommended Immediate Steps:

Wait briefly
 (24â48 hours) for migration-related delays to resolve, as some data can take time to fully sync after moving between workspaces.

Regularly 
log out and log back in
 to your account to trigger updates.

Subject:

Chat Missing & Export Function Unavailable After Account Migration

ð 
Body:

Hi OpenAI Support,

I recently migrated my ChatGPT Plus subscription and conversations from my personal workspace to my business workspace. Both workspaces use the same email address, and I'm the sole administrator and user.

After migration, I received a pro-rata refund indicating my personal subscription was canceled. However, now:

One important conversation
 from my personal workspace is 
missing entirely
.

The 
chat export functionality
 I previously had available in my personal workspace is also no longer accessible in my business workspace.

Could you please:

Assist in locating or restoring the missing conversation.

Restore chat export functionality to my current business workspace.

Thank you for your prompt assistance resolving this issue.

Best regards,

(Your Name)
