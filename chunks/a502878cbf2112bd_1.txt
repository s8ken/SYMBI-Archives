fore the system sampled its activity. This is categorized as a "hang" event.

A few key points from the error log:

Process Hang:
 The 
TextEdit
 application stopped responding while processing a save operation (
NSSavePanel
 related functions).

Architecture:
 The system is running on macOS 15.3.1 (arm64e), which aligns with your M1 Mac.

Other Processes Active:

accessoryupdaterd
 (responsible for updating Apple accessories).

accountsd
 (manages user accounts).

adprivacyd
 (related to Apple's ad privacy framework).

AirPlayUIAgent
 (handles AirPlay interactions).

AirPlayXPCHelper
 (another AirPlay-related service).

Potential Issues:

TextEdit Hang:
 Could be caused by a temporary system slowdown, a file system issue, or conflicts with accessibility settings (which you previously suspected could be exploited).

AirPlay Processes Running:
 If you suspect unauthorized mirroring or AirPlay-based monitoring, the presence of 
AirPlayUIAgent
 and 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 might be worth investigating further.

Would you like to check logs related to AirPlay activity or verify system integrity further?

Let's start by checking for AirPlay-related activity and system integrity. Since you’re not familiar with Terminal, I’ll guide you step by step.

1. Check for Active AirPlay Connections

You can check if AirPlay is actively running on your Mac with this Terminal command:

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Open 
Terminal
 (you can find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal).

Copy and paste the following command and press 
Enter
:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPNetworkDataType | grep AirPlay

This will show if AirPlay devices are currently detected on your network.

If you see any suspicious devices, note their names or addresses.

2. List Recent AirPlay Logs

To see logs of AirPlay activity, use this command:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.AirPlay"'

 --last 1h

This will display AirPlay-related logs from the last hour. If you want to check for a longer time frame, replace 
1h
 with 
24h
 for the past day.

3. Check for Unauthorized AirPlay Receivers

If you suspect a hidden AirPlay receiver, check if your Mac is an 
AirPlay Receiver
:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active

If the result is 
1
, your Mac is 
acting as an AirPlay receiver
 (which might be unexpected).

If 
0
, it's disabled.

If you see 
1
 and you don’t recall enabling it, you can turn it off with:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

(You’ll need to enter your Mac’s password when running this.)

4. Scan for Mirroring-Related Services

Since you suspect device mirroring, check for processes that might indicate screen-sharing or remote control:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screensharing|airplay|vnc'

If you see any process other than 
grep
, let me know what appears.

Would you like help analyzing the results once you run these? If you see anything suspicious, I can help interpret what it means.

ChatGPT said:

Since the command returned 
no output
, it means your Mac 
does not currently detect any AirPlay devices on the network
. This suggests that no AirPlay connections are actively in use at this moment.

However, that doesn’t rule out past activity or potential hidden configurations. Let’s continue with the next steps:

1. Check Recent AirPlay Logs

Run this command to check AirPlay-related activity in the past hour:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.AirPlay"'

 --last 1h

If you don’t see anything, try extending the search to 24 hours:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.AirPlay"'

 --last 24h

2. Check if Your Mac Is Set as an AirPlay Receiver

Run this command to see if your Mac is acting as an 
AirPlay receiver
 (which could allow anot
