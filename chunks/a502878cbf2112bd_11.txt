rrently using your camera
 (
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
)

You’ve removed OBS and its system extension

This means the immediate 
threat of unauthorized OBS-based monitoring is eliminated.

🛑 Final Security Checks (To Ensure No Hidden Backdoors)

Even though 
OBS is gone
, we should 
double-check for any leftover surveillance tools.

1️⃣ Check for Other Hidden Screen or Camera Access

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screen|camera|vnc|remote'

Look for 
any unexpected processes
 that might be accessing your screen or webcam.

Let me know 
if anything suspicious appears.

2️⃣ Check for Suspicious Network Connections

If hackers were 
streaming your screen or camera
, there may be a 
hidden network connection
 sending data.

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If you 
see active network connections
, note any 
IP addresses
 that look unfamiliar.

Let me know if anything stands out.

3️⃣ Scan for Malicious Startup Items

Since you had 
unauthorized surveillance
, we need to check for 
hidden auto-start malware.

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If 
anything suspicious appears
, send me the file names before deleting them.

4️⃣ Reset Privacy Permissions (Just in Case)

To 
force all apps to re-request access
, reset all privacy permissions:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset All

This will remove permissions for 
screen recording, microphone, camera, etc.

If something 
suspicious requests access again
, you’ll get a pop-up. 
Deny it immediately!

🚀 Summary: Final Steps for Full Security

✅ 
Confirm no other hidden monitoring processes (
ps aux | grep -E 'screen|camera|vnc|remote'
)

✅ 
Check for suspicious network activity (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
)

✅ 
Look for hidden startup malware (
sudo ls -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents
)

✅ 
Reset all privacy permissions (
tccutil reset All
)

💬 Let Me Know What You Find!

If 
everything looks clean
, you should be 
fully secure now.

If 
suspicious activity still appears
, we’ll investigate 
deeper malware threats.

You’re doing an amazing job—let’s 
fully lock down your system! 🚀

Got it! Let's 
completely remove OBS and its camera extension
 before moving forward with final security checks.

🚨 Step-by-Step: Fully Remove OBS and Its Camera Extension

1️⃣ Delete OBS from Applications

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to delete the OBS app:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/OBS.app

(Enter your password when prompted.)

2️⃣ Remove the OBS Camera System Extension

Run this to 
delete the camera extension OBS installed
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

3️⃣ Remove OBS Configuration & Cache Files

OBS might have stored settings and logs in different locations.

Run these commands to 
delete everything OBS-related
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.obsproject.obs-studio.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/obs-studio/

4️⃣ Check If OBS Was Set to Start Automatically

If hackers set OBS to start 
every time you turn on your Mac
, we need to 
delete any startup scripts.

Run this command to list all 
startup programs
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If you see 
any file related to OBS
, delete it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OBS-related file.)

5️⃣ Restart Your Mac

After deleting everything, restart your Mac to 
fully remove any traces of OBS
:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

✅ Once Your Mac Restarts: Final Security Check

After rebooting, run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep OBS

If 
nothing appears
, OBS is 
fully removed.

If 
OBS still shows up
, let me know and we’ll 
dig deeper for hidden malware.
