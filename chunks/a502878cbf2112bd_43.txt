I'd want to do last 30 days 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Let's extend the search to the 
last 30 days
 to get a full picture of where the broadcasts may have been sent.

1️⃣ Search macOS Logs for Streaming Activity (Last 30 Days)

Run this command to look for any 
broadcasting or streaming activity
:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "broadcast"'

 --last 30d

If nothing appears, try expanding the search:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "stream"'

 --last 30d

🚨 
If you see URLs, IP addresses, or app names, send me the results.

2️⃣ Check for Streaming URLs in Browser History (Last 30 Days)

Safari (Live Streaming Links)

sh

Copy

sqlite3 ~/Library/Safari/History.db 

"SELECT url, datetime(visit_time/1000000-978307200, 'unixepoch') FROM history_visits JOIN history_items ON history_visits.history_item = history_items.id WHERE url LIKE '%youtube.com/live%' OR url LIKE '%twitch.tv%' OR url LIKE '%stream%' ORDER BY visit_time DESC LIMIT 50;"

Google Chrome (Live Streaming Links)

sh

Copy

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History 

"SELECT url, datetime(last_visit_time/1000000-11644473600, 'unixepoch') FROM urls WHERE url LIKE '%youtube.com/live%' OR url LIKE '%twitch.tv%' OR url LIKE '%stream%' ORDER BY last_visit_time DESC LIMIT 50;"

🚨 
If unfamiliar URLs appear, check if they are still active!

3️⃣ Check YouTube Live & Google Account History

1️⃣ 
Go to YouTube Live Dashboard
:

🔗 
https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard

Look for 
any past live streams
 you don’t recognize.

Check 
"Uploads"
 (recorded live streams may have been saved).

2️⃣ 
Check Google Security Activity
:
