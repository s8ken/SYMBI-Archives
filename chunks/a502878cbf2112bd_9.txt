s to Stop OBS from Running

1️⃣ Remove OBS from Screen Recording & Camera Access

Go to:

System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording

Find OBS and toggle it OFF

Do the same in 
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera

If OBS is listed under 
Microphone
, disable that too.

2️⃣ Kill Any Running OBS Processes

Run this command to see if 
OBS is currently running
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep OBS

If you see a running 
OBS process
, note its 
PID number
 and kill it with:

sh

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual process number.)

3️⃣ Uninstall OBS Completely

🔹 
Delete OBS from Applications:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/OBS.app

🔹 
Delete the OBS Camera System Extension:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

This removes the 
OBS camera extension
 that might be used for broadcasting.

🔹 
Delete OBS Configuration Files (if any exist):

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.obsproject.obs-studio.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/obs-studio/

4️⃣ Check If OBS is Set to Start Automatically

To see if OBS is 
launching at startup
, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If 
OBS appears in the list
, delete the related file with:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OBS startup file.)

5️⃣ Restart Your Mac

After removing OBS, restart your Mac to ensure 
it doesn’t reload from memory.

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

🚨 If OBS Is Not Listed Under Camera, But Has a Camera Extension

Since you 
found an OBS camera system extension
, but 
OBS is not listed under "Camera" in System Settings
, this could mean:

OBS was manually granted access but removed from settings after installation.

Hackers could have installed OBS and used its system extension to bypass macOS privacy settings.

OBS might still be running in the background without your knowledge.

🛑 Next Steps to Confirm If OBS Is Active

1️⃣ Check If OBS is Running in the Background

Run this command:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep OBS

If you see any 
OBS-related processes
 running, 
note the PID number
 and kill them:

sh

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual process number.)

2️⃣ Check If OBS Is Using the Camera Right Now

Even if it’s not listed under Camera settings, we can check if 
any process is using your camera
:

🔹 
Run this command:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If 
OBS or another unknown process appears
, it is 
actively using your camera
.

Let me know what process appears in the output.

3️⃣ Uninstall OBS Completely (Even If It’s Not Listed)

Since OBS has a 
system extension for the camera
, 
we must remove it manually
.

🔹 
Delete OBS from Applications:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/OBS.app

🔹 
Remove the OBS Camera System Extension:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

🔹 
Delete OBS Configuration Files:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.obsproject.obs-studio.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
