Success! Your Vercel Deployment Completed Successfully!
 ð

Now, let's do a 
final check
 to confirm that everything is working:

â Step 1: Visit Your Live Website

Check the 
Vercel production URL
 that was generated in the deployment logs.

It should be something like:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//symbi.vercel.app

Try opening it in your browser!
 ð

ð Step 2: Verify Everything is Working

Does the homepage load?

No more 404 errors?

Does navigation work?

If your site uses API routes, check if they are responding.

â ï¸ Step 3: If Thereâs an Issue

If the website 
still shows an error
:

1ï¸â£ 
Try a Hard Refresh
 (to clear cache)

Windows/Linux:

CTRL + Shift + R

Mac:

CMD + Shift + R

2ï¸â£ 
Check Vercel Logs for Runtime Errors

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi.vercel.app

This will show if there are any issues running the app.

3ï¸â£ 
If you see any errors, copy them here
, and I'll debug them for you! ð¥

ð Final Thoughts

If the site works fine, 
youâve successfully deployed!
 ð ð¯

If anything is broken, let me know, and I'll help you fix it ASAP! ð»â¡

You said:

yeah I'm still getting the 404

Alright, since deployment completed successfully but you're 
still getting a 404
, it likely means one of the following issues:

ð Possible Causes & Fixes for the 404

1ï¸â£ Next.js App Router Requires 
page.tsx
 at Root

Since you're using the 
App Router
 (from Next.js 13+), your 
home page must be in:

bash

Copy

Edit

app/page.tsx

ð¹ 
Fix:
 Make sure this file exists and contains a simple component:

tsx

Copy

Edit

export

default
