upgrade any insecure packages.

ð  Step 2: Run Your Site Locally

Now, start the development server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

or, if using 
Yarn
:

bash

Copy

Edit

yarn dev

â If successful, you should see:

arduino

Copy

Edit

Local: http:

//localhost:3000

Open your browser
 and visit 

http://localhost:3000

ð 
Check:

No 404 errors

Styles and images load correctly

Console (DevTools) has no errors

ð  Step 3: If 
npm run dev
 Fails

Try clearing the Next.js cache
:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf .next
npm run dev

If any 
errors appear in the terminal
, 
send them here
, and I'll help debug.

ð Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

If your site 
works locally
, deploy it to 
Vercel
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed vulnerabilities and tested locally"

git push origin main
vercel --prod

ð¥ Final Check

â 
Localhost works
 (
npm run dev
)

â 
Vercel Deployment successful
 (
vercel --prod
)

â 
Website loads correctly
 on 
https://symbi.vercel.app

ð¨ Issue: "fatal: not a git repository"

Your project 
is not currently a Git repository
 because 
.git
 is missing. No worries! Let's 
reinitialize Git, commit your changes, and deploy to Vercel
.

ð  Step 1: Reinitialize Git in Your Project

Run the following commands:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website  

# Ensure you're in the project folder

git init                          

# Initialize a new Git repository

git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git  

# Link to GitHub repo

git branch -M main                

# Ensure you're on the main branch

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories  

# Sync with existing repo

ð  Step 2: Commit Your Changes

Once Git is initialized, add and commit your changes:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Reinitialized Git and added project files"

git push origin main --force

ð This ensures your changes are safely pushed to 
GitHub
.

ð  Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

Now that your Git repository is set up again, deploy your project:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

If Vercel asks: "Set up and deploy 
~/Documents/symbi-ai-website
?"

Just 
press 
Y
 and hit ENTER
 to confirm deployment.

â Final Check

1ï¸â£ 
GitHub Repo Updated
 (
git push origin main
)

2ï¸â£ 
Vercel Successfully Deployed
 (
vercel --prod
)

3ï¸â£ 
Visit Your Live Website
 (
https://symbi.vercel.app
)

ð 
Try this now and let me know if you run into any issues!
 ð¥

If Vercel is asking:

"Set up and deploy 
~/Documents/symbi-ai-website
?" (Y/n)

â 
Answer 
N
 (No)
 because we have already linked your project to GitHub.

ð  What to Do Instead

Since 
Vercel already has your project linked
, let's make sure it's properly set up:

1ï¸â£ 
Exit the Vercel prompt
 (press 
CTRL + C
 if needed).

2ï¸â£ 
Ensure your Git repository is set up correctly:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website
git status  

# Check if Git is tracking changes

If Git shows 
untracked files
, continue with:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Reinitialized Git and added project files"

git push origin main --force

3ï¸â£ 
Now, deploy manually using:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

ð 
This will deploy your project using the existing Vercel setup without needing to create a new one!
