et it up correctly and push your code to GitHub
 before deploying to Vercel.

ð  Step 1: Reinitialize Git in Your Project

Run the following commands 
inside your project folder
:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website  

# Ensure you're in the project folder

git init                          

# Initialize Git

git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git  

# Link to your GitHub repo

git branch -M main                

# Set the main branch

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories  

# Sync with existing repo

ð¨ 
If 
git remote add origin
 gives an error
, it means the remote is already set. You can check with:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote -v

If it's already connected, skip that step.

ð  Step 2: Add and Commit Your Changes

Once Git is initialized, 
stage all files and commit the changes
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Reinitialized Git and added project files"

git push origin main --force  

# Push changes to GitHub

â This 
ensures your code is safely stored in GitHub
.

ð  Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

Once your code is in GitHub, 
deploy your project
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

If Vercel asks:

"Set up and deploy 
~/Documents/symbi-ai-website
?"

â 
Press 
N
 (No)
 to avoid creating a duplicate project.

ð Final Check

1ï¸â£ 
GitHub Repo Updated
 (
git push origin main
)

2ï¸â£ 
Vercel Successfully Deployed
 (
vercel --prod
)

3ï¸â£ 
Visit Your Live Website
 (
https://symbi.vercel.app
)

ð¨ Fix: "cd: too many arguments" & Git Issues

Your terminal interpreted everything after 
cd ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website
 as part of the command. You need to run each command 
one by one
 instead of pasting everything at once.

â Step 1: Navigate to Your Project

Run this first:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website

â 
Now you are inside the correct folder.

â Step 2: Initialize Git (If Not Already)

Now, initialize Git inside the project:

bash

Copy

Edit

git init

If it says:

nginx

Copy

Edit

Reinitialized

 existing Git repository

That means 
Git is already set up
, and you can move to the next step.

â Step 3: Link Your GitHub Repo

If Git is 
not already connected
 to your GitHub repository, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git

To check if it's already linked, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote -v

If you see 
https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
, you're good!

If it says 
remote already exists
, 
skip this step
.

â Step 4: Sync with Your GitHub Repo

Now, fetch the latest changes from GitHub and 
merge them
 with your local project:

bash

Copy

Edit

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

ð¨ 
If you see merge conflicts
, Git will ask you to resolve them. Let me know if that happens.

â Step 5: Commit and Push to GitHub

After Git is properly set up, 
add and commit all your files
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Reinitialized Git and added project files"

git push origin main --force

â This ensures 
your project is now stored on GitHub
.

â Step 6: Deploy to Vercel

Once your code is pushed to GitHub, deploy it:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

ð¥ 
Try this now, one command at a time, and let me know if anything breaks!
