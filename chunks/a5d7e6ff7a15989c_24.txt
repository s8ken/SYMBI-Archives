Issue: Vercel Can't Find the Deployment
 ð¨

This happens when the project is deployed under a different URL than 

symbi.vercel.app

. Let's find the 
correct deployment URL and check the logs properly.
 ð

ð  Step 1: Find the Correct Deployment URL

Since your deployment 
completed successfully
, your site was likely deployed under a different auto-generated URL.

1ï¸â£ 
Check your last Vercel deployment log output

Look for a URL that looks like:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//symbi-6fyfo6rib-symbi.vercel.app

Copy 
that URL
 and test it in your browser.

2ï¸â£ 
If you donât remember the URL
, list your deployments:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel 

ls

This will show all past deployments.

Look for the 
most recent one
 and use that URL.

ð  Step 2: Get Logs for the Correct Deployment

Once you have the 
correct deployment URL
, check the logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

For example:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi-6fyfo6rib-symbi.vercel.app

ð Step 3: Check If Your Website is Live

1ï¸â£ 
Go to your Vercel dashboard:

â¡ï¸ 
Vercel Projects

2ï¸â£ 
Click on your "Symbi" project

3ï¸â£ 
Find the latest deployment & test the URL

â Next Steps

If your site 
works
, youâre all set! ð

If you still see a 
404
, let me know what URL youâre using & what logs say. ð¥

Got it! Vercel is now 
streaming runtime logs
 instead of build logs. Let's troubleshoot this properly. ð

ð  Step 1: Get Full Build Logs

Since Vercel changed how logs are displayed, use this command to see full 
build logs
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel inspect --logs symbi-e3tqckk7r-symbi.vercel.app

ð¹ This will show 
any errors that happened during deployment
.

ð  Step 2: Check If Your Site is Running

1ï¸â£ Open your site:

â¡ï¸ 
https://symbi-two.vercel.app

2ï¸â£ If you 
still see a 404 error
, try:

Hard refresh
 (
CMD + Shift + R
 or 
CTRL + Shift + R
)

Try a private/incognito window

Check console errors in DevTools (
F12
 â Console)

ð  Step 3: Manually Check Logs on Vercel Dashboard

1ï¸â£ 
Go to your project on Vercel:

â¡ï¸ 
Vercel Projects

2ï¸â£ Click on your 
Symbi
 project

3ï¸â£ Check the 
latest deployment logs

â Next Steps

If 

vercel inspect --logs

 shows an error, send me the log output! ð¥

If the site still shows 
404
, confirm 
page.tsx
 exists in 
app/
.

If 
everything is working
, ð YOU DID IT! ð

Let me know what you find! ðð¥
