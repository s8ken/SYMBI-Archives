ð Step 3: If the 404 Persists, Redeploy

If the 
site still doesnât load
, try a 
force redeployment
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

ð¹ This ensures Vercel 
doesnât use old cached builds
.

â Final Confirmation

â 
Deployment completed with no errors

â 
Site is accessible

No 404 errors or broken pages

so I deployed straight out of v0.dev and it works that way https://v0-symbi-ai-website-7xvcqm.vercel.app

Awesome! Your site is live and working! ð

Your working deployment:

â¡ï¸ 

https://v0-symbi-ai-website-7xvcqm.vercel.app

 â

ð  What Happened? Why Did v0.dev Work?

You deployed directly from v0.dev
, which 
likely handled all the setup and dependencies correctly
.

It may have automatically 
configured your Next.js settings, environment variables, and routes properly
.

This means your 
Vercel setup via CLI might still need adjustments
.

ð¥ Next Steps:

1ï¸â£ 
Do you want to continue managing the project from v0.dev?

If 
yes
, you can keep deploying straight from v0.dev without needing CLI.

If 
no
, we should fix your local setup so it works directly from your local machine & GitHub.

2ï¸â£ 
If you want to deploy from GitHub/Vercel CLI:

We need to 
compare the working v0.dev project with your local setup
.

Check for differences in
:

next.config.mjs

package.json

Folder structure (
app/page.tsx
, etc.)

Fix any missing configs.

ð Final Confirmation

â 
Your site is LIVE and working

â 
Do you want to keep using v0.dev, or do you want local CLI deployment to work?

so we need to add chat functionality and this is only a coming soon page so if we use v0.dev do we have less control?

ð¥ Adding Chat Functionality & Control Considerations (v0.dev vs Local Development)

Now that your 
"Coming Soon" page is live
, letâs decide how to 
add chat functionality
 and 
where to manage development
:

ð¹ Option 1: Continue Using v0.dev (Less Control, Easier Setup)

â 
Pros
:

No local setup required
âall development happens in the browser.

Quick iterations & easy deployments
 (v0.dev auto-syncs with Vercel).

Works well for static pages & simple components
.

â 
Cons
:

Less control over backend/API features
 (like WebSockets for real-time chat).

Harder to manage custom server logic, authentication, or databases
.

If v0.dev limits customization in the future, youâre locked in
.

ð Best for:
 Simple front-end changes without deep backend customization.

ð¹ Option 2: Move to Local Development (Full Control)

â 
Pros
:

Full control
 over backend logic, API routes, and real-time chat.

Easier integration with external services
 (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or a custom database).

Can build a scalable, long-term system
 for chat & AI-driven interactions.

â 
Cons
:

Requires local setup & deployments
 (but weâve mostly fixed this already).

More responsibility
 for maintaining infrastructure (e.g., database, auth, etc.).

ð Best for:
 If you plan to add 
live chat, AI interactions, or real-time features
.

ð  Adding Chat Functionality

Regardless of 
where you develop (v0.dev or locally),
 youâll need a way to 
handle chat
. Here are three options:

1ï¸â£ 
Firebase Firestore + Firebase Authentication

Real-time updates using Firestoreâs database.

Handles 
chat storage, authentication, and live updates
.

Works great for 
simple chat systems
.

2ï¸â£ 
Supabase (Postgres + Real-time WebSockets)

Works 
like Firebase
, but with 
SQL-based storage
.

WebSockets allow 
real-time updates without polling
.

Easier
