This lets Symbi respond using an AI model.

ð Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Decide where to build (v0.dev or local development).

If real-time chat is required â move to local development.

If basic UI updates are enough â stay on v0.dev for now.

2ï¸â£ 
Set up the "Manage" page.

Create 
app/manage/page.tsx
 (if using Next.js).

Add a 
basic chat UI placeholder
.

3ï¸â£ 
Integrate Symbi Chat.

Will it use 
real-time WebSockets
 or a 
REST API?

don't worry about the chat so much I just need to know which model we are using and figure out why I didn't work... so the v0.dev one just deployed does it also have a project in vercel?

ð Understanding v0.dev & Vercel Deployment

Yes, when you deploy from 
v0.dev
, it still 
creates a project in Vercel
. However, the setup might be 
slightly different from a manual GitHub/Vercel CLI deployment
.

ð  Step 1: Check if v0.dev Created a Project in Vercel

To confirm whether v0.dev created a separate project in Vercel, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel 

ls

This will list 
all projects linked to your Vercel account
.

Look for something like:

Copy

Edit

v0-symbi-ai-website-7xvcqm

ð¹ If it appears, then 
v0.dev created its own deployment in Vercel
.

Alternatively, go to 

Vercel Dashboard

 and check your projects manually.

ð  Step 2: Compare v0.dev vs. Your CLI Deployed Project

If 
v0.dev deployed successfully
, but your CLI deployment didnât, there might be differences in:

1ï¸â£ Project Settings

Open 
Vercel Dashboard
 â Select your 
v0.dev deployment project

Compare it with your manually deployed project

Check settings like:

Environment Variables

Build Command (Is v0.dev using a different one?)

Output Directory

2ï¸â£ Framework Preset

v0.dev might have 
automatically set a Next.js preset
 in Vercel.

In 
Vercel Dashboard â Settings â General
, see if your manually deployed project is 
using the same preset
 as the v0.dev deployment.

3ï¸â£ Differences in 
next.config.mjs

Open 
next.config.mjs
 in 
both
 deployments.

Does v0.dev have extra settings?

If missing, add them to your local version and redeploy.

ð  Step 3: Fix Your CLI Deployment

If your manual deployment still 
doesnât work
, try:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

If the issue persists, compare
:

Logs from v0.dev deployment
 vs. 
Logs from CLI deployment

Use:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel inspect --logs <deployment-url>

to check each one.

â Next Steps

1ï¸â£ Run 
vercel ls
 to confirm 
where v0.dev deployed
.

2ï¸â£ Check 
Vercel dashboard
 â Compare project settings.

3ï¸â£ Look at 
build logs
 for differences.

4ï¸â£ If needed, 
apply the same configs from v0.dev to your local project
.
