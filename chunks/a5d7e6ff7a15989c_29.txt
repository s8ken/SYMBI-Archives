ð Key Findings from Your Deployment Logs

â 
Your project deployed successfully

â 
Build was completed without fatal errors

â 
Deployment was finalized and pushed to Vercel

However, I noticed a 
major difference between this deployment and previous ones
:

ð What's Different in This Deployment?

1ï¸â£ 
Your project used 
bun
 instead of 
npm/yarn

bun install
 and 
bun run build
 were used instead of 
npm install
 or 
yarn install
.

v0.dev likely used 
bun
 by default
, while your manual deployments were using 
npm
.

Bun is faster
, but can introduce 
package resolution differences
.

2ï¸â£ 
React 19 Dependency Issues (Warnings, Not Fatal)

perl

Copy

Edit

warn

: incorrect peer dependency 

"react@19.0.0"

warn

: incorrect peer dependency 

"react-dom@19.0.0"

warn

: incorrect peer dependency 

"date-fns@4.1.0"

These are 
warnings, not errors
, meaning they didnât break the build.

However, 
previous deployments may have failed because of stricter npm package resolution rules
.

3ï¸â£ 
Next.js Version is Different

v0.dev used 
Next.js 15.1.0
, while your manual deployments may have been on 
Next.js 15.2.3
.

This slight version difference 
could affect the build process
.

ð¥ Why Did v0.dev Work but Not the Manual Deployment?

Possible Reasons

1ï¸â£ 
v0.dev Used 
bun
, Which Handled Dependencies Differently

Your manual deployment used 
npm
 (which may have been stricter).

bun
 is more forgiving with peer dependencies.

2ï¸â£ 
Slightly Different Next.js Version

Your local version might have required 
different configurations
.

We need to 
match your local and v0.dev's Next.js versions
.

3ï¸â£ 
Different Build Settings in Vercel

v0.dev 
may have applied automatic Vercel settings
.

We need to 
compare the project settings between v0.dev and manual deployments
.

ð  Fix: Match Your Local & Manual Deployment to v0.dev

1ï¸â£ Switch to 
bun
 Locally (If You Want to Match v0.dev)

bash
