ð¨ Issue: 404 Error After Deployment (Again)

Your build 
completed successfully
, but the site still 
returns a 404
. This means Vercel isn't finding the correct 
entry point
 for your application.

ð What's Causing the 404?

From the logs:

1ï¸â£ 
Next.js built successfully
 â No build errors.

2ï¸â£ 
Static pages were generated
 (
â prerendered as static content
).

3ï¸â£ 
But Vercel is not routing requests correctly
.

ð¨ 
The most likely issue:

page.tsx
 might be missing or not correctly structured inside 
app/
.

Vercel may not be set up to serve from the correct output directory.

ð  Step 1: Verify That 
app/page.tsx
 Exists

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 app/

It should output:

python

Copy

Edit

globals

.css  layout.tsx  page.tsx

â If 
page.tsx
 is 
missing
, you need to recreate it:

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 app/page.tsx

Then open it in an editor and 
make sure it contains a valid Next.js component
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

export

default

function

Home

(

) {

return

 (

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black text-white"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-3xl font-bold"

>Welcome to Symbi AI

</
h1

>

</
main

>

</
div

>
  );
}

Then commit and push:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Ensured homepage exists"

git push origin main
vercel --prod --force

ð  Step 2: Ensure Vercel Is Serving the Correct Build Directory

Check if 
next.config.mjs
 is correctly set up:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat
