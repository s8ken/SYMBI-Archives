â 
This fixes static exports and routing issues.

3ï¸â£ Switch to 
bun
 for Compatibility

Since v0.dev originally used 
bun
, weâll ensure itâs used properly.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install -g bun
bun install

â 
This installs dependencies the same way v0.dev did.

ð  Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

Now, letâs push the 
restored and fixed
 project to GitHub.

1ï¸â£ 
Initialize Git (If Needed)

bash

Copy

Edit

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
git branch -M main
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

2ï¸â£ 
Commit the Changes

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Restored v0.dev project and applied Vercel fixes"

git push origin main

ð 
Your latest fixed version is now in GitHub.

ð  Step 4: Redeploy to Vercel

Now, letâs deploy:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

â 
This deploys the restored v0.dev project with fixes.

â Final Confirmation

1ï¸â£ 
Check if your siteâs design is fully restored

2ï¸â£ 
Confirm that Vercel detects Next.js properly

3ï¸â£ 
If any errors appear, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

4ï¸â£ 
If it still fails, weâll compare Vercel settings with v0.devâs version.

You said:

do we need to switch or do you think it was being explicit that changed it - I notice that it still didn't have anything under framework

ChatGPT said:

Great observation! Since 
Vercel still didnât detect a framework under "Framework Preset"
, it means the 
explicit 
vercel.json
 file
 and 
properly configuring 
next.config.mjs

 were the key changes that fixed the deployment. 
We donât necessarily need to switch to 
bun
 if it was just a detection issue.

ð  Conclusion: What We Actually Need to Fix

Now that we know the cause, the plan is:

â 
Restore the original v0.dev project

â 
Ensure 
vercel.json
 explicitly defines Next.js

â 
Ensure 
next.config.mjs
 includes 
output: "export"

â 
Push everything to GitHub and redeploy

ð  Final Steps

1ï¸â£ Restore the v0.dev Project

Extract your original v0.dev project

Replace your current local folder with the extracted version

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website

mv

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-ai-website

Check that all v0.dev files are back

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -R

2ï¸â£ Add the 
vercel.json
 File (Explicit Framework Definition)

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 vercel.json

Paste this inside:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"version"

:

2

,

"builds"

:

[

{

"src"

:

"package.json"

,

"use"

:

"@vercel/next"

}

]

,

"routes"

:

[

{

"src"

:

"/(.*)"

,

"dest"

:

"/"

}

]

}

â 
This tells Vercel that it should treat the project as Next.js.

3ï¸â£ Fix 
next.config.mjs
 (Ensure Static Export)

bash

Copy

Edit

nano next.config.mjs

Make sure it contains:

js

Copy

Edit

export

default

 {

output

: 

"export"

,

trailingSlash

: 

true

,
};

â 
This ensures Next.js builds a static version of the site.

4ï¸â£ Commit & Push to GitHub

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Restored v0.dev project with explicit Vercel configuration"

git push origin main

5ï¸â£ Redeploy to Vercel

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

â 
This will now deploy the original v0.dev project but with explicit fixes for Vercel.

â Final Confirmation

1ï¸â£ 
Check if the site is restored with full styling and functionality

2ï¸â£ 
Verify in Vercel Dashboard that the deployment was successful

3ï¸â£ 
Confirm that "Framework Preset" in Vercel Settings is still empty, meaning we controlled the detection explicitly

4ï¸â£ 
If the site still breaks, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>
