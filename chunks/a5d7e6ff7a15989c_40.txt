Success! Your GitHub repository is fully updated!
 ð

Now, letâs 
redeploy to Vercel
 to confirm everything is working. Since 
vercel.json
 was deleted, weâll see if it was actually necessary.

ð  Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

This will:

â Deploy the 
working v0.dev setup

â Ensure 
Vercel detects Next.js correctly

â Fix the 
404 issue permanently

ð  Step 2: Check the Vercel Deployment

Once the deployment finishes:

1ï¸â£ Open the 
Vercel deployment URL

2ï¸â£ 
Check if everything looks correct
 (styles, components, UI)

3ï¸â£ 
Go to the Vercel Dashboard â Settings â Framework Preset

It should 
now say "Next.js"

4ï¸â£ 
If Vercel still doesnât detect Next.js
, check logs with:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs <your-deployment-url>

â Final Confirmation

ð 
Is the website fully working on Vercel?

â 
Any missing styles or components?

ð 
Did Vercel automatically detect Next.js?

ð¥ 
Try this now and let me know the results!

so we lost the look and feel in the same way as we did with our own fix but it also deployed successfully

Issue: The Deployment Worked, But Styling & UI Were Lost Again

Now that we 
confirmed Vercel deployment is stable
, we need to 
restore the v0.dev styling & components without breaking the deployment
.

ð Why Did We Lose Styling?

1ï¸â£ 
Files Were Overwritten or Deleted During Git Push

vercel.json
 was deleted (not a problem)

public/Symbi Logo.jpg
 was removed

bun.lock
 was removed

2ï¸â£ 
Some v0.dev-Specific Files May Not Have Been Committed

app/globals.css

app/page.tsx

tailwind.config.ts

components/ui/
 folder

ð  Step 1: Restore the v0.dev Styles & Components

Since the design worked 
before we pushed to GitHub
, we need to 
recover the v0.dev files
 and re-add them.

1ï¸â£ Restore the Missing Files

If you still have the 
original v0.dev ZIP
, extract and 
copy back missing files
:

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/styles ./styles

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/components ./components

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/public/Symbi\ Logo.jpg ./public/

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/tailwind.config.ts ./

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/globals.css ./app/

cp

 ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/page.tsx ./app/

(Adjust paths based on where the ZIP is stored.)

2ï¸â£ Check If 
layout.tsx
 Has the Correct Imports

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano app/layout.tsx

Ensure it includes:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

"../styles/globals.css"

;

import

"../styles/tailwind.css"

; 

// If v0.dev had custom Tailwind

â 
This makes sure the styles load properly.

ð  Step 2: Recommit & Redeploy

Now, co
