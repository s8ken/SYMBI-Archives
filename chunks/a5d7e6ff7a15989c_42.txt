ð¨ Issue: Files Still Skipped Despite Using 
--overwrite

Since 
shadcn
 is still 
skipping 5 files
, even with 
--overwrite
, we need to 
force a complete replacement
.

ð  Solution: Manually Overwrite the Files

Since 
shadcn
 isnât replacing them, weâll 
manually copy the v0.dev files
 and ensure they are used.

1ï¸â£ Restore Files Manually

If you still have the 
original v0.dev ZIP file
, extract and manually 
copy back missing files
:

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/layout.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/components/theme-provider.tsx ./components/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/globals.css ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/app/page.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/v0-symbi-ai-website/tailwind.config.ts ./

(Adjust paths based on where your v0.dev ZIP is stored.)

â 
This guarantees that we restore the correct versions of the files.

2ï¸â£ Verify the Files Are Restored

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

You should see the copied files 
listed as modified
.

If they 
do not show up
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -R app/ components/ styles/

If files 
are missing
, 
check that you copied them correctly
.

If files 
are present
, continue to commit and deploy.

ð  Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Manually restored v0.dev files for full UI"

git push origin main

â 
Now GitHub has the complete v0.dev version.

ð  Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

ð 
Now, the full v0.dev styling and components should be deployed successfully.

â Final Confirmation

1ï¸â£ 
Does the site now have the correct styling?
 â

2ï¸â£ 
Did all v0.dev files get restored correctly?
 â

3ï¸â£ 
Does the Vercel deployment work?
 â

ð Removing v0.dev Dependencies & Cleaning the Project

Now that weâve confirmed the 
core functionality and styling
, letâs 
remove v0.dev dependencies
 while keeping everything working.

ð  Step 1: Remove Any v0.dev-Specific Files

v0.dev may have 
extra configurations or files
 that are no longer needed.

1ï¸â£ 
Check for v0.dev-specific files
:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 | grep v0

If any files are found, 
delete them
:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf v0-*

ð  Step 2: Remove v0.dev References in 
package.json

1ï¸â£ 
Open 
package.json

:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano package.json

2ï¸â£ 
Check for any v0.dev-specific dependencies
 and remove
