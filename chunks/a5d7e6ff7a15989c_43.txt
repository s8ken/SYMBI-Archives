 working setup and ensuring a clean project. ð

ð  Step 1: Remove Any Unnecessary Files

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -R

Look for any unnecessary files that were auto-generated and remove them:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf unused-folder-or-files

(Replace 
unused-folder-or-files
 with any extra files you donât need.)

ð  Step 2: Ensure Only the Necessary Files Remain

Your project should have:

lua

Copy

Edit

app/
components/
styles/
public/

next

.

config

.mjs
tailwind.

config

.ts

package

.json

â 
If any required files are missing, copy them back before proceeding.

ð  Step 3: Verify 
package.json

1ï¸â£ 
Open 
package.json

:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano package.json

2ï¸â£ 
Check dependencies
 and 
remove anything unnecessary

For example, if extra UI libraries were added but not used, remove them.

3ï¸â£ 
After editing, save & reinstall dependencies

ð 1ï¸â£ Restore Files Manually (Ensuring the Correct Version)

Since 
shadcn
 skipped some files, we need to manually 
restore them from the last working version
 to ensure the site looks as expected.

If you 
still have the last working ZIP backup of your project
, you can 
extract and manually copy back
 the files that werenât overwritten.

bash

Copy

Edit

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/app/layout.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/components/theme-provider.tsx ./components/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/app/globals.css ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/app/page.tsx ./app/

cp

 -R ~/Downloads/symbi-ai-website/tailwind.config.ts ./

(Make sure to adjust the path based on where your backup is stored.)

â 
This guarantees that all key files are restored and match the correct styling.

2ï¸â£ Verify the Files Are Restored

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

You should see:

app/layout.tsx

app/globals.css

app/page.tsx

tailwind.config.ts

If any files 
are still missing
, double-check your backup and copy them again.

ð  Step 3: Commit & Push to GitHub

Once the files are restored:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Manually restored missing UI and styling files"

git push origin main

â 
This ensures GitHub is fully updated with the correct version.

ð  Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

ð 
Now, the fully restored version should be live with the correct styling.

â Final Confirmation

1ï¸â£ 
Does the site look as expected?
 â

2ï¸â£ 
Are all UI elements and styling correct?
 â

3ï¸â£ 
Is the Vercel deployment successful?

Perfect! The files have been restored, and Git detects the changes.
 Now, let's commit and push them to GitHub before redeploying to Vercel.

ð  Step 1: Commit & Push to GitHub

git commit -m 

"Restored UI layout and updated logo"

git push origin main
