nt from your local terminal!
 ð

ð  Step 3: Run Your Project Inside Codespaces

Once inside the Codespaces terminal (either via SSH or browser terminal), run:

bash

Copy

Edit

bun run dev

â If it works, your project is running inside Codespaces!

ð¥ Final Steps

If you just want to use 
the browser-based terminal
, no SSH is needed.

If you want 
to work from your local terminal inside Codespaces
, use SSH.

here's the issue I am describing https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/165416

Ah, I see the issue! 
VS Code in GitHub Codespaces is not displaying input in the terminal
, which is a known 
VS Code issue (#165416)
.

ð Fix for Codespaces Terminal Not Showing Input

Since you 
can't see what you're typing in the terminal
, try these fixes:

ð  Option 1: Restart the Terminal

1ï¸â£ Click on 
"Terminal" â "Kill Terminal"

2ï¸â£ Then open a new terminal:

Click 
"Terminal" â "New Terminal"

Or use the shortcut:

Mac/Linux:

Ctrl + Shift + 
 (Backtick key)

Windows:

Ctrl + Shift + 
 (Backtick key)

3ï¸â£ Try typing a simple command:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

â If the output appears, the issue is fixed.

ð  Option 2: Use a Different Shell (zsh or bash)

If the issue persists, switch to a different shell manually:

1ï¸â£ Open the 
Command Palette
 (
Ctrl + Shift + P
 on Windows/Linux, 
Cmd + Shift + P
 on Mac)

2ï¸â£ Search for 
"Select Default Profile"

3ï¸â£ Choose 
Bash
 or 
Zsh
 instead of the default shell

4ï¸â£ Restart the terminal and try typing again.

ð  Option 3: Open Codespaces in an Incognito Window

Some users have reported that 
browser extensions
 interfere with Codespaces.

1ï¸â£ Open a 
new incognito/private browsing window

2ï¸â£ Go to 
GitHub Codespaces
 and start your workspace

3ï¸â£ Open a new terminal and try typing.

â If it works, the issue was likely 
caused by a browser extension
.

ð  Option 4: Connect via SSH (Bypass the Browser Terminal)

If the 
Codespaces terminal remains broken
, connect 
from your local terminal using SSH
:

1ï¸â£ In GitHub, go to your 
Codespaces

2ï¸â£ Click 
"Connect" â "Connect via SSH"

3ï¸â£ Copy the provided SSH command (looks like this):

bash

Copy

Edit

ssh -i ~/.ssh/codespaces-key user@codespaces-abcdef1234-567890.github.dev

4ï¸â£ Open your 
local terminal
 (Mac Terminal, Windows PowerShell, etc.)

5ï¸â£ Paste the SSH command and connect:

bash

Copy

Edit

ssh -i ~/.ssh/codespaces-key user@codespaces-abcdef1234-567890.github.dev

6ï¸â£ Now, 
you can run commands inside Codespaces from your local terminal
 without dealing with the browser issue.

ð¥ Final Steps

Try restarting the terminal first
 (
Kill Terminal â New Terminal
)

Switch shells to Bash/Zsh
 if needed

Use incognito mode
 to rule out browser issues

If nothing works, connect via SSH
 to Codespaces from your local machine

no none of that works - honestly I kinda don't care anymore - this whole thing has told me this will no be a way to manage the website - I can't spend 10 hours a day on website alone

ChatGPT said:

I get itâthis has been a frustrating process, and it shouldnât take this long to manage a website. 
If itâs becoming too much of a time sink, itâs a sign that we need a more efficient workflow.

ð Alternative Solutions (Less Time-Consuming)

Instead of battling with Codespaces, Vercel, and deployments every day, here are 
faster, more stable ways to manage the site:

ð¥ Option 1: Use Vercel's Built-in GitHub Integration (No Local Setup Needed)

1ï¸â£ 
Push all changes to GitHub

2ï¸â£ 
Let Vercel auto-deploy from the repo

Instead of deploying manually (
vercel --prod
), 
Vercel can auto-detect updates and deploy automatically.

Set this up in 
Vercel Dashboard â Project Settings â Git Integration.

3ï¸â£ Now, you just 
push code to GitHub,
