and it goes live automatically.
 ð

â 
Zero need for local builds, Codespaces, or manual deployments.

ð¥ Option 2: Use v0.dev for All UI & Styling, Then Deploy via Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Do all design changes in 
v0.dev

 (since that part works smoothly).

2ï¸â£ 
Export the code
 â Replace the existing repo with the new version.

3ï¸â£ 
Push to GitHub
 â Let Vercel 
automatically deploy
.

â 
You never touch 
npm
, 
bun
, or local builds againâjust edit in v0.dev and push.

ð¥ Option 3: Switch to Webflow or Framer for No-Code Management

If this website is mostly static, tools like 

Webflow

 or 

Framer

 let you 
skip all dev work
.

They handle 
hosting, deployment, and UI
 without GitHub/Vercel complexity.

â 
No more debugging broken environments.

ð¡ Whatâs the Best Move?

If you 
want full control
 â Go with 
Option 1 (Vercel auto-deploy from GitHub).

If you 
want the easiest workflow
 â Use 
Option 2 (v0.dev for UI, GitHub for deployment).

If you 
donât want to deal with code at all
 â Consider 
Option 3 (Webflow/Framer).

okay so lets try number 1 with what we already have

Great! Letâs Set Up Automatic GitHub Deployments with Vercel (Option 1)

This will make 
Vercel handle deployments automatically
, so 
you only need to push code to GitHub
âno more manual deployments.

ð  Step 1: Connect Vercel to GitHub

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click 
"Add New" â "Project"

3ï¸â£ Select 
"Import Git Repository"

4ï¸â£ Find your repo (
s8ken/Symbi
) and 
click Import

5ï¸â£ 
Accept default settings
, then click 
"Deploy"

â 
Now, every push to GitHub will automatically trigger a Vercel deployment.
 ð

ð  Step 2: Confirm That Vercel Auto-Deploys

1ï¸â£ 
Go to your GitHub Repo

2ï¸â£ Edit a small file (e.g., 
README.md
)

3ï¸â£ Commit & push:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add README.md
git commit -m 

"Test Vercel auto-deploy"

git push origin main

4ï¸â£ 
Go to your Vercel Dashboard â Your Project

5ï¸â£ Check if Vercel automatically starts deploying.

â 
If you see Vercel building the project, auto-deploy is working!

ð  Step 3: Remove Local Deployment Commands

Since Vercel 
now handles deployments automatically
, you 
NO LONGER need
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

From now on, you 
ONLY push to GitHub
, and Vercel does the rest. ð

â Final Confirmation

1ï¸â£ 
Does Vercel deploy automatically when you push to GitHub?
 â

2ï¸â£ 
Does the live site match your GitHub version?
 â

3ï¸â£ 
No more manual 
vercel --prod
 needed?
 â

ð¥ 
Try these steps, and let me know if auto-deploy is working!

You said:

okay before I do that how do I test what we have in the GitHub repo directly?

ChatGPT said:

ð 
Great question! Letâs first test the current GitHub repo version locally before setting up auto-deployments.

This will ensure that 
the version in GitHub is correct and works before we link it to Vercel.

ð  Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repo to a Fresh Local Folder

To make sure your local version 
matches GitHub exactly
, start fresh by cloning the repo.

1ï¸â£ Navigate to your desired workspace directory:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents  

# Or wherever you want to store the project

2ï¸â£ 
Clone the repo from GitHub
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

clone

 https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git symbi-ai-website

3ï¸â£ 
Go into the project folder
:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi-ai-website

4ï¸â£ 
Check that you're on the correct branch (
main
)
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git status

â 
If it says "On branch main" and no uncommitted changes, you're good.

ð  Step 2: Install Dependencies

Now, install all required dependencies from 
package.json
:

bash

Copy

Edit

bun install  

# (If using Bun)

# OR

npm install  

# (If using npm)

â
