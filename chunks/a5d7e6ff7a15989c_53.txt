Fixing the 
ERESOLVE
 Dependency Conflict on Vercel

The error is caused by 

react-day-picker@8.10.1
 requiring an older version of 
date-fns

, but your project is using 
date-fns@4.1.0
.

ð  Step 1: Fix Dependencies Locally

Run the following 
on your local machine
 to fix the dependency issue:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

OR force install with:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --force

â This allows npm to 
ignore the version conflict
 and proceed.

ð  Step 2: Verify Dependencies Locally

Once installed, 
check the exact versions installed
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm list date-fns react-day-picker

â You should see:

sql

Copy

Edit

date

-

fns

@3

.6

.0

or

2.

x (compatible version)
react

-

day

-

picker

@8

.10

.1

If 
date-fns@4.1.0
 still appears, downgrade it to a compatible version:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install date-fns@3.6.0

ð  Step 3: Push the Fixed Version to GitHub

Once the dependencies are correct:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed dependency conflict for Vercel deployment"

git push origin main

â 
Vercel will now automatically deploy the updated version!

ð  Step 4: Trigger a Fresh Deployment on Vercel

If Vercel still fails, 
clear the cache and redeploy
:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod --force

Or manually delete the 
build cache
 from 
Vercel Dashboard â Project Settings â Redeploy
.

ð¥ Final Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Fix dependencies locally (
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
)
 â

2ï¸â£ 
Confirm correct versions (
npm list date-fns react-day-picker
)
 â

3ï¸â£ 
Commit & push fixes to GitHub (
git push origin main
)
 â

4ï¸â£ 
Trigger a fresh Vercel deployment (
vercel --prod --force
)
 â

ð 
Try this and let me know if Vercel deploys correctly!

why am I doing things locally - is this model avoiding that?
