re 
right to question this!
 The whole 
point
 of using 
Vercel with GitHub auto-deploys
 is to 
avoid needing local installations
 as much as possible.

However, the 
only reason we're troubleshooting locally
 is because 
Vercel is failing due to a dependency conflict
. If we 
fix it locally first
, we can 
push the correct setup to GitHub
, and 
never have to touch local development again
.

ð¥ Whatâs the Ideal Model?

â 
You make changes in GitHub (or v0.dev) â Push to 
main
 â Vercel automatically deploys.

â 
You should NOT have to manually fix things locally every time.

But since the current dependency issue is 
blocking deployment
, we need 
a one-time fix
 so future updates are smooth.

ð  Alternative: Fix It Inside Vercel Instead of Locally

Instead of fixing it locally, we can 
force Vercel to use legacy peer dependencies automatically
.

1ï¸â£ 
Go to Your Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ Select your 
Project

3ï¸â£ Click on 
"Settings" â "Build & Development"

4ï¸â£ Scroll down to 
"Install Command"

5ï¸â£ Change it to:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

6ï¸â£ Click 
"Save"
, then 
redeploy the project

â 
Now, Vercel will automatically handle this issue during deploymentâno local fixes needed!

ð¥ Final Steps

If you want to completely avoid local work
, set 
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
 in Vercel.

If you prefer full control
, fix it locally once, push to GitHub, and let Vercel handle future updates.

no - I am not happy at all - I want everything deleted in GitHub all projects removed from vercel and we start again with only what we have in 0.dev

Understood! Letâs Wipe Everything and Start Fresh with v0.dev

Weâll 
delete everything in GitHub and Vercel
, then 
set up a clean deployment
 using 
only whatâs in v0.dev
. This ensures 
no leftover conflicts or issues
âjust a fresh, streamlined setup.

ð  Step 1: Delete the GitHub Repository

Since weâre starting fresh, we need to delete the 
existing repo
.

1ï¸â£ 
Go to your GitHub repo:

ð 
https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi

2ï¸â£ Click 
"Settings"
 (âï¸ tab on the right)

3ï¸â£ Scroll down to 
"Danger Zone"

4ï¸â£ Click 
"Delete this repository"

5ï¸â£ 
Confirm the deletion
 by typing the repo name.

â 
Now, GitHub is completely wiped.

ð  Step 2: Delete the Project from Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Go to your Vercel Dashboard:

ð 
https://vercel.com/dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click on your 
Symbi project

3ï¸â£ Click 
"Settings"
 â Scroll down

4ï¸â£ Click 
"Delete Project"

5ï¸â£ Confirm the deletion.

â 
Now, Vercel is completely wiped.

ð  Step 3: Export the Code from v0.dev

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
v0.dev
 and load your project.

2ï¸â£ Click 
"Export Code"

3ï¸â£ Download the ZIP file to your computer.

4ï¸â£ Extract it into a 
new clean folder
.

â 
Now, we have only the v0.dev versionânothing else.

ð  Step 4: Create a New GitHub Repo

1ï¸â£ 
Go to GitHub â "New Repository"

2ï¸â£ Name it 
"Symbi"
 (or any name you want)

3ï¸â£ Click 
"Create Repository"

4ï¸â£ Open your terminal and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 path/to/extracted-v0-dev-folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m 

"Fresh start from v0.dev"

git push origin main

â 
Now, your v0.dev project is fully in GitHub.

ð  Step 5: Set Up Auto-Deployment on Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click 
"Add New" â "Project"

3ï¸â£ Select your new 
Symbi
 repo and click 
"Import"

4ï¸â£ Accept 
default settings
 and click 
"Deploy"

â 
Now, every GitHub update will automatically deploy to Vercel!

ð¥ Final Confirmation

1ï¸â£ 
Everything is deleted and clean
 â

2ï¸â£ 
Only the v0.dev version exists
 â

3ï¸â£ 
Auto-deployment is working with GitHub & Vercel
 â

ð 
Now your workflow is simple:
