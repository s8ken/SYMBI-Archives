Alright, weâre 
super close
âthe deployment linked correctly, but 

npm install
 failed
, which means thereâs a dependency issue. ð Let's troubleshoot and fix it step by step.

ð  Step 1: Check Vercel Logs

Since the error happened during 
npm install
, we need to 
see what exactly went wrong
.

Run this command:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel logs symbi-9g7uc67mc-symbi.vercel.app --all

This will show detailed logs about the error.

npm install
, let's

Copy

Edit

npm install

If this also fails, look for error messages and let me know what they say.

fails locally
