ð¨ Issue Identified: React Version Conflict ð¨

The deployment failed because 
React 
19.0.0
 is installed
, but some packages (like 
react-day-picker@8.10.1
) 
only support React 
16, 17, or 18

.

â Solution: Downgrade React to a Compatible Version

Since 
react-day-picker
 doesn't support React 
19
, we need to 
downgrade React to 
18.3.1

.

ð  Step 1: Fix React Version Locally

Run the following commands in your project root:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1

or if using 
yarn
:

bash

Copy

Edit

yarn add react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1

This forces your project to use 
React 18
 instead of 
19.0.0
, resolving the dependency conflict.

ð  Step 2: Verify Installation

After installation, check your React version:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm list react

It should now show:

css

Copy

Edit

react

@18

.3.1

ð  Step 3: Remove 
package-lock.json
 & 
node_modules
 (If Needed)

If there are still issues, reset dependencies:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install

ð Step 4: Commit & Redeploy

Once everything is working locally:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed React version conflict"

git push origin main
vercel --prod

ð Final Step: Check Your Deployment

Once Vercel finishes deploying, test your 
Vercel URL
 again.

Try this and let me know what happens! ðð¥
