n:

bash

Copy

Edit

vercel --prod

This will trigger a fresh deployment using the 
fixed dependencies
.

ð Step 2: Check Your Website

Once deployment completes, 
visit your Vercel URL
 (you'll get the link in the terminal) and check if it's working.

ð¡ Bonus: Verify Everything Locally

Before deploying, you can double-check that your site builds successfully 
on your machine
 by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run build
npm run start

If this works without errors, then the Vercel deployment 
should also work fine
.

â¡ Next Steps

ð 
Try 
vercel --prod
 now.

ð If 
any errors appear
, copy & paste them hereâIâll help debug!

â If the site works, 
we've won the battle!
