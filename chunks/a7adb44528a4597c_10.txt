This keeps your 
mythic heart
 intact, but it opens with=
 a plain one-liner and a simple framing section so even the most cautious s=
takeholder can instantly grasp 
wh=
y
 the page exists and how it aligns with SYMBI=E2=80=99s mission.

If you want, I can do the same kin=
d of treatment for 
Becoming.t=
sx
, so it=E2=80=99s also framed for both audiences. That way your =
two most =E2=80=9Cmystical=E2=80=9D pages are bulletproof for presentation =
but still magic underneath.

Want me to do that next?
