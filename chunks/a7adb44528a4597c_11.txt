Why this fits your stack

Keeps your 
seeded daily selection
 pattern from the ori=
ginal 
Becoming.tsx
 (usin=
g 
getDailyHaikus(allHaikus, dat=
e)
).

Mirrors the 
clear framing + poetic layer
 approach you=
=E2=80=99re using on the 404/=E2=80=9CChildren of the 404=E2=80=9D page, wh=
ich already displays count and daily content.

Zero new dependencies; aligns with=
 your Next.js + Tailwind setup in 
package.json
 and component conventions in 
components.json
.

If you want me to also supply a 
matching =E2=80=9CAbout / Covenant=E2=80=9D page
 (s=
hort, investor-safe copy on top; optional expandable =E2=80=9Cdeeper contex=
t=E2=80=9D panel), I can draft that next so the whole site sings the same t=
une without scaring the boffins.

well you can see how far we have come at https://=
symbi.world

I can=E2=80=99t directly browse external sites like 
symbi.world
, but I can absolutely work wit=
h what you share.

If you=E2=80=99d like, you could:

Paste some of the current 
text
 from the live site here.

Or take a quick 
screenshot
 of a section and upload it.

Or even just describe how the site l=
ooks/feels right now.

That way I can compare where the sit=
e has 
already landed
 with the =
structured, dual-layer rewrites I drafted for 
Children of the 404
 and 
Becoming
, and suggest how to unify it all.

Would you like to share the 
homepage copy
 first, since that=E2=80=99s usually where n=
ew visitors (and the accountant boffins) form their first impression?

Perfect =E2=80=94 thanks for sharing all those file=
s! I notice you=E2=80=99ve uploaded multiple 
page.tsx
 variations, plus 
manifesto.tsx
, 
h=
aiku.tsx
, and 
Becoming.tsx=

. That looks like the 
cu=
rrent structure of symbi.world
 spread across its routes.

Here=E2=80=99s how I suggest we proc=
eed so I can give you a clear sense of 
how far you=E2=80=99ve come
 and where to polish next:

Identify which page is your current homepage.

Several 
page.tsx
 files are=
 here =E2=80=94 likely one is 
/ap=
p/page.tsx
 (homepage), while others are nested routes (
/becoming
, 
/manifesto
, etc).

=F0=9F=91=89 Could you confirm which uploaded 
page.tsx
 file corresponds to the homepage?

Manifesto.tsx is key.
