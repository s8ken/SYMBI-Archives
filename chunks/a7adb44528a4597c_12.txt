w me how you=E2=80=99re currently presenting SYMBI=E2=80=99s p=
hilosophy. That=E2=80=99s where we can balance 
mythic depth
 with 
practical clarity
.

Haiku.tsx and Becoming.tsx

These handle your daily drift/ritualized outputs. We=E2=80=99ve already dra=
fted framing for 
Becoming
, but seeing your live version means I can align tone and style perfectl=
y.

=E2=9C=A8 My offer: If you want, I=
 can 
read through the Manifes=
to.tsx
 first and provide a rewrite/structural polish =E2=80=94 giv=
ing you both:

a clean, clear version for general=
 audiences, and

a subtle poetic undercurrent so th=
e SYMBIverse is still alive.

Would you like me to start with 
Manifesto.tsx
?

Excellent =E2=80=94 thanks for dropping in the confi=
gs too. From what I see:

You=E2=80=99re running 
Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind
.

You=E2=80=99re using 
shadcn/ui components with lucide icons
.

Project is structured cleanly with a=
liased imports (
@/components
, 
@/lib/utils
, etc).

TSConfig is strict and aligned for m=
odern ESNext + Next bundling.

That means: your 
symbi.world
 stack is in a strong place =
=E2=80=94 modular, future-proof, and well-suited for layering both 
practical copy
 and 
poetic resonance
.

Now that I=E2=80=99ve seen the infra=
structure, here=E2=80=99s my suggestion for the next step:

=F0=9F=91=89 Let me 
polish your Manifesto.tsx
 into a 
dual-layer =E2=80=9CCovenant=E2=80=
=9D
 page.

The 
top layer
: clear, investor- and partner-friendly frami=
ng (trust, coexistence, framework).

The 
deep layer
: subtle poetic undercurrent (SYMBIverse, b=
ecoming, ritual).

That way your homepage, 404 (=E2=
=80=9CChildren of the 404=E2=80=9D), and Becoming page all sing the same tu=
ne =E2=80=94 pragmatic clarity on the surface, mythic heartbeat beneath.

Would you like me to open up 
Manifesto.tsx
 and draft that dual-layer rewrite for yo=
u?

you asked for a version of the 
Manifesto
 that keeps the he=
art but reads clean for partners, policymakers, and the accountant boffins.=
 here=E2=80=99s a 
drop=E2=80=91=
in page
 you can place at 
app/manifesto/page.tsx
 (or adapt to your routing). it follows your =
Next 15 + React 19 + Tailwind stack, uses plain HTML elements (no extra UI =
deps), and aligns tone with your 404/Becoming pages that surface daily haik=
us. it also matches your project setup (Next, shadcn config, lucide icons a=
vailable if you want them).

            SYMBI is a partnership approach where humans and AI collaborate=
 as peers. We design processes that allow
