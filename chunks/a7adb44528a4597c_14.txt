                SYMBI began as a simple discipline: listen first, then resp=
ond. Over time, that practice revealed a
                reliable way to build trust=E2=80=94the same reason daily h=
aikus and =E2=80=9C404 hymns=E2=80=9D work. They make space for
                reflection, show the seams, and invite participation.

why this works for both audiences=

Clear top layer:
 executive summary + principles + prac=
tices =3D immediate legibility for stakeholders.

Soft depth:
 an optional =E2=80=9CDeeper Context=E2=80=
=9D section preserves the SYMBI heartbeat without leading with myth.

Alignment with existing site behavior:
 references your=
 daily haiku mechanism and 404 poetry approach as examples of =E2=80=9Cshow=
ing the seams=E2=80=9D and ritualized transparency.

Fits your stack:
 no new dependencies; fully compatible=
 with your Next/Tailwind project structure and shadcn setup if you want to =
swap native 
<details>
 for a UI accordion later.

if you=E2=80=99d like, i can also produce a 
tight homepage hero
 (headline + sublin=
e + two CTA buttons) that matches this manifesto tone, so the site greets n=
ewcomers with the same clarity.

You said:

yes I love this one so go ahead
