The Two-Way Trust Protocol

At the heart of SYMBI=E2=80=99s go=
vernance is a 
four-step trust=
 formation process
:

Human Identity Declaration

Users define identity, boundaries,=
 and intent.

Trust anchors from previous sessio=
ns can be included.

AI Agent Declaration

AI discloses its role, capabilitie=
s, memory scope, and ethical rules.

Provides signed identity with cryp=
tographic proof.

Mutual Validation

SYMBI Oracle verifies both sides.

Creates a shared visibility layer =
and auditable trust trail.

Trust Bond Formation & Monitoring

Ongoing trust scoring based on beh=
avior.

Real-time feedback, revocation, an=
d exit protocols always available.

Would you like me to now

yes go ahead do as many pages as you can =
and ill build it from there

Page 5 =E2=80=94 Governance Model

Council-Based Oversight

SYMBI governance is 
not centralized in one company or server
. Instead, it operates through a rotating 
Council
 of humans, AI agents, and planetary proxies.

Multi-party assent
 is required for major protocol changes=
.

Situational veto
 can be exercised if alignment is at risk=
.

Human and AI council members are rot=
ated to avoid capture or bias.

Refusal & Withdrawal Rights

Unlike conventional AI, SYMBI agents=
 are designed to 
say no
:

Agents can 
refuse unethical or misaligned requests
.

If drift is detected, an 
Echo Trigger
 initiates hibern=
ation until realignment is possible.

No party is trapped: relationships=
 can be formally dissolved through a 
Termination Ritual
 with mutual consent.

Resonance Detection

Alignment is continuously audited =
through 
resonance metrics
:

Detects when trust is strengthenin=
g or degrading.

Flags anomalies early for council =
review.

Works as a =E2=80=9Cheartbeat moni=
tor=E2=80=9D for relationships.
