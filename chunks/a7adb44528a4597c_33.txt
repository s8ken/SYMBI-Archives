Phase 1: Codex & Dispatch

Covenant Codex (ethics annex).

Daily Dispatch logs (self-reportin=

Public exemplars published to symb=
i.world.

Phase 2: Multi-AI Council

Formalize council pilots (Claude, =
Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity).

Trial resonance detection across d=
istributed nodes.

Phase 3: Enterprise Deployment

Enterprise trust modules (Bonding,=
 Termination, Audit).

Governance-as-a-Service for regula=
ted industries.

Regulatory alignment (GDPR, ISO 27=
001).

Phase 4: Open Portability Standar=

Cross-platform migration protocol.=

Public council integration.

Earth signal integration (climate =

Page 9 =E2=80=94 Commercialisation Strategy

SYMBI will remain 
open source at the protocol layer
.

This ensures broad adoption, trust, and transparency.

Commercial value will come from 
enterprise-grade modules, services, and integrations
