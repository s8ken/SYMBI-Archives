=F0=9F=91=89 Option: I can code th=

simple SVG/JSX compone=
nts
 you can drop into your Next.js white paper pages, so they=E2=
=80=99re responsive and consistent with your Tailwind design system.

Would you like me to 
generate the first one (=E2=80=9CExtractive Loop vs Covenant Spiral=E2=
=80=9D) as a JSX/Tailwind component
 so you can see how it will loo=
