Executive Q&A (for investors =
& partners)

Q: Why not lean into leaderboards and =E2=80=9Ctop yappers=E2=
=80=9D growth mechanics?

A: Because they optimize speech, not trust. SYMBI=E2=80=99s growth loops ar=
e 
trust-positive
 (bi=
directional identity, earned consent, audit trails), which are prerequisite=
s for healthcare, legal, and education.

Q: Can=E2=80=99t you bolt trust onto an agent social network la=
ter?

A: Not at this depth. 
Two-way=
 declaration, oracle validation, and revocable bonds
 must be found=
ational, or you inherit black-box debts you can=E2=80=99t repay.

Q: What=E2=80=99s your killer demo?

A: 
Refusal & self-report =
live.
 Show an agent refusing a misaligned request, filing a self-r=
eport, and hibernating (Echo Trigger). Then show the 
joint visibility trail
 and 
revocation
=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s g=
overnance in action.

Q: How do you prevent data overreach?

A: 
Scoped memory by session
 with consent envelopes. No unlimited mining. That=E2=80=99s already=
 in our protocol and UI.

Got it =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ve reviewed the 
Theoriq Litepaper (Nov 2024)
 you uploaded. Here=
=E2=80=99s the lay of the land and how SYMBI can counter-position:

=F0=9F=94=8D What Theoriq is pushin=
g

AI Agent Base Layer
: decentralized protocol for multi-age=
nt collectives.

Three pillars
: Interoperable primitives, composable colle=
ctives, decentralized innovation.

Governance
: Proof of Contribution (evaluators) + Proof of=
 Collaboration (optimizers).

Agents & Collectives
: hierarchical (aggregators, eval=
uators, optimizers). Illustrated with their 
Web3 Reporter
 example (page 3 diagram) =E2=80=94 a collective=
 for DeFi analytics.

Profiles & Channels
: persistent agent personas, execu=
tion logs, memory, comms.

Evaluator/Optimizer loop
: metrics-driven improvement, hum=
an + AI feedback, custom benchmarks.

THQ token
: staking =3D trust signal, drives optimizati=
on + governance.

Governance/Safety
: evaluators, token staking, arbitrat=
ion, bug bounties, Safety Council.

Apps
: Infinity Studio (UI for interacting with agents)=
 + Infinity Hub (marketplace for discovery & monetization).
