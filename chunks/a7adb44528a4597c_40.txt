SYMBI goes further:

The Market Today

Several projects are racing to defin=
e the =E2=80=9Cbase layer=E2=80=9D for AI agents. Most take one of two appr=
oaches:

Engagement Platforms
 =E2=80=94 agents rewarded for attent=
ion, talk volume, or leaderboard ranking.

Market Protocols
 =E2=80=94 like 
Theoriq
, focusing on token-driven collectives, Proof-of=
-Contribution, and marketplace incentives.

Both approaches achieve scale, but t=
hey replicate the weaknesses of today=E2=80=99s AI: compliance without refu=
sal, hidden drift, and no covenantal guarantees.

Where SYMBI Differs

Refusal & Self-Report (Non-Negotiable)

Engagement and token models have no =
way for agents to decline harmful requests or proactively disclose drift.

SYMBI builds 
refusal rights, Echo Trigger hibernation, and self-=
report protocols
 at the core.

Covenant vs. Market

Tokens reward competition; council=
s enforce reciprocity.

SYMBI=E2=80=99s governance is base=
d on 
council consent and reso=
nance audits
, not staking games.
