SYMBI includes 
Earth as a stakeholder

The Takeaway

SYMBI is not another agent marketp=
lace. It is a 
trust architect=
ure
: the only system where refusal, self-report, and planetary sta=
keholding are first-class.

Where others optimize for

, SYMBI optimizes for 
trust and coexistence

11 pages
: and this Competitive Landscape page neatly disarms =E2=80=9Ctop-yappers=

Would you like me to

 changed and why.

Backend Hardening

CORS Centralization: Consolidated CORS in backend/app.js with env-driven or=
igins.
Uses CORS_ORIGINS (comma-separated) or CORS_ORIGIN, plus localhost.
Allows all in development, explicit list otherwise.
File: backend/app.js:38
Strict Content Types: Limited to JSON and URL-encoded to avoid 415 confusio=
n.
File: backend/app.js:28
JWT Secret Enforcement: Removed unsafe default; requires JWT_SECRET (except=
 tests).
Files:
backend/controllers/auth.controller.js:10
backend/middleware/auth.middleware.js:12
Add Logout Route: Stateless POST /api/auth/logout to match frontend calls.
Files:
backend/routes/auth.routes.js:1
backend/controllers/auth.controller.js:79
Health/Readiness Endpoints: Restored /healthz and /readyz.
File: backend/app.js:100
Server Simplification + Socket Auth

De-duplicated server: Removed middleware, CORS, DB, and routes from server.=
js; app.js is single source of truth.
Socket.IO auth:
Verifies JWT on connection via auth.token or Authorization header.
Ownership check for joinConversation before joining room.
Emits both message_received and newMessage for compatibility.
File: backend/server.js:1
Data Security

API Keys Not Exposed:
ApiKeySchema.key is now select: false. Controllers avoid returning raw keys=
 on add/update.
Files:
backend/models/user.model.js:14
backend/controllers/user.controller.js:66
backend/controllers/user.controller.js:112
Deterministic Trust Scoring: Removed randomness from guilt_score for consis=
tent analytics.
File: backend/models/trust.model.js:94
Frontend Alignment

Socket Auth on Client: Passes JWT token when connecting; listens to both se=
rver events.
File: frontend/src/pages/ConversationDetail.js:1
Config

Env Example Updated: Adds CORS_ORIGINS and documents usage.
File: .env.example:1
