=8F Architecture & Design
Strengths =E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90 (5/5)
Excellent Modular Architecture
Clean separation of concerns across agent/, auth/, and monitoring/
Each module has clear responsibilities and interfaces
Well-defined type system with comprehensive type definitions
Agent Factory Pattern
Implements 8 specialized agent types (repository_manager, code_reviewer, te=
ster, deployer, etc.)
Template-based agent creation with validation
Pre-configured capabilities and permissions for each agent type
Convenient factory methods for common agent types
Comprehensive Type Safety
480+ lines of type definitions covering all domain models
Strong typing across all modules
No any types except where genuinely needed
Proper error type hierarchies
Event-Driven Design
Proper use of EventEmitter for monitoring components
Allows for reactive programming patterns
Good for scalability and observability
Areas for Improvement
Missing Dependency Injection
Tight coupling between some components
Recommend: Implement DI container for better testability
Configuration Management
Hardcoded defaults in multiple places
FIXED: Added .env.example template for environment configuration

Feature Coverage & Robustness
Core Features =E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90 (4/5)
1. Agent Management System
Score: 9/10
Strengths:
Factory pattern with 8 pre-built agent templates
Comprehensive validation system
Support for custom capabilities and permissions
Well-designed SDK for network communication
Clean API design with proper error handling
Implementation Quality:

typescript
// src/core/agent/factory.ts - Excellent validation example
static validateConfig(config: AgentConfig): { valid: boolean; errors: strin=
g[] } {
  const errors: string[] =3D [];
  // Comprehensive validation logic
  // Type-specific validation
  // Capability and permission validation
  return { valid: errors.length =3D=3D=3D 0, errors };
}

Areas for Enhancement:
No actual HTTP client implementation (SDK uses fetch but requires backend)
Missing retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
No connection pooling or request queuing
2. Authentication & Authorization
Score: 8.5/10
Strengths:
Custom JWT implementation (no external jwt library dependency) - src/core/a=
uth/jwt-helper.ts:193
Comprehensive session management with cleanup
Rate limiting built-in
Security event logging
MFA configuration support
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with 7 predefined roles
Security Audit Findings:

typescript
// src/core/auth/authenticator.ts:32
jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'default-secret-change-in-production'

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Security Concern: Default secret should throw error in p=
roduction
RBAC Implementation:
7 roles: super_admin, admin, agent_manager, developer, viewer, agent, servi=
ce_account
13 permission types covering all operations
Resource-level access control
Audit logging for all authorization decisions
Gaps:
No actual password hashing implementation (imports bcryptjs but doesn't use=
 it)
No token revocation store (in-memory only, lost on restart)
Missing refresh token rotation
Action Required: Implement persistent token blacklist (Redis/database)
3. Monitoring & Observability
Score: 8/10
Comprehensive Implementation:
Logger (src/core/monitoring/logger.ts:587 lines)
5 log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
8 specialized log categories
Multiple output targets (console, file, elasticsearch, cloudwatch, datadog,=
 webhook)
Structured logging with context
Log rotation and buffering
Child logger support for component-specific logging
Metrics Collector (src/core/monitoring/metrics-collector.ts:569 lines)
4 metric types: counter, gauge, histogram, summary
Built-in system metrics collection
Percentile calculations (p50, p95, p99)
Prometheus export format
Configurable retention and aggregation
Alert Manager (src/core/monitoring/alert-manager.ts:911 lines)
4 default alert rules (CPU, Memory, Task failure rate, HTTP errors)
Multi-channel notifications (email, sl
