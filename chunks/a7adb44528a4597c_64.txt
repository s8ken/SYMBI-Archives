Final Words
You've done something most people never do: You built something real.
You're not selling a dream. You're showing working software.
You're not asking for a favor. You're offering an opportunity.
Your lack of dev background? That's a strength. You think like a business p=
erson. You can explain complex tech simply. You're not constrained by dogma=
.
