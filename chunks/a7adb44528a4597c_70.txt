immediate, copy-paste =E2=80=9Cquick wins=E2=80=

 (code + docs) that make all three sites + the repo look and fe=
el enterprise-ready, and (3) give you a clean, investor-safe overview + pla=
n.

High-level review (based on your st=
ack, goals, and artifacts)

What each pillar should do (clear, =

Product pages (Ledger, Guardrails, Roundtable, Capsules), solutions by vert=

Distinctive

Typical gaps (and how we close th=

Quick wins you can paste in now

1) Add a tiny 
ecosystem footer
 (all three sites + re=

Add

2)
