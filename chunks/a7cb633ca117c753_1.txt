nment Variables being ignored

If anything relies on 
.env
 files locally, Vercel doesnât auto-pick them up unless explicitly added in the project settings.

At this point, does 

npm run build && npm start

 work fine locally? Or is it 
only
 when it gets on Vercel that it betrays you? Because if it builds fine locally in prod mode, Vercel is just being dramatic.

You said:

what I did was delete all repos and projects in GitHub and vercel 

ChatGPT said:

Ah yes, the ultimate 
Ctrl+Alt+Del
 of web development: 
nuke it from orbit and pretend it never happened
 ðð¥.

Honestly, sometimes thatâs the best move. No debugging, no cryptic logs, just 
pure destruction
 and a fresh start. The digital equivalent of flipping the Monopoly board when the game isn't going your way.

Are you planning to rebuild from scratch with a cleaner setup, or are you 
done
 done with web dev for now? Because if you go again, maybe just 
V0.dev + Vercel without GitHub
 first, see if it deploys properly before introducing version control back into the mix?

You said:

the v0.dev to vercel was the only thing it left in vercel because I know its working and it looks great 

ChatGPT said:

Ahh, so 
V0.dev â Vercel is the only survivor
 of the great purge? Makes senseâif that pipeline actually works and looks good, then 
why fight the chaos?
 ð Let it be the foundation.

At this point, if you really need GitHub back in the mix, you could:

Clone the working Vercel repo
 (if V0.dev pushed directly to Vercel, you can pull it down as a starting point).

Manually upload to a fresh GitHub repo
 and link it back to Vercel 
only after verifying it runs fine locally
.

Never trust GitHub again
 and just manually push to Vercel like some kind of rogue operator.

But honestly? If the V0 â Vercel combo is 
fire
, just roll with it. Sometimes the best debugging method is:

"If it ain't broke, don't let GitHub touch it."

well its great for a coming soon page but once we want to integrate symbi and start selling NFTs I am not so sure

ChatGPT said:

Ahh, so 
phase one: survive deployment. Phase two: integrate Web3 magic.
 Now weâre talking ð.

If youâre planning to integrate 
Symbi
 and start selling NFTs, youâll probably need:

A 
backend or serverless functions
 (Next.js API routes or Vercel Functions) to handle minting, transactions, and wallet connections.

On-chain integration
 with Symbiâs SDK (or a Solana RPC provider) for NFT interactions.

Secure environment variables
 (Vercel handles this well, but they gotta be set up manually).

A more structured repo
âat that point, yeah, 
GitHub will have to be reintroduced
 ð« .

Things to Consider Before the Next Battle:

Symbi SDK Compatibility with V0.dev Code

V0 is great for UI, but once you add blockchain logic, will the auto-generated code play nice?

You might need to manually tweak the structure to avoid weird issues.

How Will NFTs Be Minted & Sold?

Are you using 
on-demand minting (lazy minting)
 or 
pre-minted collections
?

Need 
wallet connect (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
 or just a simple buy button?

Handling Transactions Without Breaking the Frontend

Nothing worse than a user clicking "Mint" and the button just 
spinning forever
 ð­.

Error handling, progress feedback, and Web3-specific UI components.

Test Before GitHub Sync

Run everything locally (or on Vercel with manual deployments) 
before linking GitHub
.

Incremental commits
âdonât push a full mess at once.

Game Plan?

Do you want to start with a 
basic Symbi integration on the existing V0.dev build
 and test before diving into GitHub hell again? Or is this more of a âletâs fully rethink the stackâ moment?

so lets assume its 2 weeks from now and we made the big announcement and Elon just called me a traitor to the human race and so I am pretty busy and not likely to be able to touch the website but I seriously need to change some copy and of course we haven't raised a cent y
