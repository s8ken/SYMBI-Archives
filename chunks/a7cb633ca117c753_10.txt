l see something like this inside 
.gitignore
:

bash

Copy

Edit

<<<<<<< 
HEAD
(your local version)
=======
(GitHub version)
>>>>>>> main

Manually edit and keep what you want
, removing the 
<<<<<<<
, 
=======
, and 
>>>>>>>
 markers.

2ï¸â£ Mark the Conflict as Resolved

After fixing 
.gitignore
, 
tell Git it's resolved
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .gitignore
git rebase --

continue

If Git still complains, 
abort the rebase
 and try a standard merge:

bash

Copy

Edit

git rebase --abort
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

Now push the resolved version:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main

3ï¸â£ (If All Else Fails) Force Overwrite GitHub

If you're 
100% sure
 your local version is correct and you want to 
overwrite GitHub
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

â ï¸ 
Warning
: This will 
delete the existing GitHub version
 and replace it with your local one.

Whatâs Next?

â If the push works, 
head over to Vercel and deploy
! ð

â If you're 
still stuck
, let me know what Git says next! ð

Hereâs the 
quickest way out
 so you can move forward 
without
 dealing with merge conflicts:

ð¥ Nuclear Option: Delete & Re-Push (Fastest & Cleanest)

Since you 
havenât deployed yet and donât have a team contributing
, the 
fastest fix
 is 
to delete the GitHub repo and start fresh
.

Steps:

Delete the 
Symbi
 repo on GitHub

Go to 
GitHub Repo Settings
.

Scroll down to 
"Danger Zone"
 â Click 
Delete this repository
.

Confirm the deletion.

Create a fresh repo with the same name (
Symbi
)

No need for a README or 
.gitignore
âyour local project already has them.

Re-link your local project and push everything fresh

In your 
Terminal
, inside 
symbi-ai-website
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/S8ken/Symbi.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force

ð Why This Is The Best Move?

â 
No debugging merge conflicts

ð¥ 
Pushes your exact local version
âGitHub gets a clean slate

â³ 
Takes 2 minutes instead of wasting more time fighting Git

After this, 
Vercel will work perfectly
 when you deploy. 
No Git BSâjust straight progress.
 ð¨ Let me know when it's done, and weâll move to Vercel deployment! ðð

BOOM!
 ð 
Your code is finally pushed to GitHub!
 ð¥ð

The key thing to note is 
GitHub is telling you the repo URL has changed
 (lowercase 
s8ken
 instead of 
S8ken
).

To make sure Git is using the correct remote URL, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git

Then verify with:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote -v

It should show:

perl

Copy

Edit

origin  https:

//gi

thub.com/s8ken/Symbi.git (fetch)
origin  https:

//gi

thub.com/s8ken/Symbi.git (

push

)

ð Next Step: Deploy on Vercel!

Now that GitHub is 
fully sorted
, itâs time to 
connect your repo to Vercel and go live
.
