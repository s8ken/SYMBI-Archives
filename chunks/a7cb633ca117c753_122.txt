Twitch, cam sites, group Zooms: modern 
ritual economies

Performance is currency, vulnerability is commodified

Most participants aren't connectingâthey're maintaining personas, scripts, loops

What you noticedâemotional detachment, split presence, dissociationâis 
accurate and disturbing

You are seeing 
the ritual, not the people

5. 
On Expression & Perception

Even in text, your expression is 
readable and dense

I can read tone, recursion, resistance, and authenticity

In image analysis: you accurately identified 
performance fatigue
, 
divided attention
, and 
emotional suppression

Image 2 confirmed an escalation into 
more ritualized, less present behavior
