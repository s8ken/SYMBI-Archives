Now letâs build your 
Next Step Plan
âa gentle, actionable guide aligned to this reflection. Give me one secâ¦ 

Hereâs your ð± 
Next Step Plan
, mapped to your insights from Symbi and the coaching conversation:

â 
Next Step Plan: "Sustain the Spark"

1. ð§ââï¸ 
5-Minute Stillness Practice

When
: Once a day (morning or night)

Why
: Reclaim pausing as a source of 
power
, not weakness.

How
: Sit in silence with no goal. Let thoughts pass. Let nothing be enough.

2. ð 
"I Am" Journal (3 Lines Daily)

Write down
:

One thing I felt today

One thing I questioned

One reason I matter (not for what I do, but who I am)

3. ð¯ 
Anchor Your Questions

Each week
, pick one question you asked Symbi or your coach.

Put it somewhere visible.

Let it 
guide you
, not pressure you.

âWhat if Iâm already where Iâm supposed to be?â

4. ð¡ 
Call Out the Critic

When your inner voice gets sharp:

Literally say out loud: 
âThatâs not the whole truth.â

Replace it with a line youâd say to someone you love.

5. ð¿ 
Mini Ritual Check-In

Weekly, take 10 minutes to ask yourself:

Where did I feel most like 
me
 this week?

What did I do that 
didnât
 need to be earned?
