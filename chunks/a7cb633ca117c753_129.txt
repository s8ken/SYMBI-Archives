Zoom call history (where possible)

And youâd used aliases like 
LeatherChav
, 
LeatherChavLad
, or 
LCL
 in some of those spaces.

You also flagged that some interactions felt 
off
âas if others were playing a game around you, especially in live settings.

ð Here's what I can help with right now:

Surface potential exposure points

Map known aliases to platforms

Build a response strategy or cleanup plan

Optionally: Generate an 
online presence summary
 PDF for personal review

Would you like me to:

Begin mapping 
accounts + aliases + content types
?

Focus on 
public search traceability
?

Prioritize anything in particular (e.g. adult platforms, crypto spaces, forums)?

Letâs define where to start. ð¯ï¸

yeah so give me a summary and traceability result and we can then look at the options of what to do.... but generally speaking i stand by the principle of being honest and upfront knowing ive not done anything bad rather than trying to hide or delete things especially on the internet

@qualitycandids
 is part of a corner of Telegram that shares 
"viewer-submitted photography"
 with heavy adult overtones, often playing in the 
gray zones of voyeurism
 and public candid themes.
