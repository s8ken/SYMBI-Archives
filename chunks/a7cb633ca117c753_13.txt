git commit -m 

"Fresh start, no conflicts"

3ï¸â£ Force Push to GitHub

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u --force origin main

ð¨ 
This completely replaces the old repo.
 If there was anything there before, 
itâs gone
âbut I assume thatâs fine because the goal is 
getting this thing live
.

4ï¸â£ Redeploy on Vercel

Go to 
Vercel

Click 
Redeploy

ð¥ 
This wipes away the Git mess and finally lets you launch.
 Let me know when youâre live! ðð

SUCCESS!

GitHub is finally clean.
 ðð¥ 
Youâve officially won the war.
 ð

ð Next Step: Deploy on Vercel

Now that Git is 
fully reset
, letâs 
get this thing live
:

1ï¸â£ 
Go to Vercel
 â 
https://vercel.com/dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click on your project 
Symbi

3ï¸â£ Click 
"Redeploy"

ð¡ 
What to Expect?

If all went well, 
your site should now deploy successfully
.

If Vercel 
complains
, we just clear its cache and 
redeploy again
.

â ï¸ About That Security Warning

GitHub is warning you about 
1 moderate vulnerability
 in your dependencies.

If you want to fix it:
 Run 
npm audit fix
 locally and push again.

If you donât care:
 You can ignore it for nowâit 
wonât stop the deployment
.

ð¥ 
Go hit that "Redeploy" button and let me know if youâre LIVE.
