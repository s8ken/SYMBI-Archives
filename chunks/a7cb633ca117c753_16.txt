This is different because weâre controlling every step this time.

No broken dependencies from the start.

No Git merge conflicts.

No leftover junk from old installations.

That 
Replicate + Next.js guide
 is solidâitâs for integrating 
AI models into a Next.js app
, usually using Replicate's API for ML-powered features.

Are you looking to:

1ï¸â£ 
Follow that guide to integrate Replicate into your site?

2ï¸â£ 
Use it as a reference to fix your Next.js + Vercel deployment issues?

3ï¸â£ 
Something else related to AI models and Next.js?

can we use it for 2 and then look to integrate Symbi as not only the chatbot but to manage the site?

ð Game Plan: Fix Next.js + Vercel First, Then Integrate Symbi to Manage the Site

Alright, weâre flipping the script. Instead of fighting 
Vercel, npm, and Git
, let's 
rebuild the stack smarter
 using the 
Replicate Next.js guide as a base
âthen evolve it by integrating 
Symbi as the AI-powered site manager
.

ð¥ Step 1: Get a Working Next.js + Vercel Setup Using Replicateâs Guide

Instead of debugging a 
broken Next.js repo
, weâll:

Use Replicateâs Next.js template as a clean base

Deploy it successfully
 on Vercel

Then integrate Symbi on top

1ï¸â£ Clone Replicateâs Next.js Starter Project

Since your current repo has too much baggage, let's 
start fresh with a known working Next.js template
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

clone

 https://github.com/replicate/nextjs-examples.git symbi-site

cd

 symbi-site

rm

 -rf .git
git init

This gives you 
a clean Next.js repo
 without conflicts.

2ï¸â£ Link It to Your GitHub Repo

Since we 
deleted the old repo
, now we push this fresh project to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
git add .
git commit -m 

"Fresh start with Replicate Next.js template"

git push -u origin main

Now 
Vercel can pull from this clean repo without any dependency hell.

3ï¸â£ Deploy to Vercel

Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

Click 
"New Project"

Select your 
Symbi
 repo

Click 
Deploy

ð 
Now, you have a working Next.js site live on Vercel!

(Finally, no npm conflicts, no Git issues, no headaches.)

ð¥ Step 2: Integrate Symbi as the AI-Powered Site Manager

Now that we 
have a solid base
, we can start integrating 
Symbi
 to:

Power the chatbot

Manage site content dynamically

Automate deployments or content updates via AI

1ï¸â£ Add Symbiâs Chatbot to the Site

To 
embed Symbi
 as a chatbot on the site, we can:

Use a 
custom widget
 that integrates Symbi's API

Or embed it 
directly inside Next.js pages
 using React components

If Symbi has an API, you can install it in the project:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install symbi-sdk  

# Example if there's an SDK

Then, create a chatbot component:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { 

SymbiChat

 } 

from

"symbi-sdk"

;

export

default

function

Chatbot

(

) {

return

<
SymbiChat

 />;
}

Then 
import it into 
app/page.tsx
 or another page
.

2ï¸â£ AI-Powered Content Management

Instead of hardcoding everything, we can 
let Symbi dynamically update content
:

Symbi 
fetches updates via API

Site 
renders dynamic content without redeploys

Example API route:

tsx

Copy

Edit

export

async

function

getStaticProps

(

) {

const

 content = 

await

fetch

(

"https://api.symbi.ai/content"

);

return

 { 

props

: { content } };
}

Then 
use 
content
 to populate the homepage dynamically.

3ï¸â£ Automate Site Management with AI

To let 
Symbi control updates
, we can:

Let Symbi 
trigger site redeploys
 via GitHub Actions

Have Symbi 
modify copy, images, or layout dyn
