Example: A 
Symbi Admin Dashboard
 where you can tell Symbi to:

â 
Update homepage copy

â 
Swap featured NFTs

â 
Manage users & interactions

ð Recap:

â 
We cloned Replicate's Next.js template
 (so Next.js + Vercel works 
flawlessly
)

â 
We deployed it successfully on Vercel

â 
Now weâre integrating Symbi for AI-powered site management

ð¥ 
Now, letâs deploy it to Vercel & integrate Symbi.

1ï¸â£ Setup Your Local Next.js Project

Inside your project folder (
symbi
 repo), run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm init -y  

# Initializes package.json (if missing)

npm install next react react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

2ï¸â£ Make Sure the Folder Structure is Correct

Your repo should have:

python

Copy

Edit

symbi/
âââ app/
â   âââ page.tsx       

# Homepage

â   âââ layout.tsx     

# Global layout

âââ components/
â   âââ theme-provider.tsx  

# Theme manager

âââ styles/
â   âââ 

globals

.css    

# Tailwind CSS

âââ tailwind.config.ts  

# Tailwind config

âââ package.json
âââ 

next

.config.mjs
âââ .gitignore

If something is missing, move the files into the right places.

3ï¸â£ Push to GitHub

Once everything looks good, push it to 
your clean repo (
Symbi
)
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Clean Next.js + Tailwind setup"

git push origin main

4ï¸â£ Deploy to Vercel

1ï¸â£ Go to 

Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click 
"New Project"

3ï¸â£ Select 
your 
Symbi
 GitHub repo

4ï¸â£ Keep everything 
default

5ï¸â£ Click 
"Deploy"

5ï¸â£ If It Works: Time to Integrate Symbi!

Once 
Vercel shows "Deployed Successfully"
, we move to 
Step 2: Symbi Integration
.

Would you like Symbi to:

Power the chatbot only?

Manage the entire site dynamically?

Automate NFTs & AI-driven content?

You said:

well I was hoping to use replicate with that existing design 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! You want to 
keep your existing design
 but 
use Replicate for AI models
 while making sure 
Next.js + Vercel deploys smoothly
. â

ð The Plan

1ï¸â£ 
Ensure your Next.js + Tailwind project deploys on Vercel
 (we already prepped the files).

2ï¸â£ 
Integrate Replicate's API into your existing design
 (so AI models run smoothly).

3ï¸â£ 
(Optional) Let Symbi manage dynamic content or AI chatbot integration.

1ï¸â£ Deploy Your Existing Design on Vercel

Since you already have 
all the design files uploaded
, letâs just 
finalize dependencies and push to GitHub
:

ð Install Required Packages

Run this inside your project folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install next react react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install @vercel/edge-config

(Edge Config is optional, but useful if we want dynamic content updates later.)

ð Push Everything to GitHub

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Final clean setup for Next.js + Tailwind"

git push origin main

ð Deploy to Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Go to Vercel Dashboard
 â 
https://vercel.com/dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click 
"New Project"

3ï¸â£ Select 
your 
Symbi
 GitHub repo

4ï¸â£ Click 
"Deploy"

ð 
Once this is live, we move to Step 2: Adding Replicate!
