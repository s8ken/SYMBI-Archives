Ahh, yesâ
the dream scenario
 ð.

Big launch.

Elon beefing with you on Twitter (sorry, X).

Website locked in Vercel, but you gotta change copy fast.

No funding yet, so no fancy dev team to fix it.

You need a no-code, fast-edit solution that doesnât require touching GitHub or breaking the site.

Best Options Given the Chaos:

Vercelâs Built-in Edge Config (for text updates)

Vercel has an 
Edge Config feature
 that lets you store dynamic values (like text) without redeploying.

You (or anyone) can update the copy 
instantly
 from Vercelâs dashboard.

Downside? Requires 
setting up Edge Config now
, before the chaos begins.

Use a Simple CMS (Headless or Even Notion-Based)

Sanity.io
 (or even a Google Sheet) can act as a âsource of truthâ for website content.

Next.js can pull copy dynamically
, meaning no redeploys neededâjust edit in the CMS.

Or go full low-tech:
 Sync a Notion page to the site.

Keep It in V0.dev and Have a Non-Tech Person Update It

If the 
V0.dev â Vercel
 setup is still working, just 
let someone else handle updates in V0
.

V0 has a 
visual editor
âno need to touch code.

If All Else Failsâ¦ Just Edit Directly in Vercel

Vercel lets you 
manually edit deployments
 (hotfixing without redeploying the repo).

Not scalable,
 but a quick way to change a few lines.

If You Do Nothing Today (But Want to Avoid Pain Later)

ð¥ 
At least set up Edge Config or a simple CMS-like solution.

ð¥ 
Or assign someone access to V0.dev so they can edit instead of you.

ð¥ 
DO NOT rely on redeploying every timeâfuture-you will hate you.

Whatâs the Move?

Do you want to 
quickly set up an Edge Config or CMS now
, or are you just hoping Future You deals with it? ð

You said:

yes we can set up edge config and can we build a repo based of whats working now?

Smart moveâEdge Config for quick copy changes, plus a repo based on the working V0.dev build so we have a structured foundation.
 Letâs get you 
future-proof
 before Elonâs tweets start rolling in.

Step 1: Extract the Working V0.dev Build

Since the current V0.dev â Vercel deployment 
is working
, we need to 
pull that codebase
 and create a proper GitHub repo. Hereâs how:

Check Vercel Dashboard

Go to 
Vercel > Your Project > Settings > Git

See if the project is already linked to a repo (unlikely, but worth checking).

If not, weâll manually extract it.

Download the Project from Vercel (if possible)

Vercel doesnât have a âdownload projectâ button, but you can:

Clone the deployed code via Vercel CLI (if V0.dev pushed via CLI).

Or manually re-create the repo using the same code from V0.dev.

Create a GitHub Repo & Push the Working Code

Make a 
new GitHub repo
 (
your-project-name
).

Locally, 
git init
 the extracted project and push it to the repo:

bash

Copy

Edit

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git add .
git commit -m 

"Initial commit from V0.dev build"

git push -u origin main

Link this repo to Vercel (
Vercel > New Project > Import GitHub Repo
).

Now 
any future changes go through GitHub, not V0.dev
.

Step 2: Set Up Edge Config for Quick Copy Edits

Now that the repo is stable, letâs make sure 
you can change text without touching code
.

Enable Edge Config in Vercel

Go to 
Vercel Dashboard > Storage > Edge Config

Create a new Edge Config instance (
site-copy
).

Add key-value pairs like:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"heroTitle"

:

"Welcome to the future"

,

"heroSubtitle"

:

"NFTs powered by Symbi & Solana"

,

"ctaButton"

:

"Mint Now"

}

Use Edge Config in Your Code (Next.js Example)

Install the Vercel Edge Config package:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install @vercel/edge-config

Import it into your page/component:

javascript

Copy

Edit

import

 { get } 

from

"@vercel/edge-config"

;

export

async

function

getStaticProps

(

) {

const

 heroTitle = 

await

get

(

"heroTitle"

);

const

 heroSubtitle =
