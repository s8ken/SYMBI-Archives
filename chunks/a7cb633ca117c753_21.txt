the box
 in Next.js (no extra setup needed).

2ï¸â£ Start Your Next.js Project With Turbopack

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev --turbo

or

bash

Copy

Edit

next dev --turbo

You should see:

arduino

Copy

Edit

Turbopack is now running...

ð¥ 
Your dev environment is now super fast!

3ï¸â£ (Optional) Check for Errors

If Turbopack 
fails
 or breaks Tailwind styles, switch back to Webpack temporarily:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Turbopack is still 
experimental
, so if you face any issues, 
you can turn it off
 by removing the 
turbo: true
 config.

ð 
Turbopack is now enabled!

Step 4: Push to GitHub & Deploy to Vercel!

ð Step 3: Choose the Best Options for Your Setup

You're at the 
Next.js setup prompt
âhereâs what to choose:

â Best Options for Your Project

â 
Yes
 â Use ESLint (
Good for catching errors
)

â 
Yes
 â Use TailwindCSS (
We'll style the site with it
)

â 
No
 â Place code in 
src/
 directory (
Keeps project simple
)

â 
Yes
 â Use App Router (**Recommended for Next.js 14+)

â 
Yes
 â Use Turbopack (
Faster local development
)

ð¥ Why These Choices?

Turbopack
 speeds up local development ð

App Router
 is the new standard for Next.js (better for server-side rendering)

TailwindCSS
 is already part of your design

ESLint
 helps catch potential bugs

Once you've selected these options, 
press Enter to continue
.

ð Step 4: Verify Next.js is Running

Great! 
Next.js + Tailwind + Turbopack is installed.
 Now letâs 
test that everything works
 before moving to GitHub and Vercel.

1ï¸â£ Start the Development Server

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Expected output:

arduino

Copy

Edit

Local: http:

//localhost:3000

Turbopack is now running...

If you see that, ð 
Next.js is working!

2ï¸â£ Open Your Browser

Go to:

arduino

Copy

Edit

http:

//localhost:3000

You should see the default 
Next.js homepage
.

â 
If the site loads â Everything is working!

3ï¸â£ Stop the Server (if needed)

Press 
Ctrl + C
 in the terminal to stop it.

ð¥ Next Step: Push to GitHub & Deploy on Vercel

Let me know when your local site is running successfully, and weâll 
get it live on the internet
 ðð

You said:

okay yep so that worked and the next.js homepage loaded

ð Step 5: Push to GitHub & Deploy on Vercel

Now that 
Next.js is running smoothly
, letâs 
push it to GitHub
 and 
deploy it live on Vercel
.

1ï¸â£ Initialize Git & Add Your Repo

Since 
create-next-app
 already initialized Git, we just need to link it to your 
GitHub repo
.

A. Add Your Remote Repository

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git

B. Verify the Remote is Set Correctly

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote -v

Expected output:

perl

Copy

Edit

origin  https:

//gi

thub.com/s8ken/Symbi.git (fetch)
origin  https:

//gi

thub.com/s8ken/Symbi.git (

push

)

2ï¸â£ Commit & Push Your Code

Now, commit everything and push it to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Initial Next.js setup with Tailwind & Turbopack"

git push -u origin main

ð 
Now your project is on GitHub!

3ï¸â£ Deploy on Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard
