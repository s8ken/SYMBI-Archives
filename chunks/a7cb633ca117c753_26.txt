 { 

ThemeProviderProps

 } 

from

"next-themes"

export

function

ThemeProvider

(

{ children, ...props }: ThemeProviderProps

) {

return

<
NextThemesProvider

 {

...props

}>{children}

</
NextThemesProvider

>
}

Then 
wrap your layout inside it
 in 
layout.tsx
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

<

ThemeProvider

  attribute=

"class"

  defaultTheme=

"dark"

  enableSystem={

false

}
  forcedTheme=

"dark"

  disableTransitionOnChange
>
  {children}
</

ThemeProvider

>

ð¥ 
Now, your site will have your original dark theme and styles!

2ï¸â£ Ensure Your Page Layout Matches Your Design

Right now, 
page.tsx
 is just a basic template.

Do you want to:

Rebuild the UI inside Next.js with Tailwind?

Import a pre-built design from Figma/V0.dev?

Use an existing HTML/CSS design and convert it to Next.js?

We can 
fully customize the siteâs UI
âyou just tell me 
how much control you want over the look.

3ï¸â£ Develop Without Breaking Your Design

If youâre worried about 
breaking the design while developing AI features
, we can:

Keep AI separate from the main UI
 (e.g., 
/ai
 route for AI tools).

Only add AI elements in sections where needed
 (e.g., AI chatbot in sidebar).

Use separate pages for different AI tools
 (
/image-gen
, 
/chat
, 
/dashboard
).

â 
This way, your UI stays clean, and AI features donât mess up the main experience.

ð¥ Final Question: How Do You Want to Develop?

1ï¸â£ 
Keep everything inside Next.js + Tailwind (fully customizable, scalable).

2ï¸â£ 
Use a visual tool (V0.dev, Figma-to-code, or an existing UI framework).

3ï¸â£ 
Import an existing HTML/CSS template and integrate it into Next.js.

ð Fully Customizable & Scalable â Without You Writing Every Line

I hear youâ
you donât want to be manually coding every little thing
 while also ensuring the site is scalable and fits your vision. 
We need a balance
:

1ï¸â£ 
You control the vision & functionality
 (without doing deep coding)

2ï¸â£ 
The site remains scalable & customizable
 (not locked into a rigid template)

3ï¸â£ 
Development is fast & efficient
 (without getting stuck debugging CSS for hours)

ð¥ The Best Approach: Mix AI-Assisted Development with Manual Customization

Instead of you manually typing out every file, 
we use AI-powered tools that generate clean Next.js code
âbut in a way thatâs still 
editable and scalable
.

Here's how we do it:

1ï¸â£ Use V0.dev to Generate the Layout & Components

Since 
V0.dev already gave you a working layout
, let's 
pull its design into your Next.js project
 and refine it.

â 
Go to

V0.dev

â 
Enter your design requirements
 (Example: "A futuristic dark-themed landing page for Symbi AI")

â 
Export the code into Next.js format

ð¡ 
Then, we integrate this into your Next.js project, so you donât need to build the layout from scratch.

2ï¸â£ Keep AI Separate â Custom Pages for AI Features

Instead of forcing 
Replicate AI
 or 
Symbi automation
 into the main page immediately, we 
isolate those features
 into their own sections:

/image-gen
 â 
AI Image Generator (Replicate)

/chat
 â 
AI Chatbot (Symbi Integration)

/dashboard
 â 
Admin Control Panel

/
 â 
Main landing page (fully custom design)

ð¡ 
This keeps your front-end design clean and fully customizable while allowing AI features to be modular.

3ï¸â£ Ensure the UI is Editable Without Code

You want the ability to update content 
without touching code every time.

We integrate 
one of these:

Option 1: Vercel Edge Config (Super Simple)

Edit site content 
instantly
 from Vercelâs dashboard.

No need to redeploy for small changes (like text updates).

Keeps everything serverless and fast.

Option 2: Headless CMS (Sanity or Notion-Based)

If you want 
blog posts, dynamic text, or marketing pages
, we
