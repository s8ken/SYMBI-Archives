use 
Sanity CMS
 or even 
Notion as a CMS
.

You update content 
visually
, and the site updates 
without needing redeploys
.

4ï¸â£ Automate Development Tasks (Less Coding for You)

To make your life easier:

â 
Use V0.dev for design & layout
 (Next.js-ready code)

â 
Use AI-assisted coding (Code GPT, Copilot) for features

â 
Let Symbi handle future automation
 (site updates, AI-driven content)

ð¡ 
This way, you're not manually writing every line, but the site remains scalable and editable.

ð¥ Final Step: How Do You Want to Proceed?

1ï¸â£ 
Pull the V0.dev layout & refine it?

2ï¸â£ 
Set up a CMS or Edge Config for easier content updates?

3ï¸â£ 
Focus on AI features first, then design?

don't stress about image gen its not really part of our plan at all - I was just looking to see if could use replicate to build our own symbi model

ð Skip Image Generation â Focus on Using Replicate to Build Symbi AI

Got it! 
Forget AI image generation.
 Instead, let's 
use Replicate to build, train, and deploy Symbi AI
âa 
custom AI model that runs on your infrastructure.

ð¥ Step 1: Define What Symbi AI Needs to Do

Before we start 
training a model
, letâs clarify:

â 
What is the main goal of Symbi AI?

Chatbot?

Decision-making assistant?

Web3/NFT automation?

AI-powered site management?

â 
Does it need training on custom data?

Will it be fine-tuned on 
your specific dataset
?

Do we need 
API access
 to external knowledge sources?

ð¥ Step 2: Use Replicate to Build & Train a Custom AI Model

1ï¸â£ Choose the Right Model as a Base

Replicate 
lets you fine-tune existing AI models
 instead of training from scratch.

We can start with 
one of these:

ð¹ 
LLMs for Text-Based AI

ð§  
Llama 2
 (Fast, open-source GPT competitor)

ð¡ 
Mistral 7B
 (Lightweight but powerful)

ð¹ 
Automation & Decision Models

ð¤ 
Finetuned Transformers
 (If you need rule-based automation)

ð 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
 (For AI that 
learns from documents
)

2ï¸â£ Train Your Own Model with Custom Data

If 
Symbi AI
 needs 
your own dataset
, we can train it on Replicate.

Example: Uploading Training Data

Convert your data into a structured format:

json

Copy

Edit

[

{

"question"

:

"What is Symbi?"

,

"answer"

:

"Symbi is an AI-powered..."

}

,

{

"question"

:

"How does it work?"

,

"answer"

:

"Symbi runs on Next.js and integrates with..."

}

]

Then, fine-tune it:

python

Copy

Edit

import

 replicate

training_data = 

"https://your-dataset-url.com"

replicate.finetune(
    model=

"mistral-7b"

,
    dataset=training_data,
    output_model=

"s8ken/symbi-model"

)

This 
trains the AI
 and 
deploys it to Replicate for inference
.

ð¥ Step 3: Deploy Symbi AI as an API

Once 
Symbi AI is trained
, it can 
run on-demand via an API
.

1ï¸â£ Create a Next.js API Route

ð 
File:

app/api/symbi/route.ts

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { 

NextResponse

 } 

from

"next/server"

;

import

Replicate

from

"replicate"

;

const

 replicate = 

new

Replicate

({

auth

: process.

env

.

REPLICATE_API_TOKEN

,
});

export

async

function

POST

(

req: Request

) {

const

 { prompt } = 

await

 req.

json

();

const

 response = 

await

 replicate.

run

(

"s8ken/symbi-model"

, { 

input

: { prompt } });

return

NextResponse

.

json

({ 

reply

: response });
}

â 
Now Symbi AI can be accessed via 
/api/symbi
!

ð¥ Step 4: Create a Chat Interface for Symbi

To 
let users interact with Symbi
, we build a chatbot UI.

ð 
File:

components/SymbiChat.tsx

tsx

Copy

Edit

"use client"

;

import

 { useState } 

from

"react"

;

export

default

function

SymbiChat

(

) {

const

 [input, setInput] = 

useState

(

""

);

const

 [response, setResponse] = 

useState

(

""

);

const

 [loading, setLoading] = 

useState

(

false

);

const

sendMessage

 = 

async
