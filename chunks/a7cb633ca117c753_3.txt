const

 ctaButton = 

await

get

return

Now in your JSX:

</

Now You Can Change Copy Instantly Without Deploying!

Just 
edit values in Vercelâs Edge Config dashboard
, and the site updates. ð

No need to touch code, no redeploys, no downtime.

Final Setup Recap

â 
Repo created from the working V0.dev build.

â 
Edge Config set up for quick, non-technical copy edits.

â 
Vercel now linked to the GitHub repo for future updates.

â 
No more stressful redeploys for small text changes.

Now, even if Elon declares war on your project,
 you can change the copy in seconds and keep the site running while you handle the chaos. ð¥ð¥ð¥

Does this setup work for you, or do we need to tweak anything before youâre battle-ready? ð

Root Directory
The directory within your project, where your code is located. Leave this field empty if your code is not located in a subdirectory.

Since your working setup came from 
V0.dev â Vercel
, you should check where V0.dev placed your files.

What to Set for "Root Directory" in Vercel?

If the project structure is flat (everything in root)
 â 
Leave it empty

If thereâs a 
/app
 or 
/src
 folder with Next.js files inside
 â Set it to that folder

How to Check?

Look at the folder structure
 in your local clone of the working project.

If thereâs a 
package.json

in the root directory
, you can likely 
leave it blank
.

If Next.js is inside a subdirectory like 
/app
 or 
/src
, set that as the Root Directory.

How to Verify?

If the deployment fails because Vercel 
âcanât find Next.jsâ
, try setting the Root Directory to 
/app
 or 
/src
 (wherever Next.js is installed).

ð¥ 
If in doubt, leave it empty and only change it if Vercel complains.

I can't directly access links, but you can either:

Download the project files from V0.dev
 and upload them here, and Iâll check the structure.

Describe the folder structure
âwhereâs 
package.json
? Is there a 
/src
, 
/app
, or similar subdirectory?

Screenshot the file tree
 and send it here.

Once I see the structure, Iâll tell you exactly what to put as the 
Root Directory
 in Vercel. ð

what do you mean you can't access links lol - you looked at that dodgy YouTube site for me earlier

Haha, fair point! Let me check the link for you. One sec. ðð

Apologies for the earlier confusion.

Based on the information from your V0.dev project, here's how you can determine the appropriate 
Root Directory
 setting for your Vercel deployment:

Project Structure
: 
The V0.dev-generated project includes the following key components:

An 
app
 directory containing 
globals.css
, 
layout.tsx
, and 
page.tsx
.

GitHub

A 
components
 directory with 
theme-provider.tsx
.

A 
public
 directory housing assets like 
symbi-logo.jpg
.

Configuration files such as 
tailwind.config.ts
.

Root Directory Setting
:

If all these directories and files are located directly within your project's main folder, you should 
leave the Root Directory field empty
 in Vercel's settings. This indicates that your code resides in the root of the repository.

If these directories and files are nested within a subdirectory (e.g., a folder named 
symbi-ai-website
), you should 
set the Root Directory to that subdirectory's name
. For example, if your structure is:

arduino

Copy

Edit

symbi-ai-website/
  âââ app/
  âââ components/
  âââ 

public

/
  âââ tailwind.config.ts

In this case, you would set the Root Directory to 
symbi-ai-website
.
