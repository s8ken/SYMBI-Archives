â The archive is unzipped.

Inside, weâve got a folder called 

sanity .rtfd

 (yep, with that space in the nameâmacOS vibes) and the usual 
__MACOSX
 ghost files.

Let me take a peek inside that 
sanity .rtfd
 folder and see what youâre working with... ðµï¸ââï¸ð

Result

['TXT.rtf', 'Attachment.png']

Inside the 

sanity .rtfd

 folder, weâve got:

ð 

TXT.rtf

 â likely the main instructions or notes

ð¼ï¸ 

Attachment.png

 â maybe a visual diagram or screenshot

Let me read the 
.rtf
 and see what secrets are tucked inside ð¯ï¸ð

Ah, the ancient 
.rtf
 format strikes againâ
and Iâm missing the tools to decode its cryptic magic right now.
 ð¤

No worries, though. Iâll use a different method to extract and read the raw contents of 
TXT.rtf
 without needing the special decoder. Hang tight... ðð

ð§¨ Oof. That 
.rtf
 file is laced with some heavy macOS formattingâitâs not just text, itâs likely embedded fonts, styles, or even binary blobs.

Let me try one more trick and decode it as 
latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)
âit's often a safe fallback for quirky RTFs. Stand by... ð§ªð
