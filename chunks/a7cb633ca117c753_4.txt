, 
components
, etc.) are located.

Configure Vercel
: 
In your Vercel project settings, set the Root Directory accordingly based on your project's structure.

By ensuring the Root Directory is set correctly, Vercel will be able to locate and deploy your Next.js application without issues.

Looking at your **Verc

Alright, looking at your 
project structure
, your 
Root Directory
 setting in Vercel should be 
left empty (
./
)
, which youâve already set correctly. â

Why?

Your 
package.json
 (which contains dependencies and build scripts) is in the 
root
.

Your 
next.config.mjs
 is also in the 
root
, which is where Vercel expects it.

Your 
app/
 directory is the standard Next.js 
App Router
 structure.

The 
public/
 folder is correctly placed for serving static assets.

Next Steps:

Push this folder to GitHub
 (if not already).

bash

Copy

Edit

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git add .
git commit -m 

"Initial commit from V0.dev build"

git push -u origin main

Ensure your 
.gitignore
 is set up

Make sure you're not pushing unnecessary files (like 
node_modules
). If missing, create a 
.gitignore
 file and add:

bash

Copy

Edit

node_modules/
.next/
.

env

Deploy via Vercel

In 
Vercel
, select 
"Import GitHub Repo"
, link it, and deploy.

Test Your Deployment

Once live, verify that everything looks and works the same as the V0.dev version.

Now Youâre Set!

â 
GitHub is in sync with the working build

â 
Vercel pulls from GitHub for future updates

â 
Root Directory is correct, so no weird build issues

This is 
the cleanest setup
 for now. Later, when you need to 
update copy dynamically
, we can fully set up 
Vercel Edge Config or a CMS
.

ð¥ 
Now youâre battle-ready for launch.
 ð Let me know if you hit any snags!

so I haven't created the repo yet so I'll do that via the GitHub website

Perfect! Hereâs the 
step-by-step
 to set up the repo on GitHub and push your existing project. ð

1ï¸â£ Create a New Repository on GitHub

Go to

GitHub
 and log in.

Click the 
â (plus) icon
 in the top right and select 
New repository
.

Repository Name
 â Name it something like 
symbi-ai-website
.

Visibility
 â Choose 
Public
 (or Private if you prefer).

DON'T
 check âInitialize this repository with a READMEâ (weâll handle that manually).

Click 
Create Repository
.

2ï¸â£ Push Your Local Project to GitHub

Now, open 
Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
 and run the following:

bash

Copy

Edit

# Navigate to your project folder

cd

 path/to/your/project

# Initialize Git (if not already done)

git init

# Add the GitHub repo as a remote

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/symbi-ai-website.git

# Add all files to Git tracking

git add .

# Commit the changes

git commit -m 

"Initial commit from V0.dev build"

# Push to GitHub (force set main branch)

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

3ï¸â£ Link the Repo to Vercel

Go to Vercel Dashboard
 â 
https://vercel.com/dashboard
.

Click 
âNew Projectâ
 â Select 
Import GitHub Repository
.

Find your 

symbi-ai-website

 repo and click 
Import
.

Keep all settings as default
 (Root Directory should remain 
./
).

Click 
Deploy
 and wait for it to go live! ð

4ï¸â£ Final Checks

â 
Visit your live site
 (Vercel will give you a URL like 
symbi-ai.vercel.app
).

â 
Check logs in Vercel
 to confirm there are no errors.

â 
If anything breaks
, Vercel logs will tell you what went wrong.

ð¥ 
Now you have a full GitHub + Vercel deployment pipeline!
 ð¥

Any future changes
 â Just 
git push
 to GitHub, and Vercel will auto-deploy. ð

If you need copy updates
 â Weâll set up 
Edge Config
 or a simple CMS next.

Let me know if anything breaks
âIâll help you debug! ð
