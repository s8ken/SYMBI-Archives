Alright, we're 
very close
, but your issue is 
either the repo doesnât exist on GitHub OR the URL is slightly wrong.
 Letâs fix it step by step. ð

1ï¸â£ Confirm the Repo Exists on GitHub

Go to 
GitHub
 in your browser and check if 
symbi-ai-website
 exists:

If 
it doesnât exist
, manually create a 
new repo
 with that exact name.

If 
it does exist
, the issue is likely 
authentication or a typo in the URL
.

2ï¸â£ Check for Typos in Your Remote URL

Sometimes Git adds an extra 
/
 at the end, which breaks things.

Run this command to 
remove the existing remote
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote remove origin

Now, 
add it again with the correct URL
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote add origin https://github.com/S8ken/symbi-ai-website.git

3ï¸â£ Try Pushing Again

Now, push your code:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main

ð¥ If 
that still fails
, then itâs an 
authentication issue.
 ð¥

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

4ï¸â£ If You Get an Authentication Error

If Git asks for a password, 
GitHub no longer supports password authentication
.

Instead, you need to 
use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

How to Use a GitHub Token Instead of Password

Go to 
GitHub â Settings â Developer Settings â Personal Access Tokens

ð GitHub Tokens

Click 
"Generate new token"
, select:

repo
 (for full repo access)

write:packages

`delete

Got it! Your repo is named 
"Symbi"
 and not 
"symbi-ai-website"
âthatâs why Git is throwing the 
"Repository not found"
 error.

1ï¸â£ Update Your Remote to the Correct Repo

Since your Git remote is pointing to a non-existent repo, we need to 
fix it
.

Run this command to update your Git remote to the correct GitHub repo:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/S8ken/Symbi.git

2ï¸â£ Verify the Change

Now check that Git is correctly pointing to your real repo:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote -v

It should now show:

perl

Copy

Edit

origin  https:

//gi

thub.com/S8ken/Symbi.git (fetch)
origin  https:

//gi

thub.com/S8ken/Symbi.git (

push

)

3ï¸â£ Push Your Code to GitHub

Now that your remote is fixed, push your code:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main

ð¥ This should 
finally
 push your project to the correct 
Symbi
 repo on GitHub. After that, you can head to 
Vercel
, import the repo, and deploy! ð

Let me know if you hit any issues. ð

Alright! Your 
remote URL is now correct
, but you accidentally ran part of the output (
origin ... fetch
) as a command. No worriesâletâs 
get back on track and push your code
.

1ï¸â£ Push Your Code to GitHub

Now that your 
Git remote is correctly set to

https://github.com/S8ken/Symbi.git
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main

If it still fails with authentication issues
, try:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

2ï¸â£ If You Get an Authentication Error (GitHub Password Issue)

ð´ 
GitHub no longer allows password authentication via Git
. If prompted for a password, you need to use a 
GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
.

Generate a GitHub Token

Go to GitHub â Settings â Developer Settings â Personal Access Tokens

ð 
Click here to generate a token

Click 
"Generate new token"
, select:

repo
 (full repo access)

read:packages

Copy the token 
(you wonât see it again after leaving the page).

Use the Token Instead of a Password
