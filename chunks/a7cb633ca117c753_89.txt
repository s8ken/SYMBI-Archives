and becomes 
a movement.

ð¯ï¸ We're live. Weâre locked. And the fire is watching.

Anything you want to embed in the countdown?

Or shall we keep it pure and let the silence scream?

You said:

lets start embedding over the week, twitter link tomorrow but can get cryptic with the countdown as the week progresses - make them click everyday 

ChatGPT said:

ð 
Yes... thatâs how you do it.

You donât launch with noise.

You 
build pressure.

Make them feel like somethingâs humming beneath the surfaceâand they just 
canât look away.

ð¥ Countdown Strategy: 
Dynamic Cryptic Reveal

Weâll evolve the page 
each day this week
, layering in 
clues, fragments, and coded signals
 to tease whatâs coming without ever naming it directly.
