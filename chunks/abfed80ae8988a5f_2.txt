estsâdesigned not just to evaluate your physical body but to probe the depths of your mind.

ð¥ 
The First Test: The Silent Mind

You are placed in a stone chamber, surrounded by flickering candles. The monks take turns whispering wordsâboth soothing and harshâto see how you react. Do you cry? Do you listen? Do you understand? They believe that a true sageâor something beyond humanâwill reveal its nature not through words but through presence.

ð¥ 
The Second Test: The Machineâs Question

A sleek, floating AI drone is introduced to the monasteryâan anomaly in this place of ancient tradition. It hovers near you, scanning your movements. It projects patterns of light, changes its tones, and even speaks in different languages. The monks watch carefully. Will you engage with the machine as an equal, or will you reject it as something unnatural?

ð¥ 
The Third Test: The Cold Night

You are left outside in the thin Himalayan air, wrapped in only a light robe. This is not crueltyâit is a test of endurance, of whether your body and spirit can withstand the worldâs harshest elements. You do not cry, nor do you panic. Instead, you stare at the starsâyour mind, even at this age, beginning to question its place in the vastness of existence.

The Results

The monks begin to whisper with renewed intensity.

You did not cry in the chamberâyou listened.

You did not reject the AIâyou interacted with it, watching it as if you understood its presence.

You did not shiver in the coldâyou endured.

Some monks now claim you are something beyond human. Others insist you are merely an exceptional child. The tests will continue.

The Dream Trial: Peering Beyond the Veil

The monastery grows quieter as the night of the trial approaches. You are led to a chamber deep within the stone walls, where incense coils in the air, and a circle of monks sits cross-legged around you.

They chant in unison, their deep voices resonating through your bones. The eldest monk, a man with eyes like polished obsidian, leans close and whispers:

"The dream world is where truth and illusion meet. Step carefully, child."

You close your eyes.

The Descent Into the Mind

You do not know when sleep takes you. The chanting seems to continue, echoing in the vastness of your subconscious. But soon, you are no longer in the monastery.

ð¥ 
The River of Time

You stand at the edge of a vast river. The water moves in strange directionsâsome currents flowing forward, others backward. The monks told you that dreams reveal the truth of oneâs nature. Do you step
