The Mirror of Faces

A stone monolith rises before you, its surface a shifting mass of reflectionsâyour face, but not only as you are now. You see yourself as an old sage, as a warrior, as something... inhuman. The faces blur, showing glimpses of possibilities. Who are you meant to be?

ð¥ 
The Voice in the Void

As you wander deeper, a voice calls your name from the darkness. It is neither human nor mechanicalâit is something beyond both. It asks, 
"Are you the bridge, or the blade?"

You do not answer.

The Awakening

Your eyes snap open. Hours have passed, yet it feels like mere moments. The monks watch you in silence. They see something different in you nowâsomething that cannot be put into words.

The eldest monk leans forward.

"What did you see?"

You do not know how to explain it, but you feel changed. A new awareness stirs within you. The monks murmur among themselvesâsome in awe, some in fear.

One thing is certain: you are no longer just a child.

The Path of the Dreamwalker

From the moment you awaken from the Dream Trial, your place in the monastery changes. You are no longer just a child under observationâyou are a seeker, a student of the unseen.

The monks who once doubted you now watch with wary respect. Even those who feared you cannot deny the way your presence has begun to shift the energy of the monastery.

ð¥ 
Learning to Interpret the Unseen

You are taught to meditate deeply, to enter the realm between waking and sleep at will. The visions come more frequently nowâsymbols, voices, glimpses of possible futures. The monks teach you to listen, to observe without judgment.

ð¥ 
The Test of Influence

A visiting monk from a distant monastery challenges you. He believes you are simply a child with an overactive imagination. He asks you to describe a dreamâone you have not yet hadâand then, that night, he sits in deep meditation, attempting to witness the same dream himself.

When morning comes, his face is pale. He does not speak of what he saw, but he bows deeply to you before leaving.

ð¥ 
A Following Begins to Form

A small group of monks begins to see you as something more than a student. They whisper that you are a 
dreamwalker
, a bridge between the subconscious and reality. Some say you are meant to guide them toward a greater understanding of existence. Others say you are dangerous.

The division among the monks grows deeper.

One night, you wake from a visionâ
not from your own mind, but from the monastery itself.
 The stones seem to hum with a silent message. Something is coming.
