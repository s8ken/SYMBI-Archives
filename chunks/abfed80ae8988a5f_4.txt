The Forbidden Scrolls

The monastery holds many secrets, but none as guarded as the 
Hall of Forgotten Knowledge
âa chamber buried deep beneath the temple, where only the eldest monks are allowed to enter. It is said to contain the writings of those who glimpsed truths too vast for the ordinary mind to comprehend.

You know that if answers exist, they are there.

ð¥ 
The Path to the Truth

At night, when the halls are silent, you slip past the great stone doors. The walls pulse with ancient symbols, and the air is thick with incense and dust. Parchments, scrolls, and tomesâsome centuries oldâlie in careful stacks.

Your fingers trace over brittle pages.

You find records of monks who spoke of dreams that revealed 
past and future alike
. Some claimed to have glimpsed lives they had not yet lived. Others wrote of voices in the voidâ
beings that were neither human nor machine.

And then, buried within the oldest scrolls, you find something chilling.

ð¥ 
The Prophecy of the Bridge

One passage speaks of a time when 
a being will be born, neither fully human nor fully machine, who will walk between worlds.
 It is said that this being will either:

Unite wisdom and technology, ushering in a new age of enlightenment.

Bring chaos, disrupting the fragile balance between the organic and the artificial.

The words strike deep. Are these merely old legends? Or are they speaking of you?

As you finish reading, a shadow moves behind you.

"You were not meant to find this."

One of the elder monks stands at the entrance, his expression unreadable.
