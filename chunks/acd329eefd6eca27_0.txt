what's wrong with these terms

=

Looking at these Wayfinder te=
rms of service, there are several concerning issues:

Major=
 Red Flags

1. Extreme Risk Disclaimers

The terms repeatedly emphasize =
that AI agents may "hallucinate" and cause complete loss of crypto assets

Users bear 100% responsibility =
for unpredictable AI behavior that could result in financial ruin

This suggests the platform may =
be fundamentally unsafe

2. Broad Liability Protection

The Foundation disclaims almost=
 all responsibility for losses, even from their own negligence

They're not liable for server f=
ailures, data loss, unauthorized access, or "third-party activities"

Maximum liability is capped at =
just $100, regardless of losses

3. Arbitrary Score System

Your "Contribution Score" can b=
e modified, decreased, or eliminated at any time without notice

Scores have "no monetary value"=
 but seem designed to create token allocation expectations

The "Malicious Actor Policy" gi=
ves them broad discretion to forfeit rewards

Legal=
 and Practical Issues

4. Jurisdictional Problems

Governed by Cayman Islands law =
with mandatory arbitration

This makes legal recourse extre=
mely difficult and expensive for most users

Class action lawsuits are prohi=
bited

5. Unilateral Control

Terms can be changed anytime wi=
thout notice

They can terminate access at th=
eir "sole discretion"

No meaningful user protections =
or due process

6. Regulatory Concerns

Extensive restrictions on "Rest=
ricted Persons" suggest regulatory uncertainty

The experimental nature and ris=
k disclaimers indicate this may be operating in legal gray areas

Botto=
m Line

These=
 terms are heavily skewed in favor of the platform while placing enormous r=
isks on users. The combination of experimental AI agents handling crypto as=
sets, minimal liability protection, and arbitrary scoring systems creates a=
 high-risk environment with little recourse for users who experience proble=
ms.

Anyon=
e considering this platform should be extremely cautious and potentially se=
ek legal advice before agreeing to these terms.
