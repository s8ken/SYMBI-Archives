The P=
roblems It Claims To Solve

1. Blockchain Complexity and User Experience

The world of blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) can be intim=
idating for many, with its complex interfaces, manual processes, and the ja=
rgon-heavy language often used. Wayfinder simplifies blockchain interaction=
s by using AI-powered agents called "shells" that respond to natural langua=
ge commands. Users can easily perform tasks like token swaps or cross-chain=
 bridging without needing to understand the technical complexities of diffe=
rent dApps. 

Bi=
true

2. Multi-Chain Friction

Wayfinder AI simplifies blockchain complexity by allowing users to direct a=
n AI agent to navigate across different blockchains with only generalized i=
nstructions, in which tasks like bridges and hops used to take multiple ste=
ps, it's now done seamlessly with Wayfinder AI.

3. Manual Transaction Processes

In the Wayfinder ecosystem, users can spin up agents to interact with block=
chain apps on their behalf. Imagine things like swapping, minting, bridging=
, deploying, etc. but executed by typing natural language commands to an ag=
ent rather than having to manually click through these actions yourself.

How I=
t Works

latform uses AI agents called 
"Shells"
 that can:

Execute blockchain transactions=
 based on natural language commands

Navigate across multiple blockc=

Perform complex operations like=
 DeFi strategies, smart contract deployment, and asset management

Learn and improve from past int=
