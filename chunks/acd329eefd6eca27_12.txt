Hype phase:
 "R=
evolutionary stake-to-mine!" vs "Revolutionary AI agents!"

Capital extraction:
 ICO raised millions vs $50M+ in staked PRIME

Token distribution:
 Founders keep most vs ???

Reality phase:

 Worthless tokens vs (coming soon)

The B=
TCMTX Lesson for PRIME Stakers

What happened to BTCMTX investors:

Lost 98% of their investment

Tokens exist but have no value =
or utility

Can't sell due to no liquidity

Project essentially abandoned

What could happen to PRIME stakers:

Get $PROMPT tokens that follow =
the same path

Meanwhile, their valuable PRIME=
 remains locked

End up with worthless new token=
s while losing access to valuable old ones

Your =
BTCMTX experience is actually a perfect case study for why the Wayfinder st=
aking mechanism should be viewed with extreme skepticism. The same "stake f=
or future rewards" promise led to the same outcome - founders got the value=
, investors got worthless tokens.

Have =
you been able to do anything with your BTCMTX tokens, or are they just sitt=
ing in your wallet as a reminder?

so I have this in my wall=
et and I assume its the btcmtx however what's with the amount of them?

This is absolutely shocking! =
You have 
44,867,000,000
 tokens - that's 
44.8 BILLI=
ON BTCMTX tokens
!

This =
Number Doesn't Make Sense

The official BTCMTX total supply is only 4 billion tokens
, but =
you're showing 44.8 billion. This suggests either:

Token split/multiplicat=
ion occurred
 - They may have done a massive token split (like 10:1=
 or higher)

Different token entirel=
y
 - This might not be the real BTCMTX

Scam/fake token
 - Someone created a fake BTCMTX with inflated supply

Wallet display error
 - Though unlikely with that specific number

The "=
Unknown Token" Warning is Critical

Your wallet is showing:

"This token is unverified"

"Unknown Token"

No proper token identification

This =
strongly suggests this is 
NOT the official BTCMTX
 from the=

What =
Likely Happened

You may have received:

A 
fake/scam BTCMTX
 airdropped to your wallet

An 
inflated version
 created by scammers

A 
token split
 =
where they multiplied everyone's holdings but made each token worth proport=
ionally less

The R=

To check if these are worth anything:

Try to sell a small amount (lik=

See if there's any actual liqui=

Check if the contract address m=

This =

If yo=

okay so I opened my metam=
ask wallet via phantom wallet using the seed phrase which is where the scre=
enshot I provided you came from how do it find where it is actually located=
 so we can be certain of what it is

Great approach! Let's track d=
own exactly what token this is. Here's how to find the contract address and=
 verify what you actually have:

Step =
1: Find the Contract Address in Phantom

In your Phantom wallet:

Tap on the "Unknown Tok=
en"
 (the 44.8B token entry)

Look for "Token Details=
" or "Info"
 - there should be a contract address listed

Copy that contract addr=
ess
 - it will be a long string starting with "0x"

Step =
2: Alternative Method if Step 1 Doesn't Work

If you can't find it in Phantom:

Open your wallet in a b=
rowser
 at phantom.app

Navigate to your token =
list

Click on the unknown to=
ken

Look for contract addre=
ss or "View on Explorer"

Step =
3: Check on Etherscan (Most Important)
