If it's a fake/scam token (wron=

The K=
ey Evidence

The token name and symbol on Etherscan will definitively tell us
 what you actually have - no guessing needed.

Can y=
ou go to etherscan.io, search for 
0x2e45d47b2f0d0a23500e91488582b136914ccf65
, and tell me what 
Token Name
 and 
Token Symbol
 it shows? That's all we need to solve this mystery.

=

SA

so what does it say can y=
ou check?

I can't directly access Ether=
scan to check your contract address because of the tool restrictions I have=
. The web fetch tool won't let me access URLs that weren't provided by you =
or found in search results.

You need to check it yourself by:

Opening etherscan.io in=
 your browser

Pasting this address in=
 the search:

0x2e45d47b2f0d0a23500e91488582b136914ccf65

Looking at the token de=
tails page

What to look for and report back:

Token Name:
 (t=
he full name at the top)

Symbol:
 (the a=
bbreviation like BTCMTX, PROMPT, etc.)

Total Supply:
 =
(how many tokens exist)

Decimals:
 (usu=
ally 18)

This will take you about 30 seconds
 and will definitively tell =
us what those 44.8 billion tokens actually are.

Once =
you have those details, I can help you understand exactly what you're holdi=
ng and whether they have any value or connection to the Wayfinder ecosystem=
.

Can y=
ou quickly check etherscan.io with that contract address and tell me what n=
ame and symbol it shows?

=

SA

Perfect! This is very reveali=
ng. I can see from your Etherscan screenshot that this is 
a wallet =
address, not a token contract address
.

What =
This Shows

You're looking at:

0x2E45d47B2F0d0a23500e91488582B136914ccF65

This is:
 A wallet address (shows "Address" at the top, not=
 "Token")

The wallet contains:
 Multiple tokens across different bloc=
kchains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, etc.)

What =
We Need to Do

To find your actual token details, we need to:

Click on the "Tokens" t=
ab
 (I can see it in your screenshot)

Look for your 44.8 bill=
ion token
 in that list

Click on that specific =
token
 to see its contract details

Or alternatively:

Go back to your Phantom wallet

When you click on the "Unknown =
Token" with 44.8B balance

Look for "View on Explorer" or =
"Contract Address"

That will take you to the actua=
l 
token contract page
, not the wallet page

The K=
ey Difference

Wallet address
 =3D Where your tokens are stored (what you just =
showed me)

Token contract address
 =3D The actual token's smart contra=
ct (what we need to see)

Can y=
ou either:

Click the "Tokens" tab
 in your current Etherscan page, or

Go back to Phantom and =
find the direct link to the token contract
 (not your wallet)?

We're=
 close! We just need to see the actual token details, not your wallet detai=
ls.

=

SA

This is very telling! The Eth=
erscan tokens page shows 
"0 tokens"
 and 
"There are=
 no matching entries"
 for your wallet address.

What =
This Means

Your 44.8 billion tokens don't exist on Ethereum mainnet!
 Here'=
s what's happening:

Phantom wallet is showi=
ng tokens
 that aren't actually on Ethereum

Etherscan can't find an=
y tokens
 in your wallet

This suggests the token=
s are either:

On a different blockchain (Sola=
na, BSC, Polygon, etc.)

Fake tokens that only exist in =
your wallet display

Test tokens or airdrops that ha=
ve no real value

Next =
Steps to Solve This

Since the tokens aren't on Ethereum, we need to check:

Which blockchain are th=
ey actually on?

In Phantom, look at the network=
 selector (top of the app)

Are you viewing Ethereum, Solan=
a, or another chain?

Check the token details=
 in Phantom:

Tap on the 44.8B token again

Look for "Network" or blockchai=
n information

See if there's a different expl=
orer link (not Etherscan)

The P=
lot Thickens

This discovery is actually more suspicious
 because:

Phantom shows you have tokens

But Ethereum blockchain shows y=
ou have none

This suggests either pha
