latform revolves around two tokens:

$PROMPT

$PRIME

el's existing token that can be staked to earn $PROMPT

The R=

While=
 Wayfinder positions itself as solving legitimate blockchain UX problems, t=
he current focus seems heavily centered on:

Token speculation
 - Most coverage focuses on the upcoming $PROMPT airdrop

Staking rewards
 - 45% of tokens allocated to $PRIME stakers

Gaming speculation
 - Betting on the future success of AI gaming

The p=
latform is still in closed alpha, meaning the actual problem-solving capabi=
lities haven't been proven at scale yet. The extreme risk disclaimers in th=
