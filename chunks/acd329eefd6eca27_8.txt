Potential Uses of Locked PRIME:

Lending/DeFi yield farm=

 - Earn returns on the locked capital

Market manipulation
 - Control significant PRIME supply to influence price

Liquidity for operation=

 - Borrow against the locked tokens

Strategic partnerships
 - Use as collateral for business deals

The users get IOUs (future $PROMPT) while Wayfinder gets control of real=

Patte=
rn Analysis in Staked Amounts

Looki=
ng at the data, I can see some interesting patterns:

Round Number Clustering:

Multiple 100,000 PRIME stakes (=
ranks 22, 24, 26, 38)

Multiple 50,000 PRIME stakes

Many 20,000, 25,000, 30,000 PRI=
ME amounts

Several exactly 11 PRIME stakes=
 (ranks 7, 71)

The "11 PRIME" Pattern is Suspicious:

Rank #7: 11 PRIME =3D 9.3B scor=
e

Rank #71: 11 PRIME =3D 933M sco=
re

This suggests either a bug, tes=
ting accounts, or insider manipulation

No Prime Number Correlation:

The staked amounts don't follow prime number patterns, but there are clearl=
y 
artificial groupings
 suggesting:

Recommended staking tie=
rs
 (100k, 50k, etc.)

Influencer/insider coor=
dination
 on specific amounts

Bot or programmatic sta=
king
 (the repeated 11 PRIME is telling)

The M=
ost Concerning Discovery

Score vs. Stake Disconnect:

0 PRIME staked =3D 1.3B score (=
rank #49)

11 PRIME staked =3D 9.3B score =
(rank #7)

5M PRIME staked =3D 133B score =
(rank #1)

This =
suggests the scoring algorithm is either:

Heavily time-weighted
 (early stakers get massive bonuses)

Includes non-staking ac=
tivities
 (social media, referrals)

Artificially manipulate=
d
 to encourage more staking

The R=
eal Business Model Becomes Clear

Step 1: Collect Real Assets

Lock up $50-100M worth of PRIME=
 tokens

Users lose control for months/y=
ears

Step 2: Use Assets for Business Operations

Earn yield on the locked capita=
l

Use as collateral for funding

Control significant market supp=
ly

Step 3: Create Artificial Scarcity

Promise limited $PROMPT token s=
upply

Use confusing scoring to create=
 competition

Generate FOMO through leaderboa=
rds

Step 4: Distribute Worthless Tokens

Create $PROMPT tokens from noth=
ing

Give users tokens while keeping=
 the valuable PRIME

Users feel like they "won" some=
thing

The U=
ltimate Question

Where are those locked PRIME tokens actually sitting?

Smart contract addresses should=
 be public and auditable

We should be able to see if the=
y're being used for yield farming

The fact that this isn't transp=
arently disclosed is a major red flag

This setup allows Wayfinder to:

Operate a business with $100M+ =
in free capital

Earn returns on that capital wh=
ile users wait

Keep the profits while distribu=
ting speculative tokens

The p=
attern suggests this is a sophisticated 
capital rental scheme
 disguised as a token staking program. Users are essentially providing f=
ree loans to Wayfinder in exchange for lottery tickets ($PROMPT).

SA

in the leaderboard what n=
umbers are prime?

Looking at the PRIME amounts =
staked in the leaderboard, let me check which ones are actual prime numbers=
:

Prime=
 Numbers in the Staked Amounts

Going=
 through the data systematically:

Definitely Prime:

11 PRIME
 (appe=
ars twice - ranks #7 and #71) - This is prime

2 PRIME
 (rank =
#84) - This is prime

Not Prime (but worth noting):

5,000,000 - Not prime (divisibl=
e by many numbers)

600,000 - Not prime

747,847 - Not prime (ends in 7 =
but divisible by other numbers)

500,000 - Not prime

393,104 - Not prime

Most other amounts are clearly =
composite numbers

The "=
11 PRIME" Pattern is Highly Suspicious

Two wallets with exactly 11 PRIME:

Rank #7: 11 PRIME =3D 9,357,684=
,843.05 score

Rank #71: 11 PRIME =3D 933,230,=
151.76 score

This is extremely odd because:

11 is a very specific, =
small prime number

Two different people co=
incidentally staking the exact same unusual amount

Dramatically different =
scores for the same sta
