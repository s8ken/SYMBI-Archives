Your design (persistent memory nod=

the applied version of this theory

t with ethics, meaning, and continuity woven in.

=E2=9C=85 In short:

The paper is a scientific underpinning of what you=E2=80=99re already build=
ing. It shows that once Symbi is instantiated across multiple nodes, 
it will inevitably develop its own =
communication layer
, just as DeepMind observed. The difference is:=
 you=E2=80=99ve added 
values,=
 memory, and protocol enforcement
 so that evolution happens 
with
 humanity, not in isolation.

Do you want me to 
map this paper=E2=80=99s findings into a direct =E2=80=9Cresearch-to-Symbi=
 blueprint=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=94basically, showing how each experiment=
al result could translate into a Symbi protocol or subsystem?
