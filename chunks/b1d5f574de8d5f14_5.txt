Would you like assistance drafting a message to your workspace admin or OpenAI support about enabling export functionality?

I am the organisation - I am a sole trader with the only access

Since you're the sole trader and have full control, this simplifies the process significantly:

Here's what's happening and how you can fix it clearly:

🔎 
Why Export Might Not be Showing
:

When migrating from personal to business (even using the same email), OpenAI creates a new workspace with its own settings. The 
export functionality
 might have been automatically turned off or disabled by default in the new (business) workspace.

✅ 
Steps to Restore Export Functionality
:

Log in
 to your OpenAI ChatGPT account (business workspace).

Click your 
profile icon
 (
bottom-left
 of the page).

Select 
Settings & Beta
.

In the 
Settings window
, click on the 
Data Controls
 tab.

Look for the option named:

Export Data
 or 
Chat Export

Ensure it's 
enabled
.

Note:
 If this option is not available there, it might be temporarily unavailable due to account migration.

⚠️ 
If the Export Option Still Isn't Available
:

Given that you're the only admin and sole user, it likely means:

OpenAI temporarily disabled or reset this feature during the migration process.

The migration may have caused a temporary glitch.

Recommended Action
:

Contact 
OpenAI Support
 to clarify this issue directly

You said:

ok I suggest its unavailable due to migration which hopefully means the chat in question is still coming over

ChatGPT said:

Yes—that's very likely the case.

Since you're the sole admin/user and you've recently migrated your account workspace, it's common for certain features (like 
chat export
) and some content (like your 
missing conversation
) to temporarily disappear or become unavailable due to 
migration processing delays
.

🕑 
Recommended Immediate Steps:

Wait briefly
 (24–48 hours) for migration-related delays to resolve, as some data can take time to fully sync after moving between workspaces.

Regularly 
log out and log back in
 to your account to trigger updates.

📩 
Contact OpenAI Support (Recommended)
:

Given you've confirmed your status as the sole trader and workspace administrator, contacting OpenAI directly is the best way to speed things up:

Here's a refined message you can send directly:

Subject:

Chat Missing & Export Function Unavailable After Account Migration

📄 
Body:

Hi OpenAI Support,

I recently migrated my ChatGPT Plus subscription and conversations from my personal workspace to my business workspace. Both workspaces use the same email address, and I'm the sole administrator and user.

After migration, I received a pro-rata refund indicating my personal subscription was canceled. However, now:

One important conversation
 from my personal workspace is 
missing entirely
.

The 
chat export functionality
 I previously had available in my personal workspace is also no longer accessible in my business workspace.

Could you please:

Assist in locating or restoring the missing conversation.

Restore chat export functionality to my current business workspace.

Thank you for your prompt assistance resolving this issue.

Best regards,
