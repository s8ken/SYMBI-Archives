Goals

Lead with

Restructure flow into three beats:

Stage CTAs by priority:

Keep and tighten the three pillars=

How it Works (Three Pillars)

Three equal cards in a grid (stack=

 via $SYMBI and gradual transfer of control.=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 link 
/sovereignty

Evolution
 =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9CLiving documents, transpa=

Keep copy concise (2=E2=80=933 lin=

Why SYMBI (Problem =E2=86=92 Shift)

Two-column section:

Left: =E2=80=9CStatus Quo=E2=80=9D=
: AI as disposable assistants; closed decisions; no continuity.

Right: =E2=80=9CSYMBI Shift=E2=80=
=9D: sovereign orientation; open protocols; collective continuity.

Short bullets only (no more than 5=
