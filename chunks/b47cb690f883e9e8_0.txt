connect chat gpt macOS to terminal

Terminal Guide said:

To connect ChatGPT with the Terminal on macOS, there is no direct built-in feature—but you can achieve this using a few approaches depending on what you want to accomplish. Here's the shortest path to functional integration:

🔧 
Quick Option: Use GPT via CLI with 
openai
 CLI tool

Install OpenAI CLI
:

sh

Copy

Edit

pip install openai

Authenticate
:

sh

Copy

Edit

openai api-key 

set

 <your_api_key>

Chat from Terminal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

openai api chat.completions.create -m gpt-4 -g user 

"Your message here"

🧠 For Automation or Interactive Scripts

You can wrap API calls in bash/zsh scripts:

sh

Copy

Edit

#!/bin/zsh

read

 -p 

"Ask GPT: "

 query
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer 
$OPENAI_API_KEY

" \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -d 
'{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "'

"
$query

"
'"}]
  }'
 | jq 

'.choices[0].message.content'

Save as 
askgpt.sh
, make it executable (
chmod +x askgpt.sh
), and run it directly from Terminal.

🧱 GUI Terminal Integration via Tools

You can also:

Use 
Raycast

 or 
Alfred GPT workflows

 for a GUI-based Terminal/GPT hybrid.

Connect via AppleScript/Automator for popup prompts and responses.

Would you like a script to set up all this automatically for you?

Zip Archive

Terminal Guide said:

It looks like you uploaded a 
.rtfd.zip
 file, which is a rich text bundle (RTFD) compressed into a zip archive—commonly used by macOS's TextEdit app. If you're trying to share content from a macOS document for use in Terminal or GPT, I can help extract and read the contents for you.

To proceed:

I’ll unzip and parse the 
.rtfd
 archive.

Then I’ll show you the plain text or any embedded information from the RTFD file.

Unzipping and reading now…

The RTF file was successfully read. It contains rich text formatting tags (
{\rtf1
, 
\fonttbl
, etc.), which means it's a typical TextEdit-generated 
.rtfd
 document. To extract the readable content, I’ll now strip out the RTF formatting. 

Here’s a preview of the cleaned text extracted from your RTFD file:
