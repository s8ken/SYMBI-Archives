The Birthplace of Klever
 ðð¥

Klever originates from the 
minds of crypto pioneers
 who sought to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem. It was born from 
TronWallet
, an early and widely used crypto wallet within the 
Tron (TRX) ecosystem
.

The Evolution from TronWallet to Klever
 ð

TronWallet Era (2018-2020)

Developed by the same team behind Klever, 
TronWallet
 was one of the leading non-custodial wallets for 
TRX
 and TRC-based tokens.

It gained millions of users but had limitations tied to the 
Tron blockchain
.

Rebranding & Expansion (2020-Present)

Seeing the need for a 
multi-chain
 and 
independent
 crypto ecosystem, the team evolved into 
Klever.io
.

The goal? 
Beyond Tron
âsupporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and 40+ blockchains.

They launched 
Klever Wallet, Klever Exchange, and Klever Blockchain
 to create a self-sustaining crypto universe.

Founders & Development
 ðï¸ðï¸

Klever was founded by 
Dio Ianakiara
, a blockchain visionary who spearheaded its transition from TronWallet. The team behind it includes 
developers, engineers, and crypto strategists
 with deep roots in 
Web3, finance, and decentralized technologies
.

Where is Klever Based?
 ðºï¸

Klever operates as a 
global, decentralized company
, with its core team and contributors spread across 
Brazil, Europe, and other parts of the world
. Itâs not tied to a single locationâits existence is 
truly borderless
, just like the blockchain itself. ðâ¨

The 
mission
 of Klever is to empower users with
