Success! Java 11 (Zulu) is Installed!
 ð¥

Now that 
Zulu Java 11 is properly installed
, let's 
set it as the default
 and finally get 
Autopsy running
.

â Step 1: Set Java 11 as Default

Now, 
force macOS to always use Java 11
:

sh

Copy

Edit

export

 JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)

export

 PATH=

"
$JAVA_HOME

/bin:

$PATH

"

ð 
Make it permanent
 so it stays active after a reboot:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

â Step 2: Verify Java is Now Default

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

ð 
It must show:

nginx

Copy

Edit

openjdk

 version 

"11.0.26"

 Zulu ...

If it still shows another version, restart your terminal and check again.

â Step 3: Run Autopsy Again

Now, try launching 
Autopsy
 with the correct Java version:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy --jdkhome 

"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home"

ð 
Try it now and let me know if Autopsy finally runs! ð¥

ð¨ Autopsy Now Needs Java 17+ Instead of Java 11! ð¥

Good news: 
Autopsy is finally running!
 But now it's asking for 
Java 17 or higher
 instead of Java 11.

â Step 1: Install Zulu Java 17

Since we now need 
Java 17
, let's install it:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask zulu@17

After installation, verify it's there:

sh

Copy

Edit

/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java -version

ð 
Expected output:

nginx

Copy

Edit

openjdk

 version 

"17.0.X"

 Zulu ...

â Step 2: Set Java 17 as Default

Now, set Java 17 as your system's default:

sh

Copy

Edit

export

 JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)

export

 PATH=

"
$JAVA_HOME

/bin:

$PATH

"

ð 
Make it permanent:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

Now, verify Java 17 is active:

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

ð 
It should show Java 17.

â Step 3: Run Autopsy Again

Now that Java 17 is active, restart Autopsy:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy --jdkhome 

"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home"

ð 
This should finally get Autopsy fully running with all modules! ð¥
 Let me know if it works!
