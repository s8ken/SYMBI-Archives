ð Final Steps: What to Do If You Find Something Suspicious

Google the process name
 to see if it's legit.

Check where itâs running from
 using:

sh

Copy

Edit

which

 processname

Kill the process
 if it looks suspicious:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 PID

Delete any unknown startup services
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/com.suspicious.agent.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.suspicious.daemon.plist

Full system scan complete!
 ð¥

Results:

â 
No infected files found!

â ï¸ 
1924 errors detected
 (we might want to check those).

â³ 
Scan took ~50 minutes
, covering 
623,487 files
 and 
58GB of data
.

Whatâs Next? (Checking the Errors)

Even though no viruses were found, letâs 
review the 1924 errors
 to make sure nothing was skipped. Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log | grep 

"ERROR"

ð This will 
list all error messages
 from the scan.

Continue the Spyware & Remote Management Investigation

Now that ClamAV has ruled out known malware, letâs check for 
hidden spyware or remote access tools
.

1ï¸â£ Run a System Security Audit with Lynis

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install lynis
sudo lynis audit system

ð This will give us a 
security report
 listing 
misconfigurations, remote access risks, and vulnerabilities.

2ï¸â£ Scan for Hidden Startup Malware with KnockKnock

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

ð This will 
scan for hidden launch agents
 that persist after reboots.

3ï¸â£ Check for Unusual Outbound Connections with LuLu

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu
open /Applications/LuLu.app

ð LuLu will 
alert you in real-time
 if spyware is secretly sending data.

Final Step: Check for Errors & Report Findings

Run the error check command:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log | grep 

"ERROR"

ð 
Let me know what errors show up, and weâll troubleshoot them!

Alright! Since there's 
no ClamAV log file
, it means:

ClamAV 
did not save
 the error messages to a log file.

The errors might have been 
permissions-related
 (files it couldn't scan).

Step 1: Find Out What Went Wrong

Since there's no log file, let's check what 
ClamAV failed to scan
 by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep 

"ERROR"

ð This will 
list all error messages
 from the scan.

ð If the output is long, you can 
save it to a file
:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep 

"ERROR"

 > ~/clamav_errors.txt

Then, check the errors using:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/c
