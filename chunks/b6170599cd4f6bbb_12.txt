Step 2: Common Causes of ClamAV Errors

Permission Denied:
 ClamAV may not have access to certain system files.

Locked Files:
 Some files may be in use by macOS.

Symbolic Link Issues:
 Some directories might be unreadable due to symlinks.

If you see 
"Permission Denied"
 errors, try running:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo clamscan -r /

Step 3: (Optional) Enable Logging for Future Scans

If you'd like to 
enable logging
 for next time, create the log directory and file:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

mkdir

 -p /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav
sudo 

touch

 /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log
sudo 

chmod

 644 /opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log

Then, run ClamAV with logging enabled:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo clamscan -r / --

log

=/opt/homebrew/var/log/clamav/clamav.log

Next Steps

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep 

"ERROR"

ð 
Let me know what errors appear, and Iâll guide you through fixing them!

sja@SJAs-MacBook-Pro ~ % clamscan -r / 2>&1 | grep "ERROR"

/usr/share/httpd/error/HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.html.var: OK

Ah, interesting! 
No actual errors appeared
, except for the standard 
HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.html.var
 file, which is normal and 
not a real issue
. ð

What This Means:

ClamAV ran successfully
 but didnât save the errors to a log (which we can enable for next time).

The "Total Errors: 1924"
 from your scan report 
were likely just permission-denied errors
 for system-protected files.

There are no malware detections
âyour system is clean from known viruses! â

Whatâs Next? (Deep Spyware & Remote Management Check)

Since 
no traditional malware was found
, but you're concerned about 
rogue camera extensions, remote management, and screen capturing
, let's dig deeper using 
security auditing tools.

1ï¸â£ Check for Remote Management & Spyware with Lynis

ð This tool will 
audit your Macâs security
, checking for:

Remote access (SSH, VNC, Backdoors)

Weak permissions

Hidden rootkits or spyware

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install lynis
sudo lynis audit system

ð This will generate a 
detailed security report
 with warnings & recommendations.

ð Let me know what it finds! ðµï¸ââï¸

2ï¸â£ Detect Persistently Installed Malware with KnockKnock

ð 
KnockKnock
 scans your Mac for 
hidden startup malware
 that survives reboots.

Install & run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

ð 
Check for any unknown startup items
âif something looks sketchy, let me know!

3ï¸â£ Monitor for Unauthorized Camera/Microphone Access with OverSight

ð¸ð¤ If spyware is 
watching you or listening in
, 
OverSight
 will 
catch it
.

Install & run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask oversight
open /Applications/OverSight.app

ð 
If an unknown process tries to access your camera or mic, OverSight will warn you!

4ï¸â£ Track Suspicious Network Activity with LuLu

ð If hidden malware is 
sending data to a remote hacker
, 
LuLu
 will block it.

Install & run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu
open /Applications/LuLu.app

ð 
Allow LuLu to monitor all outbound connections
 and 
watch for unknown apps connecting to the internet
.

Final Thoughts

â 
ClamAV found no malware
âso thatâs a good sign!

ð 
Now, letâs check for hidden spyware, remote access tools, and suspicious network traffic.

ð 
Next Step: Run 
lynis audit system
 and let me know what it finds!
