 Still Not Loading â Next Steps ð¥

Your 
Java settings show 
/usr/local/lib
 is included
, but 
Autopsy still isn't finding 
libtsk_jni

. That suggests either:

1ï¸â£ 
Java isn't looking in the right place inside the JAR file
, or

2ï¸â£ 
There's a linking issue in 
libtsk_jni.dylib

Let's 
confirm and fix the root cause
.

â Step 1: Check 
libtsk_jni.dylib
 for Broken Dependencies

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

otool -L /usr/local/lib/libtsk_jni.dylib

ð 
If any line says "not found," we have a linking issue to fix.

â Step 2: Manually Force Java to Use the Right 
libtsk_jni.dylib
 Path

If 
libtsk_jni.dylib
 is in 
/usr/local/lib
, but Autopsy 
still can't find it
, try 
explicitly telling Java where it is
:

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

export

 JAVA_OPTS=

"-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib"

echo

'export JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

ð 
This forces Java to use 
/usr/local/lib
 every time.

Now, 
relaunch Autopsy
:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy --jdkhome 

"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home"

â Step 3: Check Inside Autopsy for the 
libtsk_jni
 Path

If it still fails, 
we need to check how Autopsy is looking for 
libtsk_jni

.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

grep -i 

"libtsk_jni"

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/autopsy/etc/autopsy.conf

ð If 
Autopsy has a hardcoded path
, we might need to 
edit the config file
 to match our library location.

ð If It Still Fails, Send Me This Output:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -l /usr/local/lib | grep libtsk
otool -L /usr/local/lib/libtsk_jni.dylib

echo

$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

grep -i 

"libtsk_jni"

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/autopsy/etc/autopsy.conf

ð 
This will confirm where Autopsy is looking and how to fix it.

ð 
Try these fixes and let me know what happens! ð¥

You said:

ok should we just uninstall everything and start again?

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ Full Reset & Clean Reinstall of Autopsy ð¥

Yeah, at this point, 
a clean start
 will be faster than debugging every single issue. Let's completely 
wipe everything
 and do a 
fresh install
.

ð¨ Step 1: Uninstall Everything (Autopsy, Java, Dependencies)

Run these commands 
one by one
 to remove everything related to Autopsy, Java, and its dependencies:

sh

Copy

Edit

# ð¥ Remove Autopsy

rm

 -rf ~/Downloads/autopsy-*

# ð¥ Uninstall Java (Zulu JDK)

brew uninstall --cask zulu@17
brew uninstall --cask zulu@11
brew uninstall openjdk@17
brew uninstall openjdk@11

# ð¥ Uninstall Homebrew dependencies

brew uninstall sleuthkit
brew uninstall libewf
brew uninstall afflib
brew uninstall openssl
brew uninstall sqlite

# ð¥ Remove leftover system libraries

sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/lib/libtsk*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/lib/libewf*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/lib/libafflib*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/lib/libcrypto*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/lib/libsqlite*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/local/javafx

ð 
Confirm the cleanup
 by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 /usr/local/lib | grep 

"libtsk\|libewf\|libafflib\
