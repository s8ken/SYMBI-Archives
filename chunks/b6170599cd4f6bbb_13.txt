Ah, I see! 
ClamAV is still running the full system scan
, and it's just printing out the files it checks. This is normal behavior. â¡

Options:

1ï¸â£ 
Let it finish
 â If you want to complete the scan, just let it run until it stops.

2ï¸â£ 
Cancel the scan
 â If youâre satisfied that ClamAV found no threats before, you can 
stop the scan
 by pressing:

objectivec

Copy

Edit

CTRL

 + C

Whatâs Next?

Since 
ClamAV already found no malware
, Iâd recommend moving on to:

â 
Lynis
 (
sudo lynis audit system
) â Security Audit

â 
KnockKnock
 (
brew install --cask knockknock
) â Detect Hidden Malware

â 
OverSight
 (
brew install --cask oversight
) â Monitor Camera/Mic

â 
LuLu
 (
brew install --cask lulu
) â Block Hidden Network Activity

ð 
Let me know which one you want to check first, and I'll guide you!

Alright, since 
ClamAV is still running
, it's normal to see those 
"OK" messages
âit's just showing files being scanned.

What You Can Do Now

1ï¸â£ 
If you want to stop the scan:

Press 

CTRL + C

 in the terminal to cancel it.

2ï¸â£ 
If you want to let it finish:

Just let it run; it might take 
hours
 depending on the number of files.

No Errors Found? Thatâs Good!

Your 
previous ClamAV scan found 0 infected files
.

No 
ERROR
 messages appeared, so 
there were no critical issues
.

Next Steps: Let's Hunt for Spyware & Remote Monitoring

Since ClamAV found 
no traditional viruses
, letâs check for 
hidden surveillance tools
:

1ï¸â£ Run a Security Audit with Lynis

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install lynis
sudo lynis audit system

ð This will 
scan your Mac for security weaknesses
, 
remote access services
, and 
misconfigured permissions
.

2ï¸â£ Detect Hidden Malware with KnockKnock

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

ð This tool will 
list all persistent startup malware
 that 
ClamAV might not detect
.

3ï¸â£ Monitor for Spyware Accessing Your Camera/Microphone

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask oversight
open /Applications/OverSight.app

ð 
If spyware is secretly using your mic or camera, OverSight will catch it.

4ï¸â£ Detect Hidden Outbound Traffic with LuLu

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu
open /Applications/LuLu.app

ð 
If any hidden malware is sending data over the internet, LuLu will warn you.

Final Step: Let Me Know What You Want to Do Next!

â If you want to 
stop the ClamAV scan
, press 

CTRL + C

.

â If you want to 
continue checking for spyware
, start with 
Lynis
 and tell me what it finds! ð

    Why do I see this error?
    -------------------------------
    This is a protection mechanism to prevent the root user from executing user created files. The files may be altered, or including malicious pieces of script.

    What can I do?
    ---------------------
    Option 1) Check if a trusted user created the files (e.g. due to using Git, Homebrew or similar).
              If you trust these files, you can decide to continue this run by pressin
