g ENTER.

    Option 2) Change ownership of the related files (or full directory).

       Commands (full directory):
         # cd ..
         # chown -R 0:0 lynis
         # cd lynis
         # ./lynis audit system

Ah, you've encountered 
Lynisâ security check
, which is preventing execution because some files 
arenât owned by the root user
. This is a safeguard against 
malicious script execution
.

What To Do Next?

You have 
two options
:

Option 1: Trust the Files & Continue

If you trust these files (since they came from Homebrew), simply 
press ENTER
 and let the scan continue.

Option 2: Fix Ownership (Recommended for Future Runs)

If you donât want to see this warning again, change the ownership of the Lynis directory so it belongs to 
root
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chown

 -R 0:0 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/lynis

cd

 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/lynis
sudo ./lynis audit system

Which Option Should You Choose?

â 
If you want a quick scan
, just 
press ENTER
 and let it run.

â 
If you want to permanently fix this issue
, use 
Option 2
.

Let me know what you choose and what 
Lynis finds
! ð
