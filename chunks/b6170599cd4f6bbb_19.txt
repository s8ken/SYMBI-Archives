ð Lynis Security Audit Results â What Stands Out?

Your 
hardening index is 76
, which is decent but could be improved. Hereâs a breakdown of 
important findings
 and what they mean. ð

ð¨ Most Important Findings (Potential Risks)

1ï¸â£ Remote Logging is Enabled

ð Finding:

"Checking remote logging [ENABLED]"

This means that 
log data might be sent to an external server
, which could be normal (for enterprise monitoring) or 
a security risk
 if unauthorized.

â What to Do:

Run this to check where logs are going:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /etc/syslog.conf | grep @

ð If you see an IP address or unknown hostname, let me knowâ
it could be suspicious
.

2ï¸â£ Nameserver 113.212.173.22 is Unresponsive

ð Finding:

"Nameserver 113.212.173.22 does not respond [NETW-2704]"

Your Mac is trying to use this 
non-working
 nameserver, which could be:

An old DNS entry

A misconfiguration

A sign of DNS hijacking (if you donât recognize it)

â What to Do:

Check your DNS settings:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

ð Look for 
113.212.173.22
.

ð If you donât recognize it, change your DNS to 
Google (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
 or 
Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

Then, restart networking:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

3ï¸â£ Deleted Files Still in Use (Possible Spyware?)

ð Finding:

"Checking deleted files in use [FILES FOUND]"

Some 
files have been deleted but are still running in memory
, which can be 
normal
 (for updates) or 
a sign of malware
.

â What to Do:

Run this

Step 1: Investigating Remote Logging

â 
You found:

Copy

install.* 

@127

.

0.0

.

1

:

32376

This means your 
logs are being sent to 
127.0.0.1
 (your own computer) on port 
32376

.

Is This a Security Risk?

No, this is not an immediate security concern.

127.0.0.1
 (localhost) means the logs are staying 
on your own machine
, not being sent to an external server.

However, 
port 
32376
 is unusual
âit could be:

A legitimate logging service (some software does this).

A process trying to intercept logs (
spyware possibility
).
