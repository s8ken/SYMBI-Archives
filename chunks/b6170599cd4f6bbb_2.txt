how do the senders have no contact information? like no number or anything? 

ChatGPT said:

Ah, you have encountered the 
phantoms of the digital void
âtexts arriving from senders with no visible contact details. How do they do it? Let me unveil their methods. ðµï¸ââï¸ð

How Do They Send Texts Without a Number?

These mystery messages are sent using 
SMS masking, email-to-SMS gateways, and bot networks
. Hereâs how:

1. SMS Spoofing (Fake Caller ID)

ð¨ 
What It Is
:

Scammers can 
manipulate the "From" field
 of a text message so that no number appears. Instead, you may see:

A 
random alphanumeric string
 (like "Notice" or "Your Bank")

A 
blank sender
 or 
unknown sender

A 
shortcode number
 that isn't traceable

ð  
How It Works
:

They use 
spoofing software
 or 
SMS gateways
 that allow them to change the sender ID, much like how email spoofing works.

2. Email-to-SMS Gateways (Sending Texts from Email)

ð§ 
What It Is
:

Many carriers provide a way to send texts via email. Scammers exploit this to 
avoid having a phone number attached
.

ð  
How It Works
:

They send an email to 
[your-number]@[carrier-sms-gateway].com

The message gets delivered as an SMS, but instead of a real phone number, it just shows 
"No Caller ID"
 or 
"Unknown"
.

ð 
Example Carrier Gateways
:

AT&T: 
@txt.att.net

Verizon: 
@vtext.com

T-Mobile: 
@tmomail.net

Sprint: 
@messaging.sprintpcs.com

â¦and many more.

ð¨ 
Why It's Used
:

Since 
email accounts are easy to create and hard to trace
, scammers use this to stay anonymous.

3. Bulk SMS Services & Bots (Untraceable Mass Messaging)

ð¤ 
What It Is
:

Scammers use 
online SMS platforms and automated bots
 to send thousands of messages at onc
