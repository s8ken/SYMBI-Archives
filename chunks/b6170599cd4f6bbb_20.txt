o see which process is listening on port 
32376
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :32376

ð This will 
show the name and path of the program
 using that port.

2ï¸â£ If Itâs Suspicious, Kill It

If the program looks 
unknown or suspicious
, kill it with:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual 
process ID
 from the 
lsof
 command).

3ï¸â£ (Optional) Disable Remote Logging Completely

If you donât want 
any local logging over a network port
, remove it from 
syslog.conf
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /etc/syslog.conf

Find this line:

graphql

Copy

Edit

install.* 

@127

.

0.0

.

1

:

32376

Delete the line
, then 
save and exit
 (
CTRL + X
, 
Y
, 
Enter
).

Restart the logging service:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl stop com.apple.syslogd
sudo launchctl start com.apple.syslogd

ð Next Step

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :32376

ð 
Tell me what process is using the port!
 If it looks suspicious, weâll investigate further. ð

Step 1 Result: No Process Found on Port 32376

â Your command returned 
nothing
, which means 
no active process is currently listening on port 32376
.

What This Means:

1ï¸â£ 
The log entry might be old
 â The system was previously sending logs to 
127.0.0.1:32376
, but whatever was using that port 
is no longer active
.

2ï¸â£ 
It could be an inactive or hidden service
 â Some malware can start and stop processes dynamically.

3ï¸â£ 
It might be from an old software installation
 â A program might have configured syslog to log to 
localhost:32376
, but itâs not actually running.

What To Do Next:

1ï¸â£ Check for Any References to Port 32376 in System Files

Letâs check if any 
configuration files
 are still pointing to this port:

sh

Copy

Edit

grep -r 

"32376"

 /etc /var 2>/dev/null

ð This searches for 
any system file
 mentioning 
32376
.

2ï¸â£ (Optional) Remove The Logging Entry

If you donât want logs going to 
127.0.0.1:32376
, you can 
remove the syslog entry
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /etc/syslog.conf

Find this line:

graphql

Copy

Edit

install.* 

@127

.

0.0

.

1

:

32376

Delete it
.

Save and exit
 (
CTRL + X
, 
Y
, 
Enter
).

Restart the syslog service:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl stop com.apple.syslogd
sudo launchctl start com.apple.syslogd

ð Next Step

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

grep -r 

"32376"

 /etc /var 2>/dev/null

ð 
Let me know if it finds anything!
 If nothing is found, we can move on to the 
next issue (DNS check).

Step 1 Complete: Remote Logging Entry Removed
 â

Since:

Nothing was found
 in 
/etc
 or 
/var
 referencing 
32376
,

No process was running on that port
,

You restarted syslog
,

â That means the logging to 
127.0.0.1:32376
 is now gone! ð

Step 2: Investigate the Suspicious Nameserver

ð Check Current DNS Configuration

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

ð 
Look for 
113.212.173.22
 in the output.
 If it appears under 
resolver #X
, let me know.

ð If That Nameserver is Found & You Donât Recognize It

You can change your DNS to a 
trusted provider
 (Google or Cloudflare):

Set DNS to Google (8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

Flush DNS Cache to Apply Changes

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

Then, check your DNS again:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

ð Next Step: Run 
scutil --dns
 and Tell Me if 
113.212.173.22
 is Still There

ð If itâs gone, we move to the next check (deleted files still in use). If itâs still there, weâll dig deeper. ð
