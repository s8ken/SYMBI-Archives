ð Final Verdict: No Suspicious Active Connections Found! ð

â 
All detected IPs belong to trusted companies: Apple, Google, Cloudflare, ProtonVPN.

â 
No unknown or suspicious connections to remote servers detected.

ð  Next Steps (Optional Security Enhancements)

If you want to 
monitor connections in real time
 or set up alerts for unknown IPs, you can:

1ï¸â£ 
Use LuLu Firewall
 to block unknown outbound connections:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu

LuLu
 will notify you if an unknown app tries to connect to the internet.

2ï¸â£ 
Run KnockKnock to scan for persistent malware:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

It checks for 
hidden malware that launches at startup.

ð¯ Summary of What Weâve Accomplished:

â 
Removed a suspicious DNS hijack (
113.212.173.22
)

â 
Confirmed no malware is running from deleted files

â 
Checked network connectionsâALL are from safe sources

ð 
Your Mac looks clean and secure!
 If you want to go deeper, we can check for 
keyloggers, hidden screen recorders, or unauthorized remote access tools.

ð Is the Google Connection (
142.250.70.164.443
) Suspicious?

Since you're 
not logged into Google services
, it might seem odd that your Mac is still connected to 
Google IPs
. However, this 
isn't necessarily a security risk
. Let's break it down:

ð¡ï¸ Why Might Your Mac Connect to Google?

1ï¸â£ 
Chrome or Chromium-based Browsers (Even in Background)

Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Vivaldi
 may be making 
background connections
 to check for:

Safe Browsing updates (malware protection).

Automatic updates for the browser itself.

Extensions calling Google services.

Check if Chrome is running in the background
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep 

"Chrome"

If it shows up, you can 
force close Chrome
 and run 
netstat
 again:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall 

"Google Chrome"

2ï¸â£ 
Google DNS

You recently 
set your DNS to 
8.8.8.8
 and 
8.8.4.4

, which means 
your Mac queries Googleâs DNS servers
.

Even if you're not logged into Google, your device 
still makes connections to resolve domain names.

Want to avoid Google DNS?
 You can switch to Cloudflareâs DNS:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers 

"USB 10/100/1000 LAN"

 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1

3ï¸â£ 
macOS System Services

Some macOS 
background processes
 (like Captive Portal detection) may ping Google servers.

Try running:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

This will tell us 
which process is making the connection.

4ï¸â£ 
Any Installed Apps Using Google APIs

Some apps (even non-Google ones) use 
Google Cloud Services
 or 
Google Firebase
 for:

Push notifications

Analytics

Cloud sync

ð ï¸ What To Do Next

ð¹ 
If you want to investigate further, run this command
 to check 
which app is making the Google connection
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

ð 
Let me know what app shows up, and weâll decide if itâs normal or suspicious.
