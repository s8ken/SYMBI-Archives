ð No Chrome Running â But Still Google Connections?

â 
You confirmed that Chrome is NOT running
, but your Mac 
still has an active connection to 
142.250.70.164
 (Google-owned server).

That means 
something else
 is making that request.

ð  Step 1: Find the Process Making the Google Connection

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

ð 
This will show the exact process that is talking to Google.

Possible Causes (If Not Chrome)

1ï¸â£ 
A Background macOS Service

macOS sometimes 
pings Google servers
 to check internet connectivity.

Process to look for:

configd
 (networking), 
trustd
 (certificate validation).

2ï¸â£ 
An App Using Google Services

Some non-Google apps 
use Google APIs for syncing or analytics.

Examples:
 Slack, Discord, Spotify, etc.

3ï¸â£ 
A Hidden Background Process

If an unknown process is making the connection, 
we need to investigate further
.

ð Next Step: Run the 
lsof
 Command & Tell Me What Process is Making the Connection

Once we know 
which app is responsible
, we can decide if it's 
safe or suspicious.

â No Process Found â What Does This Mean?

You ran:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

â¦and 
nothing showed up
, meaning:

1ï¸â£ 
Your Mac is no longer actively connected to Google at this moment.

2ï¸â£ The previous connection to 
142.250.70.164

was temporary
 (likely a system service or app that no longer needs it).

3ï¸â£ If it was 
malicious
, it 
isnât running anymore
, so thereâs no immediate risk.

ð  Want to Keep Monitoring?

If you want to 
catch future connections in real-time
, use this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
Run it periodically to check for new active connections.

ð Final Check â Do You Want to Hunt for Hidden Processes?

If you 
still feel suspicious
, we can:

Run KnockKnock
 to find hidden startup malware:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

Use LuLu to monitor outbound connections in real-time:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask lulu

LuLu will alert you
 whenever an unknown app tries to connect to the internet.

Final Verdict: Youâre in the Clear! ð

â 
No active connections to Google right now.

â 
No Chrome running.

â 
MacOS looks clean & no malware found.

Let me know if you want to do any extra deep scans or if this closes the case!

ð Final Lynis Hardening Review â What's Left to Improve?

Your 
Lynis security audit
 scored 
76
, which is good, but we can still improve your Mac's security by addressing the remaining 
warnings and suggestions
 from the scan.

ð Remaining Lynis Hardening Recommendations

Here are the key security improvements Lynis suggested:

1ï¸â£ Strengthen Home Directory Permissions

ð Issue:

"Double check the permissions of home directories as some might be not strict enough. [HOME-9304]"

ð  Fix:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 700 /Users/*

ð This 
locks down all home directories
, making them accessible 
only to their owner
.

2ï¸â£ Protect the 
/etc/sudoers.d
 Directory

ð Issue:

"Permissions for directory: /etc/sudoers.d [WARNING]"

ð  Fix:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 750 /etc/sudoers.d

ð This prevents unauthorized users from modifying 
sudo permissions
.

3ï¸â£ Enable Password Strength Checking

ð Issue:

"Install a PAM module for password strength testing like 
pam_cracklib
 or 
pam_passwdqc
. [AUTH-9262]"

ð  Fix:

Install 
password policy enforcement
 on macOS:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/passwd

ð Add this line 
at the bottom
