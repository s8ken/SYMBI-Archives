that's great - back to that virus scanner - how do I make it do a full system scan daily?

ð  Automate Daily Full System Scans with ClamAV ð¡ï¸

Now that your system is secure, letâs schedule 
ClamAV to run a full system scan every day automatically.
 ð ð

ð Step 1: Create a Daily Scan Script

1ï¸â£ Open Terminal and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/daily_clamav_scan.sh

2ï¸â£ 
Paste this script inside the file:

sh

Copy

Edit

#!/bin/bash

# Update ClamAV virus database

sudo freshclam

# Run full system scan and log results

sudo clamscan -r --bell --

log

=/var/log/clamav/daily_scan.log /

# Remove old logs (older than 7 days)

find /var/log/clamav/ -

type

 f -name 

"*.log"

 -mtime +7 -

exec

rm

 {} \;

3ï¸â£ 
Save & exit:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
ENTER
.

ð Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 +x /usr/local/bin/daily_clamav_scan.sh

ð This allows the script to be executed.

ð Step 3: Schedule the Script to Run Daily

We will use 
cron
 (macOSâs task scheduler) to run this script every day at 
midnight
.

1ï¸â£ Open the cron editor:

sh

Copy

Edit

crontab -e

2ï¸â£ Add this line 
at the bottom
 of the file:

ruby

Copy

Edit

0

0

 * * * 

/usr/local

/bin/daily

_clamav_scan.sh

ð 
This means:
 Run the scan 
every day at 12:00 AM
.

3ï¸â£ 
Save & exit:

If using 
nano
, press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
ENTER
.

ð Step 4: Verify the Cron Job is Active

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

crontab -l

ð You should see:

ruby

Copy

Edit

0

0

 * * * 

/usr/local

/bin/daily

_clamav_scan.sh

â 
If it appears, your daily virus scan is now scheduled!
 ð

ð Step 5: View Scan Logs (Check Results)

To see if ClamAV has detected anything, you can check the log:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /var/log/clamav/daily_scan.log

ð This will show the 
latest scan results
.
