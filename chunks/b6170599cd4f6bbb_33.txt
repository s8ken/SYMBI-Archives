 to system settings.

macOS security restrictions
 (e.g., System Integrity Protection) are triggering the prompt.

ð  What to Do Next

1ï¸â£ Did This Happen After Running 
crontab -e
 or Another Command?

If so, it's 
normal
âcron jobs sometimes need admin access.

ð Safe to Allow?

â If you recognize the command you just ran, 
click "OK"
 to grant Terminal access.

â If this request appeared 
randomly or unexpectedly
, click 
"Don't Allow"
 and let's investigate.

2ï¸â£ Check Whatâs Requesting Admin Access

Before clicking 
"OK"
, let's check 
what process is asking
.

ð¹ Run this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"cron|clamav|sudo"

ð This will list 
active system processes
 related to cron jobs, ClamAV, or any 
sudo
 command.

3ï¸â£ If You Didnât Expect This Prompt

If 
this request seems suspicious
, check the 
macOS security logs
 for recent admin access attempts:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.securityd"'

 --last 5m

ð This shows 
security-related events from the last 5 minutes
.

ð What to Do Based on Your Findings

â 
If itâs related to ClamAV, cron, or a command you just ran â Click "OK".

ð 
If an unknown process is requesting admin access â Click "Don't Allow" and investigate further.

ð 
Run 
ps aux
 & 
log show
, and let me know what you find!

ð Why Did Terminal Ask for Admin Access After 
:wq
?

Since you just 
saved and exited 
crontab -e

, macOS likely prompted you for admin permissions because:

You modified a system-level cron job.

Your current user needs elevated privileges to schedule tasks in cron.

macOS security settings (System Integrity Protection - SIP) require confirmation for modifying system services.

â What You Should Do

1ï¸â£ 
If you trust this action (which we expect because you edited the crontab), click "OK."

This will allow macOS to save and apply the cron job.

2ï¸â£ 
If you're unsure, check your crontab file to verify that it saved correctly:

sh

Copy

Edit

crontab -l

If you see 
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/daily_clamav_scan.sh
, everything is fine. â

3ï¸â£ 
If You Clicked "Don't Allow" & It Didn't Save

Run 
crontab -e
 again and re-add the scheduled job:

ruby

Copy

Edit

0

0

 * * * 

/usr/local

/bin/daily

_clamav_scan.sh

Save and exit again (
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
ENTER
 if using nano).

ð Final Check: Confirm That the Daily Scan is Scheduled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

crontab -l

ð If the scheduled job appears, 
youâre all set!
 ð

ð Let me know if everything saved correctly, or if you need to troubleshoot further! ðð

ð  Final Check (Optional)

If you want to 
test the scheduled scan manually
, you can run:
