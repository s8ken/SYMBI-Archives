ð  LuLu Firewall â Best Configuration for Maximum Security
 ð¥ð

Since you 
already have LuLu installed
, let's configure it properly to 
block suspicious network activity while keeping normal apps working.

ð Step 1: Open LuLu & Check Running Rules

1ï¸â£ Open 
LuLu
 from 
Applications
 or run:

sh

Copy

Edit

open /Applications/LuLu.app

2ï¸â£ Click on 
"Rules"
 (top menu bar)

3ï¸â£ 
Review the existing rules
:

â 
Default Apple services should be allowed
 (e.g., 
trustd
, 
configd
, 
apsd
).

ð 
Any unknown apps trying to send data? Investigate them.

ð Step 2: Set LuLu to Alert for New Outbound Connections

1ï¸â£ Go to 
LuLu â Preferences

2ï¸â£ Set 
"Block by default"
 for all unknown connections.

3ï¸â£ Enable 
notifications for new connections
 so you can approve/deny them.

ð 
Now, every time an app tries to send data, LuLu will notify you!

ð Step 3: Manually Block Unwanted Apps

1ï¸â£ Open 
LuLu â Rules
