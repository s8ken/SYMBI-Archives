ð  Configuring Do Not Disturb, OverSight & Wireshark for Maximum Security
 ðð

ð¥ 
Great choices!
 These tools 
add extra layers of protection
 against spyware, keyloggers, unauthorized camera/mic access, and network monitoring. Letâs configure them 
correctly
 for 
maximum security
.

ð Step 1: Configure "Do Not Disturb" (Blocks Physical Access)

ð 
Do Not Disturb
 detects 
unauthorized physical access
 attempts, such as someone opening your Mac while you're away.

ð  Setup:

1ï¸â£ Open 
Do Not Disturb
 (
Applications â Do Not Disturb.app
)

2ï¸â£ 
Enable alerts for lid opening events.

3ï¸â£ 
Set it to "Notify me on another device."

If you have an iPhone
, enable notifications so you get an alert 
if someone opens your laptop lid while youâre away.

4ï¸â£ 
Enable "Capture images when triggered."

If your MacBook is opened without your permission, it will 
take a picture of the intruder.

â 
Your Mac will now alert you if someone physically tries to access it!

ð Step 2: Configure "OverSight" (Detect Hidden Camera & Mic Access)

ð 
OverSight
 protects against 
spyware that secretly uses your camera & microphone.

ð  Setup:

1ï¸â£ Open 
OverSight
 (
Applications â OverSight.app
)

2ï¸â£ 
Enable alerts for mic & camera access

ð 
If any unknown app tries to access your mic/camera, OverSight will notify you!

3ï¸â£ 
Review any apps that already have access.

If you 
donât recognize something
, block it!

â 
Now, no app can secretly record you without triggering an alert!

ð Step 3: Configure "Wireshark" (Network Monitoring & Traffic Analysis)

ð 
Wireshark
 is an advanced tool that allows you to 
see all network traffic going in/out of your Mac
. Itâs useful for detecting 
spyware, keyloggers, or suspicious connections
.

ð  Setup:

1ï¸â£ Open 
Wireshark
 (
Applications â Wireshark.app
)

2ï¸â£ Click 
"Capture" â "Options"

3ï¸â£ Select 
your active network interface
 (
en0
 for Wi-Fi, 
en4
 for Ethernet)

4ï¸â£ Click 
"Start Capture"

5ï¸â£ Let it run for a few minutes, then 
stop the capture & analyze traffic

Look for unknown IPs or repeated connections to servers you donât recognize.

If you see a 
strange domain or IP
, investigate further with:

sh

Edit

whois [IP_ADDRESS]

â 
Wireshark now lets you monitor network traffic for anything suspicious!

ð Final Security Checklist

â 
LuLu is blocking unknown network connections.

â 
Do Not Disturb alerts you to physical access attempts.

â 
OverSight prevents hidden mic/camera activation.

â 
Wireshark lets you analyze all network activity.

â 
Your Mac is now a fortress.
