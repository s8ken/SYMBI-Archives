You've got a solid set of security tools installed: 
LuLu, Do Not Disturb, Oversight, and Wireshark
. Let's go through how to configure them properly.

1. LuLu â Configuring the Firewall

LuLu is a firewall that blocks unknown outbound connections.

Set up rules for maximum security:

Open LuLu.

Click on 
Rules
.

Review existing rules â remove any unnecessary ones.

Set rules to 
Block All Unknown Connections
:

Click 
Preferences
 â 
Block Unknown Connections
.

This ensures any new outgoing connection needs

can you check this output from Wireshark?

I've analyzed the output from Wireshark. Here are some observations and recommendations based on the packet capture:

1. Suspicious Traffic

Frequent connections to IPs outside your network

Example: 
b9|46|2a|2b
 and 
11|f8|9b|c4

This could indicate potential C2 (Command and Control) traffic or unauthorized data exfiltration.

Unusual Multicast Traffic (
01|00|5e|7f|ff|fa
)

This is an IPv4 multicast address; common for network services, but could be used for network discovery or lateral movement in an attack.

If you donât recognize the device sending these, monitor it.

DNS Traffic to External Servers (
113.212.173.22
 previously found)

This was changed, but worth investigating if any DNS queries are still going to unknown servers.

2. Possible Remote Administration Tools (RATs)

TCP connections to high random ports (
58256
, 
58258
)

Could be part of a remote desktop or RAT.

Verify active connections with:

sh

Copy

Edit

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Encrypted Traffic to Cloudflare IPs (
104.18.32.47
, 
104.18.41.158
)

Cloudflare can be a CDN or a cover for malicious traffic.

Check your open browser tabs, VPN, or proxy settings.

3. Next Steps

Run a Deeper Analysis

Check running processes
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i remote
ps aux | grep -i agent

Verify active network connections
:

sh

Copy

Edit

lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

Scan for known malware with ClamAV
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo clamscan -r / --bell --

log

=/var/log/clamav_scan.log

Use Wireshark filters to isolate suspicious activity
:

tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==1
 â Find established connections

ip.addr == <suspicious IP>
 â Track specific connections

Monitor outbound traffic using LuLu
:

Set it to block unknown outbound connections.

Log everything and review whatâs trying to access the internet.

Conclusion

If you see 
continuous outbound traffic to unrecognized IPs
, you may have 
a backdoor, a trojan, or unauthorized remote access
.

The multicast and Cloudflare connections should be examined further. 
Are you using a VPN or proxy?
 If not, itâs worth digging into.

Enable Oversight to monitor camera/microphone access
 and check for unauthorized remote sessions.

Let me know if you want to 
deepen the investigation
 with further Wireshark filtering! ð

ð VPN Not Running, But Cloudflare & Suspicious Traffic Found â Possible Remote Access?

Since 
your VPN isnât running
, but we still see outbound connections to 
Cloudflare IPs (
104.18.32.47
, 
104.18.41.158
)
 and 
high-numbered ports (
58256
, 
58258
)
, this 
could be a sign of:

1ï¸â£ 
A backdoor or Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
 secretly exfiltrating data.

2ï¸â£ 
A hidden service using Cloudflare as a proxy
 (some malware does this to hide its C2 server).

3ï¸â£ 
A misconfigured system process reaching out unnecessarily
 (less likely).

ð Next Steps â Letâs Investigate Further

Now that we suspect 
possible unauthorized remote access
