ð No Active Network Connections Found â What This Means

â You ran:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

â¦and 
nothing appeared

ð Next Steps â Letâs Dig Deeper

Even though no active connections 
right now
, we should still check 
if anything left traces behind.

Sounds like a great plan! ð

ð  Steps for a 60-Second Wireshark Capture

1ï¸â£ 
Open Wireshark

2ï¸â£ 
Start a new capture
 on your active network interface:

en0
 (Wi-Fi)
 or 

en4
 (Ethernet)

3ï¸â£ Let it run for 
60 seconds

4ï¸â£ 
Stop the capture

5ï¸â£ 
Save the capture as a 
.pcapng
 or 
.txt
 file

6ï¸â£ Upload the file here, and Iâll analyze it for any 
suspicious connections or remote access attempts
.

ð 
Tip:
 While capturing, avoid opening websites or apps so we only catch background traffic.
