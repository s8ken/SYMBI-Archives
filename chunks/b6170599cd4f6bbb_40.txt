ð Reverse Lookup for 
151.101.3.6
 â No Domain Found (
NXDOMAIN
)

Your 

dig -x 151.101.3.6

 request returned 
NXDOMAIN
 (Non-Existent Domain), meaning:

The IP is valid but does not resolve to a known hostname.

It belongs to an organization that does not publicly expose reverse DNS records.

It could be a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Fastly or Cloudflare, often used by websites & apps.

ð  Next Steps â Letâs Investigate Further

â 
Run 
dig
 for the second IP (
185.70.42.22
)

sh

Copy

Edit

dig -x 185.70.42.22

ð This will check if the 
second IP has an identifiable hostname.

â 
Check If Any Process Is Using These IPs

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 151.101.3.6
sudo lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22

ð 
This tells us which app is responsible for these connections.

â 
Use 
whois
 from an External Source (If macOS Blocks It)

Since 
whois
 timed out earlier, try using 
an online WHOIS lookup tool
:

ð¹ 
For 
151.101.3.6

 â 
WHOIS Lookup

ð¹ 
For 
185.70.42.22

 â 
WHOIS Lookup

ð If 
151.101.3.6
 is a 
CDN like Fastly, Cloudflare, or Akamai
, itâs likely safe.

ð If 

185.70.42.22
 is unknown
, we should 
block it in LuLu until we confirm itâs safe
.

ð Next Step: Run 
dig -x 185.70.42.22
 and 
lsof
 & Let Me Know What You Find!

ð If 
an unknown process is using these IPs
, weâll find and block it. ð

ð Reverse Lookup for 
185.70.42.22
 â Belongs to ProtonMail (
protonmail.ch
)

Your 

dig -x 185.70.42.22

 request confirms that this IP belongs to 
ProtonMail
 (ð¨ð­ Switzerland).

ð  What This Means

â 
If you use ProtonMail or ProtonVPN
, this IP is likely a 
Proton service checking for updates or handling encrypted mail traffic
.

â 
If you donât use ProtonMail/VPN right now
, itâs worth investigating 
why your Mac is still connecting to Proton servers.

ð Next Steps â Letâs Confirm Whatâs Using ProtonMailâs IP

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22

ð This will 
show the exact process or app
 on your Mac making connections to ProtonMail.

ð Should You Block This IP?

â 
If youâre actively using ProtonMail or ProtonVPN
 â 
No action needed
 (expected behavior).

â 
If you arenât running ProtonVPN/Mail right now
 â 
Possible hidden process or residual connection.

Check running ProtonVPN processes:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i proton

If ProtonVPN is 
not running
, but this connection is 
active
, consider 
blocking it in LuLu
:

Open LuLu â Rules

Block outgoing connections
 for 
185.70.42.22
.

Apply & Save.

ð Next Steps:

ð¹ 
Run 
lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22
 & Let Me Know What Process is Using It!

ð¹ If ProtonVPN 
isnât running
, weâll check for 
stealth processes
 using this connection. ðð

yes I use protonmail

ChatGPT said:

â ProtonMail Connection is Expected â No Immediate Concern!
 ð

Since you 
use ProtonMail
, the connection to 
185.70.42.22

is normal
 and not a security risk. Itâs likely:

Your email client syncing with ProtonMail servers

Background checks for Proton services

ProtonVPN (if youâve used it recently, even if itâs off now, residual connections may exist)

ð  Final Security Check (Optional)

If you 
want to ensure nothing else is secretly using ProtonMail servers
, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22

ð This will show if 
any unexpected process
 (outside of ProtonMail apps) is
