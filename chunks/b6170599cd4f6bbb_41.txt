If everything looks fine, youâre fully secure! ð

ð 
Want to analyze network traffic further? Letâs set up real-time monitoring in Wireshark or LuLu.

ð 
Want to tweak firewall rules? We can fine-tune LuLu to only allow ProtonMail connections while blocking unknown services.

Let me know if you want any final optimizations, or if we can 
officially call this mission complete!

No current process is actively communicating with ProtonMailâs servers.

2ï¸â£ The previous connection was 
likely temporary (email sync or ProtonVPN check-in).

3ï¸â£ 
Your system is clean â no hidden or unauthorized ProtonMail-related traffic.

ð Goal: Completely Block Remote Access & Unwanted Connections

Since 
you are the sole user of this machine
, let's ensure 
NO unauthorized remote access
 is possible. ð«ð

ð Step 1: Disable ALL Remote Management Services

â 
Turn off Remote Login (SSH)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

â 
Turn off Screen Sharing & Remote Management

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.RemoteManagement

â 
Turn off AirDrop & Bluetooth Sharing (Optional)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool YES
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.bluetoothd

ð 
This ensures nobody can remotely access your Mac over SSH, screen sharing, or AirDrop.

ð Step 2: Block ALL Remote Desktop & Remote Control Software

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep -E 

"vnc|rdp|teamviewer|anydesk|logmein"

ð If 
ANYTHING shows up
, let me know â we will 
remove and block it
.

ð Step 3: Block ALL Incoming Connections (Firewall)

â 
Enable macOS Stealth Mode (Blocks Ping & Network Scanning)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on

â 
Block ALL incoming connections (even from known apps)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setblockall on

ð 
This means:
 Even if an app is allowed internet access, it 
cannot
 receive incoming connections.

ð Step 4: Lock Down Outbound Traffic (LuLu Firewall)

Since 
you only want ProtonDrive & ProtonMail
, block EVERYTHING except those services.

ð  LuLu Setup

1ï¸â£ Open 
LuLu
 â 
Rules

2ï¸â£ 
Delete all existing "Allow" rules
 (except ProtonDrive & ProtonMail).

3ï¸â£ 
Set it to block ALL unknown outgoing connections by default.

4ï¸â£ 
Manually allow only these:

ProtonMail

ProtonDrive
