ð Final Verification â Run This Last Check

To 
confirm that no services are listening for remote access
, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð This will show 
if anything is still accepting incoming connections
.

ð If 
nothing unexpected
 appears, your Mac is 
fully remote-proof!
 ð

â Final Security Status: Your Mac is Now Remote-Access Proof

ð¡ 
No remote login (SSH, RDP, VNC)

ð 
No unauthorized user accounts

ðµï¸ 
Firewall blocks ALL inbound connections

ð 
No active remote control software

ð 
Mac is invisible to network scans (Stealth Mode On)

ð¥ 
Mission Accomplished â You Now Have a Fully Locked-Down Mac!
 ð

Let me know if 
anything still shows up in 
netstat
,
 or if we can officially close this case! ðð

ð Unexpected Open Ports Found â Letâs Investigate!

Your output shows 
three active listening ports:

.*                    LISTEN

â These 
are still listening for incoming connections
, meaning 
something is running that can accept remote access.

ð¨ 
We need to find out which processes are responsible for these ports.

ð Step 1: Find Which Process Owns These Ports

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :49172
sudo lsof -i :5000
sudo lsof -i :7000

ð This will show 
which applications or services are using these ports.

ð Step 2: If These Are Unwanted, Kill Them

Once you find the 
process ID (PID)
 from the previous step, kill the process:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

ð Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual process ID.

ð Step 3: Disable Any Startup Services Running on These Ports

If these processes restart after you kill them, 
they might be running as background daemons.

To check startup services:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"49172|5000|7000"

ð If any service appears, 
disable it with:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/[service_name]

ð¹ Replace 
[service_name]
 with the actual service name.

ð Step 4: Block These Ports in the Firewall

Since you donât want 
ANY
 incoming connections, block these ports in the firewall:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockApp /usr/local/bin/[app_name]

ð¹ Replace 
[app_name]
 with the actual app 
found in 
lsof
 results.

ð Next Step: Run 
lsof
 & Tell Me Whatâs Using These Ports!

ð 
If they are normal system services, we can decide if they should stay.

ð 
If they are unknown, we will kill, disable, and firewall them!
