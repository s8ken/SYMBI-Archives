ð System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Blocking Changes to ControlCenter.app

Since macOS 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 prevents modifications to system files, 
you cannot change permissions on 
ControlCenter.app
 directly.
 ð«

ð Alternative Ways to Stop Control Center from Opening Ports

Since 
SIP blocks chmod
, weâll 
disable Control Center at the user level
 instead.

ð  Step 1: Disable Control Center via macOS Settings

1ï¸â£ 
Go to System Settings

2ï¸â£ 
Navigate to âControl Centerâ

3ï¸â£ 
Disable all available toggles
 (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AirDrop, etc.)

4ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac

ð 
This prevents Control Center from auto-launching background processes.

ð  Step 2: Block Control Center from Running (Without Disabling SIP)

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

ð 
This prevents it from launching in the background!

ð  Step 3: Check If Control Center Is Still Running

After running the above, check if itâs still active:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

ð 
If it still appears, weâll need to take a stronger approach.

ð Optional: Disable SIP (Advanced)

If you 
absolutely
 want to prevent macOS from running Control Center:

1ï¸â£ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode

Hold 
Command (â) + R
 while restarting

2ï¸â£ Open 
Terminal
 from the menu

3ï¸â£ Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

ð This disables SIP (System Integrity Protection)

4ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac

5ï¸â£ Now, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

6ï¸â£ 
Re-enable SIP for security:

Reboot back into 
Recovery Mode

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Restart normally.

â ï¸ 
WARNING:
 Disabling SIP makes macOS 
more vulnerable
 to system file modifications. Do this 
only if necessary
.

ð Next Steps

1ï¸â£ Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

2ï¸â£ Restart your Mac

3ï¸â£ Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
If Control Center is no longer listening, your Mac is fully locked down!

ð 
Try these steps and let me know if ports 5000 & 7000 are finally closed!
