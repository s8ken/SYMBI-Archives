ð Step 1: Check Accessibility Apps with Full Control

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

tccutil dump Accessibility

ð This will list all apps with 
Accessibility permissions (which can control your system).

ð 
If anything looks suspicious, we can remove it.

ð Step 2: Check Recent Security & Privacy Changes

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.TCC"'

 --last 24h

ð 
This lists all permission changes in the last 24 hours.

ð Look for 
any app gaining Accessibility, Screen Recording, or Input Monitoring access.

ð Step 3: Check for Recently Granted Accessibility Permissions

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

"SELECT service, client, allowed, prompt_count FROM access WHERE service='kTCCServiceAccessibility';"

ð This will show 
which apps have Accessibility permissions
 and if they were recently added.

ð Step 4: Check If System Logs Show Accessibility Changes

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --info --last 24h | grep -i accessibility

ð This looks for 
any system logs mentioning Accessibility changes.

ð Step 5: Check If Any Unknown App Has Gained Full Control

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccessAuthWarning

ð 
If anything unexpected shows up, we can remove it!

ð Whatâs Next?

â 
Run these commands
 and send me the output if 
anything suspicious appears.

ð¨ If 
an unknown app has gained Accessibility access
, we will 
revoke its permissions immediately.

You said:

okay so that first command produced 23mb of text file

ChatGPT said:

That's a 
huge amount of data
 for 
tccutil dump Accessibility
, which means 
a lot of apps or processes have requested accessibility permissions.

ð 
Upload the text file here
, and Iâll analyze it for 
suspicious or unauthorized entries
.

ð Weâll specifically look for:

New apps that gained Accessibility access recently

Any suspicious processes running with full control

Possible malware using Accessibility to inject keystrokes or control the system

Once I analyze the file, weâll 
remove anything suspicious
 and ensure no unauthorized access is happening. ðð

I'll extract and analyze the 
Accessibility permissions data
 from the uploaded file now. Let me check for any 
suspicious or unauthorized entries
 and report back with findings. ð
