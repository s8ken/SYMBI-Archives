 â Input method service (keyboard input).

ð¨ 
Why This Matters?

Input monitoring services
 like 
imklaunchagent
 can be used 
by keyloggers
 or spyware.

If these services requested Accessibility permissions 
recently
, 
we should verify that nothing suspicious is running
.

ð Next Steps: Check & Remove Unauthorized Accessibility Access

1ï¸â£ List All Apps with Accessibility Permissions

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

tccutil dump Accessibility

ð 
This will show a full list of apps that have Accessibility control.

ð Look for 
non-Apple apps
 that shouldnât have full control (e.g., remote access tools, unknown software).

2ï¸â£ Manually Review & Remove Suspicious Accessibility Apps

Open 
System Settings

Go to 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Accessibility

Review all apps that have full control

If you donât recognize an app, REMOVE IT

Click 
"-"
 to revoke its permission.

3ï¸â£ Remove Specific Accessibility Permissions via Terminal

If a 
suspicious app is found
, revoke its access:

sh

Copy

Edit

tccutil reset Accessibility com.[app.bundle.identifier]

ð Replace 
[app.bundle.identifier]
 with the actual app ID from 
tccutil dump Accessibility
.

4ï¸â£ Check If Any Suspicious App Is Running

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i accessibility
ps aux | grep -i tcc

ð If any 
non-Apple process
 is running and has 
Accessibility permissions
, we should investigate further.

ð What To Do Next

â 
Run 
tccutil dump Accessibility
 and manually check for suspicious apps.

â 
Remove any apps from Accessibility settings that you donât recognize.

â

tccutil dump Accessibility
 Didn't Work â Let's Use an Alternative Method

Since 
tccutil dump Accessibility

isn't a valid command
, we need to use 
another way
 to list apps with Accessibility permissions.

ð Step 1: List All Apps with Accessibility Permissions

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

"SELECT service, client FROM access WHERE service='kTCCServiceAccessibility';"

ð 
This will output all apps that have Accessibility access.

ð If you see 
any apps that shouldnât have access
, we will remove them.

ð Step 2: Manually Review Accessibility Permissions

1ï¸â£ 
Open System Settings

2ï¸â£ 
Go to Privacy & Security â Accessibility

3ï¸â£ 
Look at all apps listed

4ï¸â£ 
Remove any apps you donât recognize
 by clicking 
"-"

ð Step 3: Check If Any Suspicious App Is Running

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i accessibility
ps aux | grep -i tcc

ð **If any unknown process appears, let me know, and weâll

ð macOS is Blocking Direct Access to the TCC Database â Letâs Work Around It

Since 
macOS protects the 
TCC.db
 file
, we need 
elevated privileges
 to access it.

ð Step 1: Use 
sudo
 to Read the Accessibility Database

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

"SELECT service, client FROM access WHERE service='kTCCServiceAccessibility';"

ð 
This will list all apps with Accessibility access.

ð If prompted, 
enter your password
 (this is expected since we need root access).
