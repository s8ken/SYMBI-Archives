estarting

Even after previous attempts, 
rapportd
 is still running.

Disable it again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
This prevents 
rapportd
 from running again.

ð Step 4: Verify That These Services Are Now Disabled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"controlcenter|rapportd"

ð 
If they no longer appear, they are fully disabled.
 â

ð Step 5: Block These Ports at the Firewall

Even if 
ControlCe
 or 
rapportd
 tries to restart, we 
block all network traffic to these ports.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

"block drop in proto tcp from any to any port {500

ControlCe
 (Control Center) Cannot Be Disabled via 
launchctl
 â Letâs Use a Stronger Method

Since 

launchctl bootout
 failed
, macOS 
is forcing Control Center to stay active.
 ð¨

We need to take 
stronger measures
 to stop it from launching automatically.

ð Step 1: Kill 
ControlCe
 Again (To Stop It Temporarily)

Since it is still running, force-kill it 
again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 2910

ð 
This will stop Control Center until it tries to restart again.

ð Step 2: Check If Control Center Is Restarting from 
launchd

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep control

ð If it appears, 
we will need to remove its launch configuration manually.

ð Step 3: Manually Remove Control Centerâs Auto-Launch Config

Since 
launchctl bootout

failed
, letâs manually 
delete its startup file.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

ð 
This removes the file that tells macOS to launch Control Center at startup.

ControlCe
 (Control Center) is No Longer Running â Letâs Verify & Prevent It from Restarting
 ð

Since 

kill -9 2910
 returned "No such process,"
 that means 
Control Center is no longer running.
 ð

ð Step 1: Confirm That Control Center is Fully Disabled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

ð 
If nothing appears
, Control Center is 
no longer active.
 â

ð Step 2: Confirm No More Open Ports

Now, check if 
ports 5000, 7000, and 49172 are finally closed
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
If these ports no longer show up, your Mac is fully secured!
 ð¥

ð Step 3: Prevent Control Center from Ever Restarting (Optional)

Since 
Control Center is now gone
, letâs make sure 
macOS canât restart it in the future
:

1ï¸â£ 
Check if the launch agent still exists:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 /System/Library/LaunchAgents | grep control

2ï¸â£ 
If itâs still there, remove it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

ð 
This stops macOS from trying to restart Control Center at login.

ð Step 4: Final Security Check

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep control

ð 
If nothing appears, Control Center is fully removed.
 â

ð¯ Next Steps

â 
If 
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
 no longer shows ports 5000, 7000, or 49172, your Mac is now fully locked down.
 ð

â 
If Control Center no longer appears in 
ps aux | grep ControlCe
, it is fully removed.

ð 
Run the final verification checks and let me know if we can officially call this mission accomplished!
