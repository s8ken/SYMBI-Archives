SIP Protection

SIP (System Integrity Protection) prevents you from deleting or modifying Control Center.

This means even an admin user canât fully remove it without disabling SIP.

If a 
malicious process hijacks Control Center
, 
it could gain persistent system-level access
.

4ï¸â£ Possible Connection to Appleâs Remote Services

Apple uses 
rapportd
 for device syncing and Continuity features.

However, 
rapportd
 is also listening on an open port (49172)
.

If these services are talking to 
external Apple servers
, it might be for diagnostics, updates, or analytics.

If 
you donât use Continuity, Handoff, or Universal Clipboard
, thereâs 
no reason for these services to stay open
.

ð ï¸ How a Hacker Could Exploit This

An attacker 
inside your network
 (or malware already on your system) could:

1ï¸â£ 
Scan your open ports (
5000
, 
7000
, 
49172
)

2ï¸â£ 
Use a local exploit
 to inject code into these system services

3ï¸â£ 
Hijack Control Center to maintain persistence

4ï¸â£ 
Gain access to your system without triggering antivirus alerts

ð 
This is why persistence + open ports = a red flag
 ð¨.

ð Is This a Critical Risk?

ð¢ LOW Risk If
:

â Youâre 
on a trusted network
 (home, private VPN).

â Youâve 
blocked all inbound traffic
 using the macOS firewall (
socketfilterfw
).

â Youâve 
verified no suspicious outgoing connections
 (
lsof -i -P
).

â Youâve 
disabled remote access, screen sharing, SSH, and remote login
.

ð´ HIGH Risk If
:

â Youâre 
on a public or shared network
.

â Youâve 
seen unknown outbound traffic
 in 
Wireshark or LuLu
.

â Youâve noticed 
unusual system behavior (slowness, high CPU, unknown apps running).

â The 
same ports (5000, 7000, 49172) are still open even after firewall blocking.

ð Recommended Actions

If youâre concerned, take these 
extra security steps
:

1ï¸â£ Monitor Network Traffic in Real-Time

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo tcpdump -i any port 5000 or port 7000 or port 49172

ð If 
you see unexpected traffic
, it means something is actively using these ports.

2ï¸â£ Block Outbound Traffic for Control Center & 
rapportd

Even if we 
canât delete them
, we can 
prevent them from talking to the internet.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockApp /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockApp /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This blocks these services from sending or receiving data over the network.

3ï¸â£ Disable SIP, Remove Control Center, and Re-enable SIP

If you 
want full control over your system
, the 
only way to permanently disable Control Center
 is:

1ï¸â£ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command â + R
 on startup).

2ï¸â£ 
Disable SIP:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

3ï¸â£ 
Reboot and delete Control Centerâs files:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

4ï¸â£ 
Re-enable SIP for security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð¨ 
WARNING:

Only disable SIP if you are absolutely sure you want Control Center gone forever.

SIP protects system files from malware, so turning it off can weaken your system security.

ð¯ Conclusion â Should You Be Worried?

ð¹ 
If the ports are still open after all attempts, it is a security risk.

ð¹ 
If you see suspicious network activity (
tcpdump
 shows active connections), it is a security risk.

ð¹ 
If you are on a public network or suspect malware, fully remove Control Center.

ð 
If ports 5000, 7000, and 49172 are still open, letâs take the next step and fully block them.

ð 
What do you want to do next? Try blocking outbound traffic first, or go straight to removing Control Center completely?
