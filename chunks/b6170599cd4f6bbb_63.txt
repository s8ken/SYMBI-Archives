keeping them open
 ð

2ï¸â£ 
Control Center or another process is re-opening them

3ï¸â£ 
macOS itself is forcing these ports to stay active

ð¨ 
We need to find out whatâs REALLY behind these ports and shut it down.

ð Step 1: Identify the Exact Processes Still Using These Ports

Since 
Control Center and 
rapportd
 were blocked
, letâs find out 
what is still using these ports
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :5000
sudo lsof -i :7000
sudo lsof -i :49190

ð 
This will tell us what process is keeping these ports open.

ð 
Post the results here
 so we can determine if this is 
another system process or something suspicious.

ð Step 2: Check If These Ports Are Used by macOS Services

Since 
disabling and blocking services didnât close these ports
, 
we need to check if they are tied to system daemons.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"5000|7000|49190"

ð 
If any system service is tied to these ports, weâll disable it manually.

ð Step 3: Check If These Ports Are Used by Remote Access Tools

Some system processes 
may have been hijacked
 or 
another process is running alongside Control Center
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"remote|control|rapportd"

ð If 
anything unexpected appears,
 we will disable and remove it.

ð Step 4: Temporarily Block These Ports at the Kernel Level

If 
we canât find the cause yet
, we can **manually block the ports

ð Control Center (
ControlCe
) & 
rapportd
 Are STILL Running â Let's Remove Them Completely

Even after blocking them in the firewall, 
Control Center (
ControlCe
) and 
rapportd
 have restarted and are still keeping ports open
 ð¨.

ð 
What's Happening?

1ï¸â£ 
macOS is forcing these services to stay active.

2ï¸â£ 
System processes are auto-relaunching them.

3ï¸â£ 
The only way to fully stop them is to remove or block them at the system level.

ð Step 1: Kill These Processes Again

First, stop them 
before trying to remove them
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 3117
sudo 

kill

 -9 3070

ð 
This will forcefully terminate Control Center & 
rapportd
 again.

ð Step 2: Check If They Are Being Restarted by macOS Services

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"control|rapportd"

ð 
If they appear in the list, macOS is restarting them automatically.

ð 
Post the results here
 so we know 
which service is responsible.

ð Step 3: Manually Disable Their Auto-Restart Services

Since 
launchctl disable

didnât stop them
, we will try again with 
manual service removal
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
If you see an error like "Boot-out failed: Input/output error," we will need to delete them manually.

ð Step 4: Delete Their Auto-Launch Files

If the above command 
fails
, manually delete the launch files:

1ï¸â£ 
Check if the files exist:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 /System/Library/LaunchAgents | grep -E 

"control|rapportd"
