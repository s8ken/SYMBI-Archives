ystem partition writable.

ð Step 2: Delete Control Center & 
rapportd
 Auto-Launch Files

Now, delete the files:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This removes the files so macOS canât restart these services.

ð Step 3: Reboot & Check If Control Center is Finally Gone

Now, reboot your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

Once rebooted, check if 
Control Center & 
rapportd
 are finally gone
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð If 
no output appears
, you have 
successfully removed them!
 ð

ð Step 4: Re-enable SIP for Security

If everything looks good, 
go back to Recovery Mode
 (
â + R
 on boot) and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This turns SIP back on for protection.

ð Safe Mode Still Preventing Deletion? Try Full Recovery Mode

ð¨ 
Safe Mode
 still enforces some 
read-only protections
. To 
fully delete Control Center & 
rapportd

, you need to be in 
macOS Recovery Mode (not Safe Mode).

ð Step 1: Boot into Full Recovery Mode

1ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac

2ï¸â£ 
Immediately hold

Command (â) + R
 until the Apple logo appears

3ï¸â£ 
Once in Recovery Mode
, open 
Terminal
 from the 
Utilities
 menu

ð Step 2: Remount the System as Writable

By default, macOS 
mounts 
/System
 as read-only
, so you need to 
manually remount it as writable
 before you can delete the files.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

ð 
This makes the system partition writable.

ð Step 3: Permanently Delete Control Center & 
rapportd

Now, delete the files:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This removes the files so macOS cannot restart these services.

ð Step 4: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

Restart your Mac normally:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

Once back in normal mode, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
If they do not appear, you have successfully removed them!
 ð

ð Step 5: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once you confirm 
Control Center & 
rapportd
 are gone
, go back to 
Recovery Mode
 (
â + R
 on boot) and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This turns SIP back on to protect your system.

ð¯ Final Steps

â 
Boot into Full Recovery Mode (
â + R
)

â 
Run 
mount -uw /
 to make the system writable

â 
Delete Control Center & 
rapportd
 permanently

â 
Reboot & check if the ports are gone (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
)

â 
Re-enable SIP for security (
csrutil enable
)

ð 
Try these steps and let me know if Control Center & 
rapportd
 are finally removed!
