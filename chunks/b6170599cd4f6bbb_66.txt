ing the launch files, 
Control Center (
ControlCe
) and 
rapportd
 restarted again.

ð 
This means macOS is aggressively protecting these processes and auto-restarting them.

ð¨ 
We now need to take the absolute final step â complete binary removal and system hardening.

ð Step 1: Kill These Processes Again

Before we delete them, 
stop them from running
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 649
sudo 

kill

 -9 635

ð 
This forcefully shuts them down again.

ð Step 2: Prevent Auto-Restart by Disabling Their System Daemons

Since they are 
being auto-restarted
, disable their launch services:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
If this fails, go to Step 3.

ð Step 3: Completely Remove the Binaries

Since 
macOS is rebuilding the launch files
, we need to 
remove the actual executables
.

1ï¸â£ Make the Files Writable

Since SIP sometimes locks files even after disabling it, 
make them writable first
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo chflags nouchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo chflags nouchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This removes system protection flags.

2ï¸â£ Delete the Executables

Now 
permanently remove the apps
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This removes the actual files so they cannot restart.

ð Step 4: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Then, check if they are finally removed:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
If no output appears, you have fully removed them!
 ð

ð Step 5: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
they are gone
, re-enable SIP in Recovery Mode (
â + R
 on boot):

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This locks your system again against unauthorized modifications.

ð¯ Final Steps

â 
Kill Control Center & 
rapportd
 again

â 
Bootout their system services

â 
Remove the actual executable files

â 
Reboot and confirm they are gone (
ps aux
 & 
netstat
)

â 
Re-enable SIP for security

ð 
Try this and let me know if they are FINALLY removed!

You said:

alright I enabled sip before logging back in so can I will complete all of this in recovery and re-enable sip and then come back 

ChatGPT said:

ð Got It! Complete Everything in Recovery Mode & Then Re-enable SIP
 ðð

Yes! Since 
SIP is already re-enabled
, youâll need to 
disable SIP again, remove the files from Recovery Mode, and then re-enable SIP once everything is gone.

ð Full Step-by-Step Recovery Mode Plan

1ï¸â£ 
Boot into Recovery Mode
 (
â + R
 on startup).

2ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal
 from Utilities.

3ï¸â£ 
Disable SIP again:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

4ï¸â£ 
Remount the filesystem as writable:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

5ï¸â£ 
Make the files writable:

sh

Copy

Edit

chflags nouchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
chflags nouchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

6ï¸â£ 
Delete the services completely:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

7ï¸â£ 
Reboot normally and check if they are gone:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
If no output appears, they are fully removed!
 â

8ï¸â£ 
Reboot back into Recovery Mode and re-enable SIP:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð Once Youâre Back

â 
Run 
ps aux | grep ControlCe
 and 
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
 to confirm they are gone.

â 
If the ports are FINALLY closed, your Mac is fully locked d
