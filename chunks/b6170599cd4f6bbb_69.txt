 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
This will remove the executables & launch configurations so they cannot restart.

ð Step 3: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

Once back in normal macOS, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

ð 
If no output appears, you have successfully removed them!
 ð

ð Step 4: Re-enable SIP for Security

If everything is gone, 
go back to Recovery Mode (
â + R
 on boot)
 and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This turns SIP back on to protect your system.

ð¯ Final Steps

â 
Boot into Recovery Mode (
â + R
)

â 
Run 
mount -uw /
 to make the system writable

â 
Delete Control Center & 
rapportd
 permanently

â 
Reboot & check if the ports are gone (
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
)

â 
Re-enable SIP for security (
csrutil enable
)

ð 
Try this and let me know if they are FINALLY removed!

Great work!
 Based on your screenshot, you have:

â 
Disabled SIP
 (
System Integrity Protection is off.
)

â 
Remounted the filesystem as writable
 (
mount -uw /
)

â 
Deleted Control Center (
ControlCentre.app
)

â 
Deleted 
rapportd
 (
/usr/libexec/rapportd
)

â 
Removed their launch agents (
com.apple.controlcenter.plist
, 
com.apple.rapportd.plist
)

ð 
Your Mac should now boot without these services running!

ð ï¸ Next Steps â Confirm That They Are Gone

Now, 
reboot into normal macOS
 and verify that the services are no longer running.

1ï¸â£ 
Restart Your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

2ï¸â£ 
Once booted back into macOS, check if they are gone:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

â 
If no output appears, the services are fully removed!

ð Step 3: Re-enable SIP for Security

Now that the services are gone, 
restore SIP to protect your system:

1ï¸â£ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode (
â + R
 on startup)

2ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

3ï¸â£ 
Reboot back into macOS normally.

ð 
Once youâre back, run the final checks (
ps aux
, 
netstat
) and let me know if everything is locked down! ð¥ð

ð Control Center & 
rapportd
 Came Back â Time for the Final Fix! ð¨

Even after deleting them from 
Recovery Mode
, 
macOS has restored them again.

ð¥ 
This means macOS is reinstalling them automatically at boot.

ð Step 1: Double-Check If They Were Reinstalled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -l /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

ls

 -l /usr/libexec/rapportd

ls

 -l /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

ls

 -l /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
If these files exist again, macOS is forcing them back on every boot.

ð Step 2: Completely Block Execution at the Kernel Level

Since 
deleting the files is not working
, 
we will make them unusable instead.

1ï¸â£ Remove Their Execution Permissions

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This makes them unreadable and unable to execute.

2ï¸â£ Lock the Files to Prevent Restoration

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo chflags uchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/r
