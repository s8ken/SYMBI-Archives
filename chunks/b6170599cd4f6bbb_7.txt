Perfect! â 
Homebrew is installed and working correctly.
 Now, letâs move on to 
installing ClamAV
.

Step 7: Install ClamAV

Run this command to install ClamAV using Homebrew:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install clamav

ð This will download and install ClamAV and all its dependencies.

ð It might take a few minutes, so let it complete.

Once it's done, let me know, and weâll proceed with setting it up! ð

You said:

To finish installation & run clamav you will need to edit
the example conf files at /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/

To start clamav now and restart at startup:
  sudo brew services start clamav
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/clamav/sbin/clamd --foreground

Great! 
ClamAV is installed
 ð. Now, letâs set it up properly step by step.

Step 8: Configure ClamAV

Before we can run ClamAV, we need to 
edit the configuration files
.

1ï¸â£ Copy Default Config Files

Run these commands:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

cp

 /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf.sample /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf
sudo 

cp

 /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/clamd.conf.sample /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/clamd.conf

ð This ensures ClamAV has the necessary config files.

2ï¸â£ Edit 
freshclam.conf
 to Enable Updates

We need to allow 
FreshClam
 to update the virus database.

Open the configuration file in 
nano editor
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf

Use 
â arrow keys
 to navigate.

Find the line that says:

nginx

Copy

Edit

Example

Delete this line
 (it prevents ClamAV from running).

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
 to save and exit.

3ï¸â£ Edit 
clamd.conf
 for Scanning

Similarly, open the 
clamd.conf
 file:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /opt/homebrew/etc/clamav/clamd.conf

Remove the 
Example
 line the same way.

Save and exit (
CTRL + X, Y, Enter
).

Step 9: Update Virus Database

Now, letâs download the latest malware definitions:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo freshclam

ð If this works without errors, ClamAV is 
ready to scan!
 â

ð If you get an error, let me know.

Once done, we can proceed to 
running a scan!
