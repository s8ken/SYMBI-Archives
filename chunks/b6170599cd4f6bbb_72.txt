ð Control Center & 
rapportd
 STILL Restored â Time for the Final Strike! ð¨

ð¥ 
Even after deletion, execution blocking, and file locking, macOS is STILL restoring these services.

ð¨ 
This means the system update process is reinstalling them at boot.

ð´ 
We will now completely remove them from the system cache and prevent restoration at a deeper level.

ð Step 1: Unload & Disable the Services BEFORE Deleting

Before trying to delete them again, we 
must first unload them from macOS memory
 so they donât restart instantly.

1ï¸â£ 
Stop the services from running:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo killall ControlCenter
sudo killall rapportd

ð 
This will fully stop them before deletion.

ð Step 2: Remove the System Cache That Restores Them

Even if we delete them, macOS 
restores files from a system cache stored in 
/System/Library/Caches/

.

We must 
wipe this cache
 before deleting the services again.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.controlcenter*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*

ð 
This clears the system cache that restores deleted files.

ð Step 3: Fully Delete Control Center & 
rapportd
 Again

Now, delete them again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
They are now gone permanently.

ð Step 4: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy
