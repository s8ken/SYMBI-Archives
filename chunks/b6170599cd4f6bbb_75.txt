ð 
rapportd
 is STILL Resisting â Time for the FINAL Method ð¨

ð¥ 
The fact that 
bootout
 gives an I/O error means macOS is treating 
rapportd
 as a deeply protected system process.

ð 
We are now going to use the 
ultimate
 method to fully disable it at the kernel level.

ð Step 1: Move 
rapportd
 to a Fake Location to Break It

Since macOS 
restores 
rapportd

, 
we will move it to a fake directory so it canât run
.

1ï¸â£ 
Move it instead of deleting it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

ð 
This tricks macOS into thinking it is missing but prevents it from being restored.

2ï¸â£ 
Create a fake empty file in its place:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This creates a "ghost" version that macOS cannot execute or replace.

ð Step 2: Stop 
rapportd
 From Running Right Now

After moving it, 
force it to stop completely
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd

ð 
Now, it cannot restart since the real file is gone.

ð Step 3: Remove Launch Daemons That Restore It

Even if 
rapportd
 is removed, 
macOS may still be launching it.

Remove its startup files:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
This stops it from launching at boot.

ð Step 4: Reboot & Confirm Removal

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Once rebooted, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
sudo launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð 
If nothing appears, 
rapportd
 is finally removed! ð

ð Step 5: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that it is gone
, 
restore SIP
 to protect your system:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
Done!
 ð 
Try this and let me know if 
rapportd
 is finally dead.

I think I need to do it in recovery again

ChatGPT said:

â Yes! Recovery Mode is Needed for the FINAL Removal ð

ð¥ 
Since macOS is treating 
rapportd
 as a core system process, you MUST perform these steps in 
Recovery Mode
.

ð 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) will continue restoring it unless removed in Recovery Mode.

ð Step 1: Boot Into Recovery Mode

1ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac and hold 
Command (â) + R
 immediately

2ï¸â£ 
Select "Disk Utility"
 â Click 
"Mount"
 on your macOS disk

3ï¸â£ 
Quit Disk Utility

4ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal from the Utilities menu

ð Step 2: Make the File System Writable

Since 
macOS locks system files by default
, 
make them writable
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

mount -uw /

ð 
This allows you to delete system-protected files.

ð Step 3: MOVE 
rapportd
 to a Fake Location

Instead of deleting it (which macOS may restore), 
move it
 to break its functionality:

sh

Copy

Edit

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

ð 
This prevents macOS from finding the executable.

Now, 
replace it with a fake, non-executable file
:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This makes it permanently unusable.

ð Step 4: Remove the Launch Daemons That Restore 
rapportd

Delete any auto-restart files for 
rapportd
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
This ensures 
rapportd
 does not launch again.

ð Step 5: Reboot & Confirm Removal

Now, 
restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
sudo launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is FINALLY GONE! ð

ð Step 6: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that it is gone
, 
restore SIP to protect your system:

sh

Copy

Edit
