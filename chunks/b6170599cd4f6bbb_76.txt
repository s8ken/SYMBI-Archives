just rapportd or the other thing as well?

ð¥ REMOVE BOTH 
rapportd
 AND CONTROL CENTER FOR COMPLETE SECURITY
 ð

Since 
macOS keeps restoring both 
rapportd
 and Control Center
, you 
should remove both at the same time
 in 
Recovery Mode
 to fully stop them.

ð 
Hereâs the full process to remove BOTH 
rapportd
 and Control Center permanently.

ð Step 1: Boot Into Recovery Mode

1ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac and hold 
Command (â) + R
 immediately

2ï¸â£ 
Select "Disk Utility"
 â Click 
"Mount"
 on your macOS disk

3ï¸â£ 
Quit Disk Utility

4ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal from the Utilities menu

ð Step 2: Make the File System Writable

Since 
macOS locks system files by default
, 
make them writable
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

mount -uw /

ð 
This allows you to delete system-protected files.

ð Step 3: MOVE 
rapportd
 and Control Center to a Fake Location

Instead of deleting them (which macOS may restore), 
move them
 to break their functionality:

sh

Copy

Edit

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

mv

 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.bak

ð 
Now, macOS canât find the real executables.

Now, 
replace them with fake, non-executable files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

touch

 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
chflags uchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

ð 
This makes them permanently unusable and blocks macOS from restoring them.

ð Step 4: Remove the Launch Daemons That Restore Them

Delete any auto-restart files:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

ð 
This ensures macOS does not restart them at boot.

ð Step 5: Clear the System Cache That Keeps Restoring Them

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.controlcenter*

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*

ð 
Now, macOS has no cached versions of these processes.

ð Step 6: Reboot & Confirm Removal

Now, 
restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

ð 
If no output appears, they are FINALLY gone! ð

ð Step 7: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that they are gone
, 
restore SIP to protect your system
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
Done!
 ð 
Try this in Recovery Mode and let me know if both 
rapportd
 and Control Center are FINALLY removed. ð¥ð

When in tried moving it said no such file or
Directory

ð If 
mv
 Fails with "No Such File or Directory," Hereâs What to Do ð¨

ð¥ 
This means 
rapportd
 and/or Control Center may have been removed already OR their paths are slightly different.

ð 
We need to verify their exact locations before proceeding.

ð Step 1: Check If 
rapportd
 and Control Center Are Still Present

Run the following commands to check their locations:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /usr/libexec/ | grep rapportd

ls

 -la /System/Library/CoreServices/ | grep ControlCenter

ð 
If nothing appears, 
rapportd
 and Control Center are already gone! ð

ð 
If they still exist, continue to Step 2.

ð Step 2: Try Moving Them Again With the Correct Path

If 
ls
 confirms they still exist but 
mv
 fails, try this alternative move command:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rappo
