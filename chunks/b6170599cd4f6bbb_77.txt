rtd.bak
sudo 

mv

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

"/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.bak"

ð 
Notice the space in "Control Center.app" â some macOS versions use a space!

ð Step 3: If Moving Still Fails, Force Remove Instead

If moving 
still does not work
, you must 
force delete instead
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

rm

 -rf 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

ð 
This permanently removes them instead of moving them.

ð Step 4: Prevent macOS From Restoring Them

Even if 
rapportd
 and Control Center are deleted, 
macOS might restore them
.

To block this, 
create a fake, unremovable version of them
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

sudo 

touch

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

sudo 

chmod

 000 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

sudo chflags uchg 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

ð 
This prevents macOS from reinstalling them.

ð Step 5: Remove System Daemons That Restart Them

If 
rapportd
 or Control Center keeps returning, 
remove their startup files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

ð 
This stops macOS from running them at startup.

ð Step 6: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Then check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

ð 
If no output appears, they are FINALLY removed! ð

ð Step 7: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that they are gone
, 
restore SIP
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
Done!
 ð 
Try these steps and let me know if they are FINALLY gone. ð¥ð

ð Recovery Mode: 
rapportd
 is Already Gone or in a Different Location

ð¥ 
The "No such file or directory" error means that 
rapportd
 is either already removed or is located somewhere else.

ð¨ 
Also, 
sudo
 is not available in macOS Recovery Mode, so you donât need it!

ð Step 1: Confirm Whether 
rapportd
 is Still Present

Since 
mv
 failed, 
letâs check if the file exists at all
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /usr/libexec/ | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is already gone! ð

ð 
If it still appears, continue to Step 2.

ð Step 2: If 
rapportd
 is in a Different Location, Find It

Try searching for 
rapportd
 manually:

sh

Copy

Edit

find / -name rapportd 2>/dev/null

ð 
This will locate the file anywhere on your system.

ð 
If it finds a different path, use that path for the next steps.

ð Step 3: If 
rapportd
 Exists, Try Moving It Again

If 
ls
 or 
find
 shows the file still exists, 
try moving it again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

ð 
If this still fails, go to Step 4.

ð Step 4: If Moving Still Fails, Delete It Instead

If 
mv
 still doesnât work, 
force delete it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
Now, 
rapportd
 is permanently gone.

ð Step 5: Create a Fake 
rapportd
 So macOS Canât Restore It

Even if you remove 
rapportd
, 
macOS might try to restore it.

To block this:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This makes 
rapportd
 permanently unusable.

ð Step 6: Remove Any Launch Daemons That Restart It

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
remove its startup files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
