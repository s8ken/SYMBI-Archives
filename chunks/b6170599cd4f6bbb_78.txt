ð Recovery Mode Issues: 
rapportd
 Not Found & 
sudo
 Command Missing

ð¨ 
Key Takeaways from Your Image:

1ï¸â£ 

rapportd
 is either already removed or in a different location.

2ï¸â£ 

sudo
 is NOT available in macOS Recovery Mode.

3ï¸â£ 

mount -uw /
 worked, so you should have write access.

ð Step 1: Check If 
rapportd
 Exists Anywhere on Your System

Since 
mv
 failed with "No such file or directory," let's check whether 
rapportd
 is still there.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /usr/libexec/ | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is already gone! ð

ð 
If it still appears, note the exact filename and move to Step 2.

ð Step 2: If 
rapportd
 Exists in Another Location, Find It

If 
ls
 did not show anything, use this command to locate it:

sh

Copy

Edit

find / -name 

"rapportd"

 2>/dev/null

ð 
This will search your entire system for 
rapportd
.

ð 
If it returns a different path, use that path in Step 3.

ð Step 3: If 
rapportd
 Exists, Move or Delete It

If 
find
 or 
ls
 confirms 
rapportd
 still exists, try 
moving it again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

ð 
If this still fails, go to Step 4.

ð Step 4: If Moving Still Fails, Force Delete It

If 
mv
 doesnât work, 
force delete 
rapportd

:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This permanently removes it.

ð Step 5: Create a Fake 
rapportd
 to Block macOS from Restoring It

Even after removing 
rapportd
, macOS may try to 
restore it from its cache
.

To 
block this
:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This makes 
rapportd
 permanently unusable.

ð Step 6: Remove Any Launch Daemons That Restart 
rapportd

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
remove its startup files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
This ensures macOS does not relaunch it at boot.

ð Step 7: Restart & Confirm 
rapportd
 Is Gone

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

Once rebooted, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is finally gone! ð

ð Step 8: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is confirmed gone, 
restore SIP to protect your system
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
Done!
 ð 
Try these steps and let me know if 
rapportd
 is FINALLY removed. ð¥ð

â Next Steps: Find and Remove 
rapportd

Since 
rapportd
 is not at 
/usr/libexec/rapportd
, we need to 
locate it first
.

ð Step 1: Check If 
rapportd
 Exists at All

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /usr/libexec/ | grep rapportd

ð 
If nothing appears, 
rapportd
 is already removed.
 ð

ð 
If it appears, continue to Step 2.

ð Step 2: Search for 
rapportd
 Anywhere in the System

If 
ls
 does not find it, try searching the entire system:

sh

Copy

Edit

find / -name 

"rapportd"
