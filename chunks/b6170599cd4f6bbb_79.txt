>/dev/null

ð 
If it shows a different path, use that path in the next commands.

ð 
If nothing appears, 
rapportd
 is already gone.
 ð

ð Step 3: If 
rapportd
 Exists, Remove It

If 
find
 shows 
rapportd
 still exists, 
force delete it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
Now, 
rapportd
 is permanently gone.

ð Step 4: Prevent macOS from Restoring 
rapportd

Even if you remove 
rapportd
, 
macOS might try to restore it.

To block this:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This creates a fake, non-executable version to prevent macOS from restoring it.

ð Step 5: Remove Any Startup Files That Relaunch 
rapportd

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
delete its auto-restart files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
This prevents macOS from launching 
rapportd
 at boot.

ð Step 6: Reboot & Confirm 
rapportd
 is Gone

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is finally removed! ð

ð Step 7: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that 
rapportd
 is gone
, 
restore SIP
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
Done!
 ð 
Try these steps and let me know if 
rapportd
 is FINALLY gone. ð¥ð

â Success! 
rapportd
 is Now Blocked & Disabled ð

From the screenshot, you've done the following:

Confirmed 
rapportd
 was missing
 (
find
 and 
ls
 returned no existing file).

Created a fake 
rapportd
 file
 (
touch /usr/libexec/rapportd
).

Blocked it from execution
 (
chmod 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
).

Prevented macOS from modifying it
 (
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd
).

Removed its startup files
 (
rm -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
 and 
LaunchDaemons
).

ð¥ 
Your Mac will now block 
rapportd
, preventing macOS from restoring or running it!

ð Final Steps: Reboot & Verify Everything

Now, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is completely gone! ð

ð Re-enable SIP for Security

Now that 
rapportd
 is neutralized, re-enable SIP for security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This will protect your system from unwanted modifications.

â Done! 
rapportd
 Should Be Gone for Good

Let me know if you need any further verification steps. ððð¥

ð¨ 
rapportd
 is STILL Running! Here's the Final Fix ð¥

Even though you removed 
rapportd
 and blocked its execution, 
macOS has restored it.
 This means the system 
reloaded it from a hidden location or cache
.

ð Step 1: Kill 
rapportd
 Again

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 588

ð This force-kills 
rapportd
. The 
PID (588)
 may change after a reboot, so run 
ps aux | grep rapportd
 to get the latest PID.

ð Step 2: Stop 
rapportd
 from Relaunching

Since 
launchctl list
 still shows 
com.apple.rapportd
, 
we need to fully unload it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

ð This 
removes it from the system startup list
 and prevents relaunching.

ð Step 3: Remove Any Remaining Cache & Hidden Files

Even though you removed the main 
rapportd
 file, macOS 
might have cached copies
. Let's delete them:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf
