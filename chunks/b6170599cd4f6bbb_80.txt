/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/run/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*

ð 
This forces macOS to stop auto-restoring 
rapportd
.

ð Step 4: Create a Fake 
rapportd
 & Block Modifications

Now, recreate 
rapportd
 as a fake file so macOS 
cannot restore it again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This makes 
rapportd
 permanently locked.

ð 
Even if macOS tries to restore it, it will fail.

ð Step 5: Restart & Verify

Now, reboot your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After restarting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is GONE! ð

ð Step 6: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed that 
rapportd
 is removed, 
restore System Integrity Protection (SIP)
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This locks the system against unauthorized modifications.

â Youâre Done! 
rapportd
 Should Be Fully Neutralized Now.
 ðð

Try these steps and let me know if 
rapportd
 is FINALLY gone! ð¥

You said:

lets come back to this one - is there any other way to block these things either at the router or firewall level

ChatGPT said:

ð¡ï¸ Blocking 
rapportd
 and Other Unwanted Services at the Router/Firewall Level ð¥

If 
rapportd
 keeps respawning, 
blocking it at the network level
 is another powerful way to stop it. ð

ð¥ Option 1: Block 
rapportd
 Using the Mac Firewall

Since 
rapportd
 connects to Apple's servers, you can 
block it using the built-in macOS firewall
.

Step 1: Enable the Firewall & Stealth Mode

First, make sure macOS's firewall is turned on:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on

ð 
This blocks incoming requests and makes your Mac "invisible" to network scans.

Step 2: Block 
rapportd
's Internet Access

Now, explicitly block 
rapportd
 from making network requests:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This stops 
rapportd
 from connecting to Apple's servers.

Step 3: Verify That 
rapportd
 is Blocked

Check the firewall settings:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --listapps

ð If 
rapportd
 is listed as 
blocked
, youâre good! ð

ð¥ Option 2: Block 
rapportd
 at the Router (Best Method)

If 
rapportd
 is connecting to Apple's servers, you can 
block its network traffic at the router
.

Step 1: Find Out Where 
rapportd
 is Connecting

To see what servers 
rapportd
 is talking to, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

Youâll see output like:

nginx

Copy

Edit

rapportd

588

 sja  10u  IPv4 0x5b5a0e32dcadbb46  0t0  TCP 

192.168.1.100:52134

 -> 

17.57.145.44:443

 (ESTABLISHED)

ð The 
last part (
17.57.145.44:443
) is the Apple server IP.

Step 2: Block These IPs in Your Router

Now, log in to your 
router admin panel
 and:

Find the 
Firewall Settings
 or 
Access Control
 section.

Add a new 
rule to block the IPs
 found in Step 1.

Set 
"Block All Connections"
 for those IPs.

ð 
This will stop 
rapportd
 from reaching Appleâs servers at all!
 ð

ð¥ Option 3: Block 
rapportd
 Using Little Snitch or Lulu (Easiest)

If you want 
a GUI method
, use 
Little Snitch
 (paid) or 
Lulu
 (free) to block network connections.

How to Block 
rapportd
 in Lulu:

Open 
Lulu
 (
/Applications/Lulu.app
).

Click 
Rules
 â 
New Rule
.

Select:

Process:

/usr/libexec/rapportd

Action:

Block

Direction:

Outgoing

Apply the rule.

ð 
Now, 
rapportd
 canât send or receive any data!
