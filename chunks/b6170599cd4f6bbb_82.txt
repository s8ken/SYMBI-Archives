ð 
This ensures macOS cannot restore 
rapportd
.

ð Step 4: Make a Fake 
rapportd
 & Block Modifications

Even after deleting 
rapportd
, macOS 
might try to restore it
.

Letâs 
create a fake version
 that 
CANNOT be replaced
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
Now, 
rapportd
 is permanently blocked, even if macOS tries to restore it!

ð Step 5: Restart & Verify

Now, 
reboot your Mac
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Then, check again:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is 100% dead!
 ð

ð¥ Step 6: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is confirmed 
fully disabled
, 
turn System Integrity Protection (SIP) back on
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This ensures no unauthorized modifications can be made to your system.

â DONE! 
rapportd
 Should Be Fully Neutralized ð¥

Try these steps and let me know 
if 
rapportd
 is finally gone for good!

what about lulu

ChatGPT said:

ð¡ï¸ Using Lulu to Block 
rapportd
 (or Any Process) ð¥

Lulu is a great 
network firewall for macOS
 that can 
block outgoing connections
 for specific apps or system processes. If 
rapportd
 is still trying to connect to the internet, Lulu can 
shut it down completely
. ð

ð¥ Step 1: Open Lulu and Add a Block Rule for 
rapportd

Open 
Lulu
 (
/Applications/Lulu.app
).

Click 
Rules
 â 
New Rule
.

Select:

Process:

/usr/libexec/rapportd

Action:

Block

Direction:

Outgoing

Click 
Save
.

ð 
This will stop 
rapportd
 from making any network requests!

ð¥ Step 2: Verify if 
rapportd
 is Still Making Connections

After blocking it in Lulu, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð If 
no network activity appears
, 
rapportd
 is successfully blocked! ð

ð¥ Step 3: Enable Stealth Mode in Lulu

To 
prevent 
rapportd
 from bypassing
 the firewall:

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Preferences
.

Enable 
Stealth Mode
 (Blocks all unknown outgoing connections).

Apply changes.

ð This ensures 
ANY unknown process (including 
rapportd
) is denied internet access
.

ð¥ Step 4: Monitor 
rapportd
 for Any Activity

Since 
rapportd
 tries to auto-reconnect, 
you can monitor if itâs still trying to connect:

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Network Events
.

Look for any blocked 
rapportd
 connections.

If you see 
attempted traffic
, Lulu is successfully blocking it!

ð 
If 
rapportd
 keeps trying to reconnect, itâs proof macOS is trying to force it back online!
 ð¨

ð¥ Step 5: Combine Lulu with Other Firewall Rules

Even though Lulu blocks outgoing traffic, macOS 
might still restart 
rapportd

.

ð 
For MAXIMUM security, combine Lulu with:

Blocking 
rapportd
 at the macOS firewall

Disabling it via 
launchctl

Deleting any cached system files

ð 
This makes sure 
rapportd
 is neutralized at ALL levels: system, network, and process execution.

â Conclusion: Lulu is an Extra Lock ð

ð 
Lulu blocks 
rapportd
 from sending data.

ð¥ 
But macOS might still restart it in the background.

ð¡ï¸ 
Use Lulu + system-level disabling for complete control!

ð 
Let me know if 
rapportd
 is still sneaky after this!

You said:

do I put anything for remote port?

ChatGPT said:

No, you 
donât
 need to specify a remote port when creating a block rule for 
rapportd
 in 
Lulu
. ð

â How to Set Up the Lulu Block Rule

When adding the 
block rule
, focus on these settings:

Process:

/usr/libexec/rapportd

Action:

Block

Direction:

Outgoing

Remote Address:

(Leave blank to block all connections)

Remote Port:

(Leave blank to block all ports)

Protocol:

(Leave as "Any")
