 leave Remote Port blank?

Leaving it blank 
blocks ALL outgoing connections
 instead of just specific ports.

This means 
rapportd

cannot communicate over any port
âeven if it tries different ones. ð

ð¥ Want to See What Ports 
rapportd
 Uses?

Before blocking, you can 
check what ports 
rapportd
 is trying to connect to
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

This will show lines like:

markdown

Copy

Edit

rapportd  588   sja    8u  IPv4 0x...      0t0  TCP 
*:49152 (LISTEN)
rapportd  588   sja    9u  IPv6 0x...      0t0  TCP *
:443 (ESTABLISHED)

ð The 
remote ports
 (
443
, 
49152
, etc.) are the ones 
rapportd
 is using.

â Best Practice: Block Everything

If you 
leave "Remote Port" blank
, Lulu 
blocks 
rapportd
 from all network traffic
, no matter what port it tries. 
This is the best option.

Let me know if you see 
rapportd
 still trying to sneak past Lulu!

Awesome! 
rapportd
 is now BLOCKED at the firewall level!
 ð¥

Now, letâs 
verify that itâs completely cut off from the network
 and 
make sure it doesnât restart itself.
 ð

â Step 1: Confirm 
rapportd
 is Fully Blocked

Run this command to check if itâs still making network connections:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð 
Expected result:

No output
 (which means itâs NOT talking to any remote server).

ð If it 
still shows connections
, Lulu is blocking them, but the process is still trying.

â Step 2: Stop & Prevent 
rapportd
 from Running

Letâs 
kill 
rapportd
 manually
 to see if it tries to restart:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd

Then, check if it restarted:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð If 
no output appears
, itâs 
gone!
 ð

â Step 3: Add Extra Protection (Optional)

If 
rapportd
 keeps coming back, 
take these extra steps
:

ð 
Disable 
rapportd
 Completely

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

ð 
Make a Fake 
rapportd
 File

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This blocks macOS from restoring it!

â Final Check: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After rebooting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð **If 
rapportd
 is gone and Lulu shows

ð¨ 
rapportd
 is STILL Running & Listening! Letâs Shut It Down for Good ð¥

Even though 
Lulu is blocking

rapportd
 from making 
outgoing
 connections, itâs 
still running
 and 
listening on port 49164
. Letâs 
fully disable and remove it
 so it canât restart. ð

ð Step 1: Kill 
rapportd
 Again

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 1028

ð 
This force-kills 
rapportd
 immediately.

ð Step 2: Stop It from Restarting

Disable 
rapportd
 at the system level:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

ð 
Now, macOS will NOT restart 
rapportd
.

ð Step 3: Delete 
rapportd
 from System Locations

Since macOS 
restores system files
, delete all traces:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /private/var/run/com.apple.rapportd*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*

ð 
Now, no cache files can restore it.

ð Step 4: Make a Fake 
rapportd
 File

This 
prevents macOS from re-creating 
rapportd

:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
Now, even if macOS tries to restore 
rapportd
, it CANâT!
 ð

ð Step 5: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After reboot, 
check if
