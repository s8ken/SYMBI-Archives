rapportd
 is gone
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð 
If thereâs NO output, 
rapportd
 is FINALLY DEAD!
 ð

ð¥ Final Step: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once you confirm 
rapportd
 is gone, 
turn System Integrity Protection (SIP) back on
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This stops macOS from modifying system files again.

â 
rapportd
 Should Now Be Completely Neutralized! ð¥

If 
rapportd

still comes back
, let me know and weâll go 
even deeper

no no I'm not doing all that again lol not at least right now - its too many reboots and sip on and off and all that - so what happens if we try and utilise it with the Lulu rule on?

Fair enough! No more reboots for now!
 Let's see what happens if we 
let 
rapportd
 run
 while Lulu 
keeps it on a leash.
 ðð

ð¥ Testing 
rapportd
 with Lulu Blocking It

Since Lulu is 
actively blocking all outbound connections
, 
rapportd

should be running but completely useless.
 Letâs test:

â Step 1: Check if 
rapportd
 is Trying to Connect

Run this command to see if 
rapportd
 is 
still attempting network activity
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð 
Expected result:

No established outbound connections.

ð If you see 
(LISTEN)
, it means it's running but canât connect anywhere.

â Step 2: Check Lulu's Network Events

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Network Events
.

Look for any 
blocked attempts by 
rapportd

.

ð 
If 
rapportd
 is repeatedly trying and getting blocked, it means itâs completely useless.
 ð

â Step 3: Manually Trigger 
rapportd

Letâs see how it reacts if we 
manually activate it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl start com.apple.rapportd

Then immediately check Lulu logs & active connections:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð If 
Lulu blocks all traffic
, 
rapportd
 is 
neutered
 but still 
alive
 in the system.

ð¤ What Happens Next?

If 
rapportd

stays quiet and does nothing
 â 
Lulu is doing its job.

If it 
keeps trying to connect but fails
 â 
Itâs running in the background but is 100% ineffective.

If it 
finds a way to connect
 â Weâll need 
extra layers of blocking.
 ð¥

ð 
Give it a try & let me know what you find!

Interesting! 
rapportd
 is still LISTENING, but itâs not making OUTBOUND connections.
 ð

This means 
Lulu is doing its job
, but 
rapportd
 is still 
active
 in the background. Letâs dig deeper.

ð¡ï¸ Step 1: Check If Itâs Trying to Connect Out

Since 
rapportd
 is in a 
LISTEN
 state, itâs waiting for something. Letâs check if itâs actually making outbound requests:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | grep rapportd

ð 
Expected:

No output
 (because Lulu is blocking it).

ð 
If there is output
, it found a way past Lulu, and we need to go harder. ð¥

ð¡ï¸ Step 2: Watch Luluâs Logs for Activity

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Network Events
.

Look for 
rapportd
 entries 
(they should be blocked)
.

If 
Lulu shows 
rapportd
 trying and failing
, 
itâs still attempting to connect
, but itâs failing.

ð 
If Lulu is catching & blocking it, itâs effectively useless.

ð 
If there are no logs, 
rapportd
 isnât even trying to connect anymore.
 ð

ð¡ï¸ Step 3: Force 
rapportd
 to Try & Connect

Letâs provoke 
rapportd
 and see how it reacts:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.rapportd

Then immediately check:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd
sudo netstat -an | grep rapportd

ð 
If it stays in LISTEN mode with no outb
