in

Now that 
Handoff is turned off
, letâs manually 
kill 
rapportd

 and see if it stays gone.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd

ð 
This should stop 
rapportd
 immediately.

â Step 2: Does It Restart?

Now check if 

rapportd
 comes back:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd

ð 
If 
rapportd
 is GONE
, then Handoff was the cause. ð

ð 
If 
rapportd
 RESTARTS, something else is triggering it.

â Step 3: Check if Itâs Still Trying to Connect

Even if 
rapportd
 is running, it might still be 
blocked from doing anything
. Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears
, 
rapportd
 is running but canât talk to the internet. ð

ð Final Thoughts

If 
rapportd
 disappears after killing it
, 
Handoff was the reason it kept running
 â

If it restarts automatically, thereâs another macOS process triggering it.
 ð¥

If Lulu is blocking its network traffic, itâs alive but totally useless.

ð 
rapportd
 is Restarting Automatically â Something Else is Keeping It Alive! ð¨

ð 
Key findings from your test:

1ï¸â£ 
You killed 
rapportd
, but it restarted instantly.

2ï¸â£ 
Itâs still in 
LISTEN
 mode on port 
49168
 (waiting for connections).

3ï¸â£ 
Even with Handoff disabled, something else is forcing it to run.

ð¥ Step 1: Find What is Restarting 
rapportd

Letâs check 
which macOS process is launching 
rapportd

:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep rapportd

ð 
If a service like 
com.apple.rapportd
 appears, thatâs what is forcing it to restart.

ð¥ Step 2: Force-Stop 
rapportd
 from Auto-Restarting

If 
launchctl list
 shows 
com.apple.rapportd
, 
disable it manually
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.rapportd

ð 
This should stop macOS from respawning it.

ð¥ Step 3: Confirm 
rapportd
 is Gone

Now, 
kill it again
 and check if it comes back:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall rapportd
ps aux | grep rapportd

ð 
If it stays dead, the bootout command worked!
 ð

ð 
If it respawns, move to Step 4.

ð¥ Step 4: Block 
rapportd
 at the System Firewall

Even though 
Lulu is blocking network traffic
, macOS might still use internal processes. 
Letâs double-layer it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This blocks ALL connections, even local system ones.

ð¥ Step 5: Check Whatâs Keeping 
rapportd
 Alive

If it still keeps coming back, 
trace what is forcing it to restart
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo fs_usage | grep rapportd

ð 
This will show whatâs calling 
rapportd
 to relaunch.

ð 
If a system process is triggering it, weâll disable that too!
 ð¥

ð Next Steps

ð 
Find what is restarting 
rapportd

 (
launchctl list | grep rapportd
).

â 
Disable auto-restart
 (
launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
).

ð 
Kill it again and verify it stays dead.

ð 
Double-block it at the firewall if necessary.

ð 
Run these tests and let me know whatâs forcing 
rapportd
 to stay alive!
