ith a dummy file.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

ð 
This creates a "ghost" version that macOS cannot replace or execute.

ð Step 4: Remove Any Hidden Startup Triggers

Even if 
rapportd
 is removed, 
macOS might still be trying to launch it.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

ð 
This stops macOS from launching 
rapportd
 at boot.

ð Step 5: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Then check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep rapportd
launchctl list | grep rapportd
sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

ð 
If no output appears, 
rapportd
 is finally dead!
 ð

ð Step 6: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that 
rapportd
 is gone
, 
restore SIP to protect your system:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

ð 
This will stop macOS from modifying system files again.

ð¥ FINAL VERDICT: This Should END 
rapportd
 for Good

â 
No auto-restart

â 
No network connections

â 
No process running

â 
SIP re-enabled for protection

ð 
Try this and let me know if 
rapportd
 is finally DEAD for real! ð¥

ð¤ Is 
rapportd
 Harmless or a Security Risk? Let's Break It Down

Since 
Lulu is blocking 
rapportd
 from making outbound connections
 and 
youâve verified that itâs not establishing external connections
, itâs currently 
not a direct security risk
. However, its presence 
could still be concerning
 depending on your needs.

â What 
rapportd
 Actually Does

rapportd
 is part of Apple's 
Continuity & Handoff
 features. Itâs mainly responsible for:

ð¹ 
Handoff
 between macOS and iOS devices.

ð¹ 
Universal Clipboard
 (copy on Mac, paste on iPhone).

ð¹ 
Auto-Unlock with Apple Watch.

ð¹ 
AirDrop discovery & Bluetooth proximity sensing.

ð¹ 
Encrypted communication with Apple services.

ð 
If youâre using ANY of these features, 
rapportd
 is required for them to work.

ð 
If you donât use Handoff, Universal Clipboard, or AirDrop, 
rapportd
 serves no real purpose.

ð¡ï¸ Is 
rapportd
 a Security Risk?

ð Reasons Why Itâs Probably Harmless

â 
Itâs an Apple system process, NOT third-party malware.

â 
It doesnât send data unless triggered by a feature (e.g., Handoff).

â 
Lulu is blocking ALL network traffic, making it powerless.

ð¨ Reasons Why It Might Be a Concern

â ï¸ 
It runs persistently in the background, even if disabled.

â ï¸ 
It listens on local network ports, which 
could
 be exploited.

â ï¸ 
Apple has not provided full transparency on what data it collects.

ð Final Verdict:

If you trust Apple & use macOS features like Handoff â 
rapportd
 is fine to leave as-is.

no no you said it was like a zombie before

ChatGPT said:

ð§ââï¸ 
rapportd
: A Harmless Zombie or a Security Risk?

ð 
Right now, 
rapportd
 is basically a "zombie"âitâs running, but itâs not actually doing anything.

ð 
Lulu is blocking its network activity, meaning it canât communicate with Appleâs servers or anything else.

ð§ What This Means:

â 
Itâs not transmitting data
 â Lulu is stopping all outbound connections.

â 
Itâs not making external requests
 â 
netstat
 showed no 
ESTABLISHED
 connections.

â 
Itâs not actively harming your system
 â Itâs just sitting in the background, waiting for features (like Handoff) to be used.

ð So, Is It Dangerous?

No, 
rapportd
 is NOT a security risk
 in its current state, because:

ð 
Itâs completely blocked from sending or receiving data.

ð 
Itâs in LISTEN mode but not connecting to anything.

ð¤ 
Itâs just an idle system process with no control over your Mac.

ð Why I Called It a "Zombie"

Itâs like a
