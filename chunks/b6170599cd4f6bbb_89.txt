ie
âitâs 
still running
, but it 
canât bite anyone
 because itâs 
locked in a box
 (thanks to Lulu and your firewall).

ð What Should You Do Next?

1ï¸â£ 
If You Want to Keep It Running (Safe & Contained)

Leave Lulu blocking it
 â It wonât do anything harmful.

It wonât affect your Mac unless you use Handoff/AirDrop.

2ï¸â£ 
If You Want to Remove It Completely (Extra Security)

You can follow the 
nuclear steps
 later (when youâre ready for more SIP toggling).

ð¥ Final Verdict

â 
Right now, 
rapportd
 is completely harmless.

â 
Itâs running, but canât send or receive data.

â 
Lulu is keeping it locked down.

ð 
So yes, itâs a zombieâbut a zombie in a cage, not one trying to eat your brains.

lol ok so control centre - can we do the same?

ChatGPT said:

ð 
Yes! Letâs Cage That Control Center Zombie Too! ð§ââï¸ð

Since we 
successfully neutered 
rapportd

, we can 
do the exact same thing to Control Center
 so it 
runs but is completely useless.
 ð

ð¡ï¸ Step 1: Block Control Centerâs Network Access (Lulu)

Just like 
rapportd
, Control Center 
shouldnât need network access
, but 
Apple sneaks in background requests
 sometimes.

1ï¸â£ Open 
Lulu
 (
/Applications/Lulu.app
).

2ï¸â£ Go to 
Rules
 â 
New Rule
.

3ï¸â£ Select:

Process:

/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

Action:

Block

Direction:

Outgoing

4ï¸â£ Click 
Save
.

ð 
Now Control Center canât call home to Appleâs servers!

ð¡ï¸ Step 2: Check If Control Center Is Making Network Requests

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ControlCenter

ð 
If no output appears, itâs not talking to the internet.
 â

ð 
If it shows LISTEN or ESTABLISHED, Lulu will block it anyway.
 ð¥

ð¡ï¸ Step 3: Disable Auto-Startup (If Needed)

If you 
never use Control Center
, stop it from launching automatically:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.controlcenter
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.controlcenter

ð 
Now macOS wonât restart it at boot.

ð¡ï¸ Step 4: Make It Useless but Keep It Running

To 
apply the "zombie" method
, we 
make Control Center completely non-functional
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo chflags uchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

ð 
This creates a locked "ghost" version that macOS canât replace or execute.
 ð

ð¡ï¸ Step 5: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After reboot, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCenter
sudo lsof -i -P | grep ControlCenter
launchctl list | grep ControlCenter

ð 
If no output appears, Control Center is officially neutered.
 ð

ð Final Verdict: Control Center Is Now Just an Empty Shell

â 
Still "exists," but canât connect to anything.

â 
Still "running," but canât be used.

â 
Firewall + Lulu keep it from talking to Apple.

ð 
Now you have TWO zombies locked in their cagesâ
rapportd
 and Control Center!

You said:

great - now lastly I wanted to install that autopsy thing? 

ChatGPT said:

ð Installing Autopsy (Digital Forensics Tool) on macOS ð

ð¥ 
Autopsy
 is a powerful 
digital forensics tool
 used for analyzing files, drives, and logs. Letâs get it running on macOS.

â Step 1: Install Java (Required for Autopsy)

Autopsy 
requires Java
, so first, install OpenJDK:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install openjdk

After installation, 
link Java to your system path
:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

ð 
Now Java is ready!

â Step 2: Install Sleuth Kit (Autopsyâs Backend)

Autopsy 
relies on The Sleuth Kit
, so we install i
