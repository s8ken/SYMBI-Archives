Fantastic! ð 
Your ClamAV virus database is now fully updated.
 â

The 
"ERROR: NULL X509 store"
 message is related to missing SSL/TLS certificates, but since the updates completed successfully, itâs nothing to worry about. However, we can fix it later if needed.

Step 16: Run a Virus Scan

Now, letâs test ClamAV by scanning your 
Downloads
 folder.

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r ~/Downloads

What Happens Next?

ClamAV will scan all files in your 
Downloads
 folder.

If it finds any threats, it will report them.

If you see 
"Infected files: 0"
, then your files are clean. â

ð Try running the scan and let me know the results! ð

Boom! ð¥ 
Your system is cleanâno infected files found!
 âð

ClamAV is now fully 
installed, updated, and working perfectly
 on your Mac. ð¡ï¸ð

Whatâs Next? (Optional)

If you want to 
automate scans
 or make ClamAV run in the background, here are some extra things you can do:

1ï¸â£ Schedule a Daily Scan (Optional)

Want ClamAV to automatically scan your 
home directory
 every night at midnight? Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

"0 0 * * * clamscan -r --bell --log=/Users/
$(whoami)

/clamav-scan.log ~/" | crontab -

This schedules a scan 
every midnight
.

Results will be saved in 
~/clamav-scan.log
.

2ï¸â£ Start ClamAV as a Background Service

If you want ClamAV to 
run in the background
 and scan files automatically, start the ClamAV daemon:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo brew services start clamav

ð This runs 
ClamAV in real-time
, scanning files as they are accessed.

3ï¸â£ Clean Up ClamAV Logs (If Needed)

If you want to free up space from old logs and temporary files, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /opt/homebrew/var/lib/clamav/*
sudo freshclam

Final Thoughts

You now have 
a fully functional antivirus system
 running on your Mac! ð¡ï¸â¡

You can run scans 
anytime
 with:

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r ~/Downloads

or

sh

Copy

Edit

clamscan -r /

(for a full system scan).

Let me know if you need anything else! ðð¥
