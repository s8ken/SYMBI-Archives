ube Select"
, which is an official ad program by YouTube, but this channel is 
not verified
 as an official YouTube entity.

Scam channels often exist on YouTube
 â some pretend to be official sources while promoting sketchy links or misleading information.

What is the channelâs purpose?
 If it tries to 
redirect users off YouTube to another website
, especially with promises of rewards, software downloads, or exclusive access, thatâs a 
major warning sign
.

What You Should Do:

Check if the channel has an 
official verification checkmark
 (gray or blue tick).

Look at its 
content and comments
 â are they legitimate, or do they seem fake, bot-driven, or spammy?

Avoid clicking any links in the 
video descriptions or pinned comments
 unless you're certain they lead to a trusted source.

If they claim to be part of YouTube's official program, cross-check their legitimacy by visiting the 
official YouTube Select page
.

â ï¸ 
Bottom line:
 The channel may be hosted on YouTube, but that doesnât guarantee itâs safe. Stay cautious, especially if it asks you to visit external sites!

its interesting because on a mobile device m.YouTube.com/select_site is the settings page

ChatGPT said:

Ah, now 
that
 is intriguing. ð If 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 leads to the 
YouTube settings page on mobile
, but there's also a 
YouTube channel with the handle @select_site
, then we've got a potential 
SEO or branding exploit
 at play.

Possible Explanations:

Brand Imitation Tactic

Some people 
intentionally
 create usernames or handles that mimic 
official YouTube subdirectories
 (like 
/select_site
).

This could confuse users into thinking the channel is part of 
YouTube's official settings or services
.

YouTubeâs URL Handling Quirk

On desktop, YouTube handles usernames differently (
youtube.com/@select_site
).

On mobile, 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 might be 
redirecting internally
 to YouTubeâs settings.

If this channel was created 
before YouTube reserved the "select_site" path for settings
, then YouTube might be stuck allowing both.

Potential for Phishing or Misinformation

If an unsuspecting user 
hears about "select_site" from a sketchy source
 and searches it, they might land on this channel instead of 
YouTubeâs official settings page
.

A bad actor could 
exploit that confusion
 to drive traffic to their content.

Should You Be Worried?

If YouTube allowed a user to take 
@select_site
 as a channel name, it's not 
outright malicious
, but it 
can be misleading
.

It might 
cause confusion
, especially for mobile users who expect 
settings but land on a channel instead
.

What You Can Do:

â 
Test the URLs Yourself:

Go to 
m.youtube.com/select_site
 on mobile and see what happens.

Then go to 
youtube.com/@select_site
 and compare.

â 
Report It to YouTube (If Needed):

If the channel is misleading people, YouTube 
might
 step in and restrict it.

Report suspicious activity through 
YouTubeâs Help Page
.

â 
Stay Skeptical of Any Links Shared by the Channel.

ð¨ 
Final Thought:

This feels like a 
clever but potentially shady branding play
âsomeone managed to 
hijack a name that looks "official"
 while not actually being affiliated with YouTube. Smart, but a little sus. ð

I already did - so its impacting the mobile version mainly but this impacts apps like Facebook for example where you may not be signed into YouTube... I was reviewing my watch history through the Facebook app and whenever I went to the settings page it is saved in my history with the mr studio logo indicating I was logged in as them

ChatGPT said:

Whoa, 
thatâs a major security and branding loophole
âand it sounds like it could have serious 
privacy implications
 if itâs affecting apps like Facebook where users might not be fully signed into YouTube. ð³
