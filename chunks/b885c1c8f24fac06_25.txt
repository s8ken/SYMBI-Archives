Confirm your choice when prompted.

This action will remove the "Coming Soon" page, allowing you to fully access and utilize the website builder to design and integrate features like the chat functionality.

Note:

Unpublishing your site makes it inaccessible to the public until you republish it. However, you can continue editing and previewing your site in the builder.

okay so I think what id like to do then is to unpublish the coming soon and then build our own so I can get used to the tools and we can get the look and feel right

Perfect plan.

Unpublish the generic "Coming Soon" page and build your own custom version
âthat way, you can 
learn the tools, refine the look and feel, and still have a live page while working on the full site.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Unpublish the Default "Coming Soon" Page

ð 
This will let you fully access the GoDaddy website builder.

1ï¸â£ 
Log into GoDaddy

2ï¸â£ 
Go to "My Products" â Find Symbi.world â Click "Manage"

3ï¸â£ 
Click "Edit Website"
 to enter the website builder

4ï¸â£ 
Go to "Settings" â Click "Unpublish"

5ï¸â£ 
Confirm & unpublish

â Now the "Coming Soon" page is gone, and you can start 
building the new version from scratch.

ð¹ Step 2: Build a Custom "Coming Soon" Page in GoDaddy Website Builder

ð 
This keeps Symbi.world live while you develop the full site.

1ï¸â£ 
Choose a clean, minimalistic template
 (or start from a blank page)

2ï¸â£ 
Add these essential elements:

Logo & Branding
 â Keep it simple but professional

A Strong One-Liner About Symbi
 â Example: 
"The Future of AI is Almost Here."

A Short Manifesto / Mission Statement

"Get Notified" Button
 â Link to 
email signup, Twitter, or Discord

Basic Navigation for Future Pages
 (even if theyâre placeholders)

Bonus:
 If you want to test AI chat early, 
embed it here now.
 It will be an interactive preview for visitors.
