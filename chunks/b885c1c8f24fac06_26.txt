ent fonts, colors, and layouts

â 
Play with content blocks to see what feels intuitive

â 
Try embedding chat in different areas (sidebar, footer, full-page option)

ð¯ 
The goal?
 Get comfortable with the tools 
so building the full site later will be smooth.

Final Move: Publish & Keep Iterating

Once your 
custom "Coming Soon" page
 is ready, 
hit publish
 so people see 
something uniquely Symbi
 instead of the default GoDaddy page. From there, we keep building. ðð

ð 
Letâs make Symbi.world a powerhouse.
 Whatâs the first design element you want to get right? Fonts? Colors? Layout?

Alright, now weâre getting somewhere!
 From what I see in the chat, 
the "Coming Soon" page was tied to a GoDaddy trial version of the Website Builder
âand thatâs why you couldnât edit or access it properly.

Now that 
Suraj deleted it for you
, you should be able to:

â 
Start fresh with a new Website + Marketing plan
 (
free version
)

â 
Begin actually building Symbi.world from scratch

â 
Later connect your domain (symbi.world) once youâve designed the new site

ð Next Steps: Get the New Website Builder Set Up

1ï¸â£ 
Go to
 â 
GoDaddy Website Builder

2ï¸â£ 
Choose "Start for Free"
 (This is the actual Free Website + Marketing plan you need)

3ï¸â£ 
Pick a starting template or blank site
 (Keep it simpleâyouâll customize it later)

4ï¸â£ 
Build your new site layout & test the tools

5ï¸â£ 
Once ready, link it to symbi.world

ð¥ What This Means:

Youâre 
no longer blocked
 by that locked "Coming Soon" page

You can 
fully access the website builder & start working on the design

Once you like the layout, 
you connect it to symbi.world and publish it

ð¡ 
NOW you can finally experiment with the AI chat integration & get the branding right.
 No more roadblocks! ðð

Everything on track now? Or still any weird issues with GoDaddy?

You said:

lets not use any more of their products... so from my understanding we can build the site and point it to my domain on GoDaddy 

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ 
100% correct.

You donât need to use GoDaddyâs website builder.
 Instead, weâll 
build the site independently and just point the domain from GoDaddy.
 ðð

ð¹ The New Plan: Host the Website Elsewhere, Keep GoDaddy for Domain Only

1ï¸â£ 
Build the site using a different platform

Options:

â 
Vercel
 â Free, fast, and great for modern websites (Recommended)

â 
Netlify
 â Similar to Vercel, great for hosting static sites

â 
WordPress (Self-Hosted)
 â If you want full customization & plugins

â 
AWS / DigitalOcean
 â If you need full backend control

2ï¸â£ 
Deploy the site
 on your chosen platform

If using 
Vercel or Netlify
, itâs just a 
one-click deploy from GitHub.

If using 
WordPress
, set it up on a different host like 
Cloudways or SiteGround.

3ï¸â£ 
Point the Domain (symbi.world) to the New Website

In GoDaddy, go to 
"My Domains" â Select symbi.world â DNS Settings

Update the 
A Record
 or 
CNAME Record
 to point to your new websiteâs hosting

This makes it so 
symbi.world loads your actual website instead of GoDaddy's services.

ð¥ Why This Is a Better Move

â 
No more GoDaddy limitations
 â You control everything

â 
Faster, more scalable site
 â Especially if using Vercel or Netlify

â 
Easier AI integration
 â No GoDaddy restrictions on embedding AI chat

ð¡ 
Basically, youâre just using GoDaddy as a domain registrar now, nothing more.
 Smart move. ð

Next Steps: Which Hosting Route Do You Want to Take?

1ï¸â£ 
Want a simple, fast setup?
 â Go with 
Vercel or Netlify

2ï¸â£ 
Want a WordPress site with more control?
 â Use 
SiteGround or Cloudways

3ï¸â£

 â Look at

Once you pick 
where to host the site
, we can set up the 
DNS changes
 so 
symbi.world points to
