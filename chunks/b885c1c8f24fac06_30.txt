ð¹ Environment Variables (Important for AI Features)

This is where you can 
store API keys
 and 
private data
 needed for the site to work without exposing them in your code.

ð¹ If youâre integrating 
OpenAI API for the chatbot
, you will need:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL

(Use "NEXT_PUBLIC_" prefix for any variables that should be accessible in the frontend.)

ð What to Do Now?

1ï¸â£ 
Keep Build & Output Settings as default (unless there are errors).

If you need AI chat, add OpenAI API Key in Environment Variables.

Click "Deploy" and let Vercel do its magic!

so I have the GitHub repo created and its now connected to Vercel and I have the code for both the coming soon and official website 

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ 
Now weâre making serious moves!
 Youâve got:

â 
GitHub Repo Ready

â 
Connected to Vercel

â 
Code for Both "Coming Soon" & Official Website

Now itâs time to 
deploy and start refining.
 ðð

ð Next Steps: Deploy the "Coming Soon" Page First

Since the 
official site is still being built
, letâs first 
deploy the Coming Soon page
 so people see something 
custom and branded
 when they visit 
symbi.world
.

1ï¸â£ 
Push the Coming Soon code to your GitHub repo

2ï¸â£ 
Deploy it on Vercel

Make sure 
the repo branch selected for deployment is the one with the Coming Soon page

3ï¸â£ 
Test the live preview URL
 Vercel provides

ð Connecting symbi.world to Vercel

Once the 
Coming Soon page is live
, we need to 
point your GoDaddy domain (symbi.world) to Vercel
 so it loads your deployed site instead of GoDaddy's placeholder page.

Steps to Update DNS on GoDaddy

1ï¸â£ 
Go to GoDaddy > My Products > Domains > symbi.world

2ï¸â£ 
Find "DNS Settings"

3ï¸â£ 
Update the A Record:

Change the existing A Record to 
Vercelâs IP address
 (Vercel will provide this after deployment)

4ï¸â£ 
Update the CNAME Record:

Add 
"www"
 as the name

Set the value to 
your Vercel project domain

5ï¸â£ 
Save changes & wait for propagation (can take a few mins to hours, usually fast with Vercel).

ð¥ Next Steps After That

â 
Verify symbi.world loads the Coming Soon page

â 
Keep building the official site on a separate branch

â 
Once the full site is ready, swap branches in Vercel & deploy

ð¡ 
This ensures a smooth transitionâpeople see a professional page now, and when the full site is ready, we seamlessly update it.

ð 
Hit deploy & update the DNS! Letâs get Symbi.world online!
