alright best we do one at a time here so I learn as we go - I don't have a local project folder yet... is that why it says clone your GitHub repo to local machine?

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ 
Yes, exactly!
 Since your GitHub repo is currently empty, 
you need to clone it to your local machine
 so you can add your code and push it back up. This will create a local folder where you can work on the project. ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Clone Your GitHub Repo to Your Local Machine

1ï¸â£ 
Copy your GitHub repo URL:

Go to your repo on GitHub

Click the 
âCodeâ
 button (green)

Copy the 
HTTPS URL

2ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows) and navigate to where you want the project folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /path/to/your/preferred/location

(Example: 
cd ~/Documents/Projects
)

3ï¸â£ 
Run this command to clone the repo:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

clone

 <your-repo-url>

Example:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

clone

 https://github.com/yourusername/symbi-website.git

â 
Now you have a local project folder with your GitHub repo inside it!

ð¹ Step 2: Navigate Into the Project Folder

Once cloning is complete, move into the project folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi-website

(
Replace 
symbi-website
 with your actual repo name.
)

ð¹ Step 3: Add Your "Coming Soon" Code Into This Folder

Now that the folder is on your machine, you can:

â 
Copy your "Coming Soon" page code into this directory.

â 
Make any edits or customizations if needed.

â 
Then push it back to GitHub.

ð Next Move:

Once you've added your code, let me know, and weâll 
commit & push it back to GitHub.

okay so I think I want to put it straight into 'Proton Drive' and in there I just created a folder called 'Symbi Website"

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ 
Smart moveâkeeping everything organized in Proton Drive!
 Now, letâs make sure your 
Git repo is linked to that folder
 so any updates in Proton Drive can be pushed to GitHub. ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Link Your Proton Drive Folder to GitHub

Since Proton Drive is 
a cloud storage solution
, it doesnât natively support Git.

But 
you can still use Git in a folder inside Proton Drive
 as long as it syncs properly.

1ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows).

2ï¸â£ 
Navigate to your Proton Drive folder where you created "Symbi Website":

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

"/path/to/Proton Drive/Symbi Website"

ð¹ 
If your path has spaces, make sure to use quotes!

3ï¸â£ 
Initialize Git inside this folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

git init

4ï¸â£ 
Link it to your GitHub repo:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

(Replace 
<your-repo-url>
 with the actual URL of your GitHub repo.)

ð¹ Step 2: Add Your "Coming Soon" Code to the Folder

Now, 
place your "Coming Soon" page files
 inside 
"Symbi Website"
 in Proton Drive.

â If it's a Next.js project, the folder should contain:

bash

Copy

Edit

/pages
/public
/styles
package.json
next.config.js

â If it's a simple HTML page, just place:

diff

Copy

Edit

index.html

styles.css

ð¹ Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

Once the files are inside your Proton Drive folder, 
push them to GitHub
:

1ï¸â£ 
Go back to Terminal/Git Bash (while inside "Symbi Website" folder)

2ï¸â£ 
Stage all files:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .

3ï¸â£ 
Commit with a message:

bash

Copy

Edit

git commit -m 

"Added Coming Soon page"

4ï¸â£ 
Push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

â 
Now your "Coming Soon" page is in GitHub!
