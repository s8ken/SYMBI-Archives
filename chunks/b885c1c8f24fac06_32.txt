No worriesâthis just means we need to use the correct file path for Proton Drive.
 Letâs find it and navigate properly. ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Find the Correct Path to Proton Drive

Since Proton Drive syncs to your local machine, we need to locate the 
exact path where your "Symbi Website" folder is stored.

Option 1: Use Finder to Find the Path (Easiest)

1ï¸â£ 
Open Finder
 on your Mac.

2ï¸â£ 
Go to your Proton Drive folder
 and find 
"Symbi Website".

3ï¸â£ 
Right-click the folder
 â Click 
"Get Info"

4ï¸â£ 
Look for "Where:"
 â This shows the full path.

5ï¸â£ 
Copy the path and use it in Terminal.

Option 2: Use Terminal to Find It

1ï¸â£ 
Run this command to list directories in your home folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 ~

This will show you all folders inside your user directory.

Look for something like 
"Proton Drive"
 or 
"Proton"

2ï¸â£ 
If you see Proton Drive, navigate into it:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Proton\ Drive/

The 
\
 before the space ensures 
Terminal reads it correctly.

3ï¸â£ 
Once inside, list folders again to confirm:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

You should see 
"Symbi Website"
 in the list.

4ï¸â£ 
Now navigate into it:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

"Symbi Website"

ð 
Now you're in the correct folder!

ð¹ Step 2: Initialize Git & Connect to GitHub

Once inside 
"Symbi Website"
, follow the 
Git setup steps from earlier
:

1ï¸â£ 
Initialize Git:

bash

Copy

Edit

git init

2ï¸â£ 
Add the GitHub repo:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

3ï¸â£ 
Add & commit your files:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added Coming Soon page"

4ï¸â£ 
Push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

â 
Now your "Coming Soon" page should be in GitHub, ready for Vercel deployment!

Let me know if you hit any issues. 
You got this!

Got it!
 The issue here is that 
Proton Drive isnât appearing as a standard directory on your Mac.
 Thatâs why you canât 
cd
 into it from Terminal.

ð¹ Fix: Find the Actual Path to Proton Drive

Since Proton Drive is 
mounted differently
 than normal folders, you need to find its actual path.

Option 1: Drag & Drop Into Terminal (Fastest)

1ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal

2ï¸â£ 
Drag the "Symbi Website" folder from Finder into the Terminal window

3ï¸â£ 
It will auto-fill the correct path

4ï¸â£ 
Press Enter to navigate into it

Option 2: Manually Find the Path

1ï¸â£ 
In Terminal, try this command:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Volumes/

ls

If Proton Drive is mounted as a volume, it might appear here.

If you see something like 
ProtonDrive
, use:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Volumes/ProtonDrive/Symbi\ Website/

2ï¸â£ 
If that doesn't work, try checking the 
~/Library/CloudStorage/
 directory:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Library/CloudStorage/

ls

Proton might be mounted inside here.

ð Next Steps

Once you 
successfully navigate to the correct folder
, follow the 
Git setup steps from earlier
 to:

â 
Initialize Git

â 
Add the remote GitHub repo

â 
Commit & push the Coming Soon page

Let me know if you get stuckâ
weâll get this sorted!
