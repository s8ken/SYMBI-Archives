o to 
v0.dev
 and find your Symbi AI website project

2ï¸â£ 
Download the Next.js code it generated

3ï¸â£ 
Extract the files and move them into your "Symbi Website" folder

ð¹ After moving the files, check that the folder has:

bash

Copy

Edit

/pages
/public
/styles
package.json
next.config.js

â Now, your Next.js project is ready to be pushed to GitHub.

ð Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Decide which version to use (HTML or Next.js from v0.dev).

2ï¸â£ 
Place the files inside the "Symbi Website" folder.

3ï¸â£ 
Run these in Terminal to push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added Coming Soon page"

git push -u origin main

4ï¸â£ 
Once itâs in GitHub, we deploy it on Vercel!

which version you want to go with, and Iâll help with the next step.

Perfect!
 Youâve got the full 
Next.js project structure
 from v0.dev inside your 
"symbi-ai-website"
 folder. Now letâs push this to GitHub and deploy it to Vercel! ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Navigate to the Project Folder in Terminal

Since your folder is called 
"symbi-ai-website"
, run this in Terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

(Adjust if needed based on your actual Proton Drive path.)

To confirm youâre in the right folder, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

â If it lists files like 

package.json

, 

next.config.mjs

, and folders like 

app/

, then youâre good to go.

ð¹ Step 2: Initialize Git & Connect to GitHub (If Not Done Already)

If you havenât initialized Git inside this folder yet, do this:

bash

Copy

Edit

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi.git
git remote -v  

# (Check that it's correctly linked)

â If you already did this before, skip to Step 3.

ð¹ Step 3: Add, Commit, and Push the Code to GitHub

Now, letâs get your files pushed to GitHub:

1ï¸â£ 
Stage all files for commit:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .

2ï¸â£ 
Commit the changes with a message:

bash

Copy

Edit

git commit -m 

"Added Symbi Coming Soon page"

3ï¸â£ 
Push the code to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

â 
Your full project should now be in GitHub!
 ð

ð Step 4: Deploy on Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel

2ï¸â£ 
Create a New Project
 â Select 
"Import from GitHub"

3ï¸â£ 
Find & select your 
Symbi
 repo

4ï¸â£ 
Framework Preset
 â Select 
"Next.js"

5ï¸â£ 
Click "Deploy"!

Vercel will build and deploy your site, giving you a 
live preview link
 once itâs done.

ð¥ Next Move: Connect symbi.world to Vercel

Once your site is live, weâll update your 
GoDaddy DNS settings
 so 
symbi.world
 points to the Vercel-hosted version.

ð 
Let me know once the GitHub push is done, and weâll move to Vercel!

You're almost there!
 Just a small fixâyour terminal is showing 
quote>
 which means it's 
stuck inside some input mode
 (possibly from copying commands in bulk).

ð¹ How to Fix It

1ï¸â£ 
Press 
Ctrl + C

 to exit the 
quote>
 mode.

2ï¸â£ 
Then manually re-run these commands one by one:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added Symbi Coming Soon page"

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

â 
This will properly stage, commit, and push your code to GitHub.

Once itâs pushed, 
check GitHub
 to confirm the files are there. Then we move to 
Vercel deployment!

Got it!
 The error 
"fatal: not a git repository"
 means Git 
wasn't properly initialized
 in your folder, or it got removed somehow.

ð¹ Step 1: Reinitialize Git in the Correct Folder

Since youâre already inside

bash

git init
