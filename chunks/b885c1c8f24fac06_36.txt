You're so close!
 The error is happening because 
GitHub no longer supports password authentication
 when pushing via HTTPS. Instead, you need to use a 
personal access token (PAT)
 or 
set up SSH authentication.
 ðð

ð¹ Fix: Use a Personal Access Token (Recommended)

Instead of using your 
GitHub password
, you need to generate a 
Personal Access Token (PAT)
 and use that as the password.

1ï¸â£ Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

Go to 
GitHub Personal Access Tokens

Click 
"Generate new token"

Select 
"Classic" token

Set an 
expiration date
 (or "No expiration" if you donât want to generate a new one often).

Under 
scopes
, enable:

â 
repo
 (Full control of private repositories)

â 
workflow
 (To allow CI/CD if needed)

Click 
"Generate token"
 and 
copy it immediately
 (GitHub wonât show it again).

2ï¸â£ Use the Token Instead of Your Password

Now, try pushing again, but when Git asks for a 
password
, enter your 
Personal Access Token (PAT)
 instead.

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main

â 
When prompted for a password, paste your PAT instead.

ð¹ Alternative: Use SSH Authentication (If You Want a Permanent Fix)

If you donât want to deal with tokens, you can 
set up SSH authentication
 so you never have to enter a password again.

1ï¸â£ 
Check if you already have an SSH key:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -al ~/.ssh

If you see files like 
id_rsa.pub
 or 
id_ed25519.pub
, you already have one.

If 
no SSH key exists
, generate one:

bash

Copy

Edit

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C 

"your-email@example.com"

(Press 
Enter
 to save it in the default location, and optionally set a passphrase.)

2ï¸â£ 
Add the SSH key to GitHub:

Copy the key to your clipboard:

bash

Copy

Edit

cat

 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Go to 
GitHub SSH Keys

Click 
"New SSH Key"
 â Paste the key and save it.

3ï¸â£ 
Update your Git remote to use SSH instead of HTTPS:

bash

Copy

Edit

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:s8ken/Symbi.git

Now, try pushing again:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main

â 
This will push without asking for a password.

ð Next Step: Deploy on Vercel

Once your code is in GitHub, weâll 
deploy it on Vercel and make Symbi.world live.
 Let me know 
when youâve successfully pushed the code!
