are resolved and changes are staged, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git rebase --

continue

â 
This finalizes the rebase process.

ð¹ Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once the rebase completes, push the updated branch to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

â 
This will update the remote repository with your latest changes.

ð Next Step: Deploy on Vercel

Once GitHub is updated, weâll 
connect it to Vercel and go live!

Let me know when the push is successful. ðð¥

You're in great shape!

You're hitting a swap file issue because Git is opening your commit message in 
vim
 (a terminal-based editor), and there's a leftover crash file.
 No worries, let's fix this fast. ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Exit Vim Safely

Right now, Git is waiting for you to 
close the commit message editor
. To exit without making changes, do the following:

1ï¸â£ 
Press 
Esc

 (just to make sure youâre out of editing mode).

2ï¸â£ 
Type:

less

Copy

Edit

:

q

!

(This tells Vim to 
quit without saving
.)

3ï¸â£ 
Press 
Enter

ð¹ Step 2: Delete the Swap File

Since thereâs a leftover 
.swp
 file from a previous Git operation, delete it:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website/.git/.COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp

â 
This removes the swap file and prevents Vim from blocking your commit.

ð¹ Step 3: Resume the Rebase

Now that the swap file is gone, 
run the rebase command again:

bash

Copy

Edit

git rebase --

continue

â If the commit message editor opens again, 
save and close
:

If using Vim:
 Press 
i
 (to enter insert mode), then 
Esc
, type 
:wq
, and press 
Enter
.

If using Nano:
 Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

ð¹ Step 4: Push to GitHub

Once the rebase is successful, 
push the changes
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

ð 
This should finally complete everything and sync your repo with GitHub!

Let me know if you hit any more snagsâweâre 
so close
 to deployment! ðð¥

If you're feeling stuck or unsure, you can safely abort the rebase and start fresh.
 This will reset your repo to how it was 
before you ran 
git rebase

, so you can retry.

You have a few options here, but the best move is to delete the swap file so you can continue cleanly.
