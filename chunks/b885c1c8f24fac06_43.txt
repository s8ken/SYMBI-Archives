 sure where I am typing

Gotcha! Youâre inside Vim, and it can be tricky if you're not used to it. Letâs get you unstuck and finish this.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Check If Youâre in Insert Mode

Since Vim has different modes, you need to 
exit insert mode first
 before you can type commands.

ð 
Press 
Esc
 multiple times
 to ensure youâre 
out of insert mode.

(If you hear a beep or see nothing happening, that means youâve successfully exited insert mode.)

ð¹ Step 2: Save & Exit Vim

Now, 
type the following exactly
:

ruby

Copy

Edit

:wq

â 
Then press 
Enter
.

(If 
:wq
 appears inside the commit message again, it means you werenât out of insert modeâtry pressing 
Esc
 first, then retry 
:wq
.)

ð¹ Alternative: If Vim Won't Close

If for some reason 
:wq
 isnât working, try force-quitting without saving:

less

Copy

Edit

:

q

!

â 
Press 
Enter

(This will 
exit without saving
, and you can restart the commit message if needed.)

ð¹ Step 3: Resume the Rebase (If Needed)

If you exited Vim and still need to finish the rebase, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git rebase --

continue

Then 
try saving the commit message again
 following the steps above.

ð Next Step: Push to GitHub

Once everything is done, push to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

ð¥ 
You're so closeâthis is the last step before deployment!
 ð Let me know if youâre still stuck inside Vim, and Iâll guide you out. ð

You're still in INSERT mode in Vim!
 Thatâs why 
:wq
 is appearing as text instead of running the command.

ð¹ Step 1: Exit INSERT Mode

ð 
Press 
Esc

once or twice
 until you no longer see 
-- INSERT --
 at the bottom.

â This takes you out of insert mode so you can enter Vim commands.

ð¹ Step 2: Save & Exit Vim

Once youâve pressed 
Esc
 and youâre out of INSERT mode, type:

ruby

Copy

Edit

:wq

â 
Then press 
Enter
.

ð¥ 
That should finally close Vim and let Git continue the rebase!

ð¹ Step 3: Push to GitHub

After Vim exits, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

â 
Now your code should be live in GitHub!

Got it!
 You're out of 
INSERT mode
, but you're not seeing where 
:wq
 is going. No worriesâletâs get this wrapped up properly. ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Make Sure You're in Command Mode

You already 
pressed 
Esc

, so 
INSERT mode is gone
âgood! Now, do the following:

1ï¸â£ 
Make sure you don't type anything yet.

2ï¸â£ 
Carefully type
 (without pressing 
i
 or anything else):

ruby

Copy

Edit

:wq

â 
It wonât appear in the text area like normal typingâitâs a Vim command.

3ï¸â£ 
Press 
Enter

ð¹ Step 2: If 
:wq
 Still Appears in Text

If 

:wq
 is still appearing in the file as text
, do this instead:

1ï¸â£ 
Press 
Esc
 multiple times
 to make 100% sure youâre out of insert mode.

2ï¸â£ 
Try quitting without saving
 (just to test):

less

Copy

Edit

:

q

!

â 
If that exits Vim, it means your commit message is still fine, and we can redo the rebase if needed.

ð¹ Step 3: Resume the Rebase (If Needed)

If you had to quit with 
:q!
, Git will still be waiting for you to continue. Just run:

bash

Copy

Edit

git rebase --

continue

â 
Then try saving again in Vim.

ð¹ Step 4: Push to GitHub

Once you're finally out of Vim, push your changes:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

ð 
This is the last hurdle before deployment!
 Let me know what happens! ðð¥
