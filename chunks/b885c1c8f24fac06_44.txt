Alright, letâs get around this Vim issue and finish the rebase manually.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Manually Complete the Rebase Without Vim

Since Vim (
vi
) is causing issues, letâs 
tell Git to use a different method
 to complete the commit.

ð 
Try this instead:

bash

Copy

Edit

git rebase --

continue

 --no-edit

â 
This tells Git to finish the rebase without opening an editor.

ð¹ Step 2: If That Doesnât Work, Use a Manual Commit

If Git still complains, try manually committing the staged changes:

bash

Copy

Edit

git commit -m 

"Rebased and resolved conflicts"

git rebase --

continue

â 
Now Git should mark the rebase as done.

ð¹ Step 3: Push Your Changes to GitHub

Once the rebase is complete, 
push your updated branch
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

â 
Now everything should be synced with GitHub!

ð¥ 
Let me know if you run into any errorsâwe're super close to deployment!

Alright, letâs get this sorted manually! Since 
--no-edit
 isnât recognized, weâll work around it.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Set a Different Editor (Bypass Vim)

Since Vim (
vi
) is causing issues, letâs 
switch Git to use Nano (easier editor) instead
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git config --global core.editor 

"nano"

â 
This forces Git to use Nano instead of Vim for commit messages.

Now, try continuing the rebase:

bash

Copy

Edit

git rebase --

continue

If Nano opens instead of Vim:

Just 
save and exit
:

Press 
CTRL + X

Press 
Y
 (to confirm saving)

Press 
Enter

ð¹ Step 2: If That Doesnât Work, Do a Manual Commit

If 
git rebase --continue
 still fails, manually commit the changes instead:

bash

Copy

Edit

git commit -m 

"Rebased and resolved conflicts"

git rebase --

continue

â 
This should let Git finish the rebase.

ð¹ Step 3: Push to GitHub

Once the rebase is complete, push your changes:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

â 
Now everything should be fully synced with GitHub!

ð¥ 
Let me know if you hit any snags! Weâre almost there!

YES! You did it!
 Your rebase is finally complete! ðð

ð¹ Final Step: Push Your Changes to GitHub

Now that everything is resolved, letâs 
sync your branch with GitHub
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git push -u origin main --force

â 
This updates your GitHub repo with all the latest changes.

ð Next: Deploy on Vercel

Once the push is successful, weâll move on to 
deploying your site on Vercel
 and connecting
