Dependency conflict! But no worriesâwe can fix this.
 ðð

Your build failed because 

react-day-picker@8.10.1
 wants an older version of 
date-fns
, but your project uses 
date-fns@4.1.0

.

ð¹ Step 1: Fix Dependencies Locally

Since Vercel is running 
npm install
, letâs 
fix the issue in your local project first
.

1ï¸â£ 
Go to your project folder in Terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

2ï¸â£ 
Force-install dependencies to bypass conflicts:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

â This tells npm to 
ignore peer dependency conflicts
 and install everything.

ð¹ Step 2: Verify It Works

Once installation is complete, test locally:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

â 
If the site runs locally without issues, then itâs fixed.

ð¹ Step 3: Push the Fix to GitHub

If the fix works, push it to GitHub so Vercel can pull the new dependencies:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package-lock.json package.json
git commit -m 

"Fix dependency conflict with date-fns"

git push origin main

ð¹ Step 4: Redeploy on Vercel

Once pushed, go back to Vercel and 
redeploy your project
:

1ï¸â£ 
Go to Vercel Dashboard â Your Project

2ï¸â£ Click 
"Redeploy"

â This time, it should install without errors!

ð¥ 
Try these steps and let me know if the build succeeds!

Your system doesnât recognize 
npm
, which means Node.js is either not installed or not properly set up in your terminal.
 No worriesâletâs fix it fast! ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Check If Node.js Is Installed

Run this command to check if Node.js is installed:

bash

Copy

Edit

node -v

â If it returns a version like 
v18.x.x
, then Node.js is installed.

â 
If it says "command not found,"
 you need to install Node.js.

ð¹ Step 2: Install or Fix Node.js

If 
node -v
 fails, install Node.js 
via Homebrew (Recommended for Mac users)
:

bash

Copy

Edit

brew install node
