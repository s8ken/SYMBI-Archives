loads okay except the logo didn't show and there's an error notification and when I click on that: Console Error

Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used

- A server/client branch 
if (typeof window !== 'undefined')
.
- Variable input such as 
Date.now()
 or 
Math.random()
 which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

- style={{color-scheme:"dark"}}

Good catch!
 This is a 
Next.js hydration error
, meaning the 
server-side rendered (SSR) HTML doesnât match what the client expects
. 
Letâs fix this issue step by step.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Identify the Cause

This can happen if 
a component relies on client-only values
 like:

â 
Date.now()
, 
Math.random()

â Checking 
window
 without 
useEffect

â External APIs changing data 
without pre-fetching

Common Causes in Your Case:

1ï¸â£ 
Dark Mode (
className="dark"
)
 â If theme switching logic runs 
differently
 on the server vs client.

2ï¸â£ 
A Component Using 
window
 Directly
 â Example:

tsx

Copy

Edit

if

 (

typeof

window

 !== 

'undefined'

) {

// client-only code

}

This needs to be inside 
useEffect
.

ð¹ Step 2: Fix the Hydration Issue

â Fix #1: Make Sure Theme Handling is Client-Side

Open 

theme-provider.tsx

 in your project and wrap the theme logic inside 
useEffect
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { useEffect, useState } 

from

"react"

;

export

function

ThemeProvider

(

{ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }

) {

const

 [theme, setTheme] = 

useState

(

"dark"

);

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

setTheme

(

document

.

documentElement

.

classList

.

contains

(

"dark"

) ? 

"dark"

 : 

"light"

);
  }, []);

return

<
div

className

=

{theme}

>{children}

</
div

>;
}

â 
Why?
 This ensures the theme 
only updates on the client
, avoiding mismatches with SSR.

â Fix #2: Ensure Any 
window
 Checks Are in 
useEffect

If any component uses 
window
, move it inside 
useEffect
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { useEffect, useState } 

from

"react"

;

const

MyComponent

 = (

) => {

const

 [isClient, setIsClient] = 

useState

(

false

);

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

setIsClient

(

true

);
  }, []);

return

 isClient ? 

<
div

>Client-Side Rendered

</
div

> : 

<
div

>Loading...

</
div

>;
};

â 
Why?
 This prevents the server from rendering 
window
, fixing hydration.

â Fix #3: Debug with 
useEffect
 (Temporary)

If the above fixes donât work, 
log hydration mismatches
 using 
useEffect
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

console

.

log

(

"Hydration debug:"

, 

document

.

body

.

innerHTML

);
}, []);

â 
Why?
 This helps track 
what's changing between SSR and client.

ð¹ Step 3: Fix the Logo Issue

Your 
logo might not be showing
 due to a 
missing file path or Next.js Image optimization issues
.

1ï¸â£ 
Ensure the logo exists in 
/public/

Correct file path:

tsx

Copy

Edit

<img src=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

 alt=

"Symbi Logo"

 width={

200

} height={

100

} />

If using 
next/image
, update it:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"Symbi Logo"

width

=

{200}

height

=

{100}

priority

 />

â 
Why?
 Next.js optimizes images and expects them inside 
/public/
.

ð¹ Step 4: Push the Fixes & Redeploy

1ï¸â£ 
Save the fixes and push them to GitHub
:

bash

Copy
