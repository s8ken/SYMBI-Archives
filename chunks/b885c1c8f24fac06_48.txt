Gotcha! Letâs slow it down and go step by step.
 Weâll 
first identify whatâs causing the hydration issue
, then 
fix it one piece at a time.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Identify Where the Error is Happening

Right now, Next.js is 
hydrating (re-rendering) the page on the client
, but something 
doesnât match the server-side rendered (SSR) HTML.

ð 
We need to find which component is causing the problem.

1ï¸â£ 
Open your terminal and stop the Next.js server

bash

Copy

Edit

CTRL + C

(This stops the 
npm run dev
 process.)

2ï¸â£ 
Restart it with this command
 (to see detailed logs):

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

â 
Look for console errorsâit may point to the component causing hydration issues.

3ï¸â£ 
Also check your browser console
 (Chrome: 
Right Click > Inspect > Console
).

If you see errors like 
"Hydration failed..."
, check what part of the page is breaking.

Does the error mention a specific component?

ð¹ Step 2: Debug Which Component is Causing the Issue

If 
the error doesnât show a clear component
, we can 
log which parts are rendering differently.

1ï¸â£ Open 

app/layout.tsx

 and add this debug line inside your 
useEffect
 hook:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { useEffect } 

from

"react"

;

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

console

.

log

(

"Hydration debug:"

, 

document

.

body

.

innerHTML

);
}, []);

2ï¸â£ Save and 
restart the server
 (
npm run dev
).

3ï¸â£ 
Check the browser console logs.

Does something look off?

Are parts of the page different from what the server expects?

ð¹ Step 3: Fix Common Hydration Issues

Once we know 
which component is breaking
, we can fix it.

â Fix: If Your Code Uses 
window
 or 
document

Next.js renders on the server first, and 
window
/
document
 donât exist on the server.

Solution:
 Wrap them inside 
useEffect
.

â 
Bad code (causes hydration issues)
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

if

 (

typeof

window

 !== 

"undefined"

) {

console

.

log

(

window

.

innerWidth

);
}

â 
Fix:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { useEffect } 

from

"react"

;

useEffect

(

() =>

 {

console

.

log

(

window

.

innerWidth

);
}, []);

â Fix: If Dark Mode or Class Name is Changing

Your error mentions 
className="dark"
 â This means 
your dark mode logic might be running differently on the client vs server.

Solution:
 Move dark mode logic to 
useEffect
 inside 
theme-provider.tsx

ð¹ Step 4: Fix the Logo Issue

Your 
logo might not be loading due to the wrong file path
.

1ï¸â£ 
Check if the logo exists
 inside 

public/

Go to 
public/
 â Look for 

symbi-logo.jpg

If itâs missing, move it into 
public/

2ï¸â£ 
Update the logo reference in your code

tsx

Copy

Edit

<img src=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

 alt=

"Symbi Logo"

 width={

200

} height={

100

} />

â 
Why?
 Next.js requires static assets to be inside the 
public/
 folder.

ð¹ Step 5: Push Fixes to GitHub & Redeploy

Once youâve made these changes:

1ï¸â£ 
Save your files

2ï¸â£ 
Commit and push to GitHub

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed hydration issue & logo path"

git push origin main

3ï¸â£ 
Go to Vercel â Click "Redeploy"

ð¥ 
Try this step-by-step and let me know where you are!
