No problem! Safari works too.
 Letâs check the console in Safari to see whatâs causing the hydration issue. ðð

[Error] A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch 
if (typeof window !== 'undefined')
.
- Variable input such as 
Date.now()
 or 
Math.random()
 which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

Got it! The issue is related to the 
className="dark"

color-scheme="dark"
 attributes being different between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side hydration.
