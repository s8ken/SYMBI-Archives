The message:

â Ready in 1377ms

â 
Means your local server is up and running.

ð¹ What to Do Next

1ï¸â£ 
Open Safari (or Chrome) and go to:

arduino

Copy

Edit

http:

//localhost:3000

â 
Check if the page loads correctly.

2ï¸â£ 
Check the browser console for errors:

Safari:

CMD + Option + C
 â Go to the 
Console
 tab

Chrome:

Right-click > Inspect > Console

3ï¸â£ 
Look for any React hydration errors.

If there are no errors, then 
we fixed it! ð

If thereâs still an issue, send me the console error so we can squash it.

ð¥ 
Let me know what happens! If itâs all good, we push to GitHub & deploy to Vercel!

Alright, let's break it down and fix whatâs wrong!
 ðð

From the screenshot, I see 
two main issues
:

1ï¸â£ 
The logo is missing
 (broken image).

2ï¸â£ 
The page is displaying "Coming Soon" correctly, but something looks off.

ð¹ Step 1: Fix the Broken Logo

The most likely reason the 
logo isnât showing
 is either:

â 
The image file is missing from 
/public/

â 
The file path is incorrect in your code

ð¹ Check if the Logo Exists in 
/public/

Run this command in your terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 public/

â 
Do you see 
symbi-logo.jpg
 or 
symbi-logo.png
 there?

If 
the logo isnât there
, move it to 
public/
:

bash

Copy

Edit

mv

 path-to-your-logo-file public/symbi-logo.jpg

ð¹ Update Your Code to Use the Correct Logo Path

Now, open your code where the logo is referenced.

If itâs inside 

app/page.tsx

 or another file, open it:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano app/page.tsx

Make sure your 
<img>
 tag looks like this:

tsx

Copy

Edit

<img src=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

 alt=

"SYMBI Logo"

 width={

200

} height={

100

} />

OR, if using Next.js' 
next/image
:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"SYMBI Logo"

width

=

{200}

height

=

{100}

priority

 />

â 
Why?
 Next.js requires images to be stored inside the 
public/
 folder, and the path should start with 
/
.

ð¹ Step 2: Check for Console Errors

Since we fixed the 
hydration error
, letâs check if any new errors popped up.

1ï¸â£ 
Open Safari Developer Console (
CMD + Option + C
)

2ï¸â£ Look for errors related to:

Images (
404 Not Found
)

Components failing to render

Copy-paste or screenshot any errors here.

ð¹ Step 3: Restart & Test

Once the logo is fixed:

1ï¸â£ 
Restart Next.js

bash

Copy

Edit

CTRL + C  

# (If running)

npm run dev

2ï¸â£ 
Refresh 
http://localhost:3000

3ï¸â£ 
Check if the logo appears & console errors are gone.

ð¹ Step 4: Push Fixes to GitHub & Redeploy

If everything looks good:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed missing logo issue"

git push origin main

Then go to 
Vercel & Click "Redeploy".

ð¥ 
Try this and let me know if the logo appears!
