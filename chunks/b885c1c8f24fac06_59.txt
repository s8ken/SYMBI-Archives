¹ Best Fix: Adjust Luluâs Settings

1ï¸â£ 
Open Lulu
 (click the menu bar icon).

2ï¸â£ 
Go to Preferences
 (or Rules).

3ï¸â£ 
Check these options:

â 
Allow Apple-signed programs
 (so system apps work)

â 
Allow installed programs
 (so Proton Drive and trusted apps arenât blocked)

4ï¸â£ 
Click Save & Restart Lulu.

ð¹ Step 2: Manually Allow Proton Drive (If Needed)

If Proton Drive 
still wonât sync
, open Luluâs 
Rules
 and manually allow it.

Restart 
Proton Drive
 and it should work fine!

ð¥ 
After this, Proton Drive should sync normally, and you can finish the website push!

You said:

cool - and while we are waiting I also have the code for the actual website I want to be working on - so the dev chat said to create a separate branch? 

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ 
Yes! Creating a separate branch is the best way to work on the actual website while keeping the "Coming Soon" version live.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Create a New Branch for the Main Website

Since youâre currently on the 
main
 branch (which has the "Coming Soon" page), youâll create a 
new branch
 for the full website.

1ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal and navigate to your project folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

2ï¸â£ 
Create a new branch called 
main-website
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git checkout -b main-website

â Now, youâre working in a separate branch where you can build the full website 
without affecting the "Coming Soon" page on 
main
.

ð¹ Step 2: Add the Full Website Code

1ï¸â£ 
Download and extract the full website code from V0.dev.

2ï¸â£ 
Replace the files in your project folder
 with the full website files.

3ï¸â£ 
Make sure 
app/layout.tsx
 and 
app/page.tsx
 are updated to match the new design.

ð¹ Step 3: Test the New Website Locally

1ï¸â£ 
Install dependencies (if needed):

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install

2ï¸â£ 
Run the local dev server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

3ï¸â£ 
Check 
http://localhost:3000

 to make sure the full website loads properly.

ð¹ Step 4: Commit & Push the New Branch

Once everything works:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Started development on the full website"

git push origin main-website

â This pushes the full website 
to GitHub, but on a separate branch
 so it wonât replace the live "Coming Soon" page yet.

ð¹ Step 5: Deploy the Full Website (Later)

Once youâre ready to launch the full website:

1ï¸â£ Merge 
main-website
 into 
main
:

bash

Copy

Edit

git checkout main
git merge main-website
git push origin main

2ï¸â£ Redeploy on 
Vercel
 to update the live site.

ð¥ 
For now, just get the new branch set up and test the full site locally.
 Let me know if you hit any issues! ðð

You said:

alright we are synced so what do I run in terminal again to test locally

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ 
Nice! Now that Proton Drive has synced, letâs test the website locally.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Folder

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

â This ensures youâre inside the correct project directory.

ð¹ Step 2: Install Dependencies (If Needed)

If you haven't installed the latest dependencies after syncing, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install

â This ensures everything is up to date.

ð¹ Step 3: Start the Local Dev Server

Run the following command to start Next.js in development mode:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

â You should see an output like:

arduino

Copy

Edit

â Ready in 

1300

ms
Local: http:

//localhost:3000

ð¹ Step 4: Open the Website in Your Browser

Go to

http://localhost:3000
 in Safari (or Chrome).

Check the site:

â 
Is the background color correct?

â 
Is the SYMBI logo displaying?

â 
Any errors in the browser console?
 (
CMD + Option + C
 in Safari)
