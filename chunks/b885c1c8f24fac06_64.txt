Alright, same 
date-fns
 conflict issue, but now it's breaking the Vercel deployment.
 ðð

We need to 
fix the dependency issue locally, lock in a compatible version, and then push the update to GitHub.

ð¹ Step 1: Manually Fix the 
date-fns
 Dependency Conflict

Since 
react-day-picker@8.10.1

requires 
date-fns
 version 
^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0

, but we have 
date-fns@4.1.0
, we need to 
downgrade 
date-fns
 to a compatible version
.

Run this command locally:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install date-fns@3.6.0 --legacy-peer-deps

â This 
forces 
date-fns
 to use version 3.6.0
, which satisfies both 
react-day-picker
 and the rest of your project.

ð¹ Step 2: Lock in the Correct Dependencies

1ï¸â£ 
After installing the correct version, re-run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

â This ensures 
all dependencies match properly
.

ð¹ Step 3: Test Locally

Now that dependencies are fixed, restart the dev server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

â Open 
http://localhost:3000
 and 
verify that everything still works.

ð¹ Step 4: Push the Fix to GitHub

Once everything works locally, commit and push the update:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed date-fns dependency conflict for Vercel deployment"

git push origin main

â 
This updates GitHub with the correct depe
