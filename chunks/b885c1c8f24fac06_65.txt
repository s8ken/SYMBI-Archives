To find your local path, run this command in your terminal:

bash

Since weâve been working in 
Proton Drive
, your path is likely:

bash

Copy

Edit

/Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

To 
navigate there manually
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Users/sja/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-aitken.stephen@pm.me-folder/symbi-ai-website

â 
Now youâre inside your project folder and can continue fixing the dependency issue!

Nice! 
date-fns@3.6.0
 is now installed, and the dependency conflict is fixed.

Now letâs 
lock in these changes, test locally, push to GitHub, and redeploy to Vercel.

ð¹ Step 1: Verify Everything Works Locally

1ï¸â£ 
Run the dev server to check that everything still works:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

2ï¸â£ Open 

http://localhost:3000

 and check:

â 
Background is correct

â 
Logo is displaying

â 
No console errors (

ð¹ Step 2: Push the Fix to GitHub

If everything looks good, letâs 
commit and push
 the update:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed date-fns dependency conflict for Vercel deployment"

git push origin main

â 
This updates GitHub with the correct dependency version.

ð¹ Step 3: Redeploy on Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click on your 
Symbi project

3ï¸â£ Click 
"Redeploy"
