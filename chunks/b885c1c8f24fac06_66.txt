sure everything works live.

ð¹ Step 1: Redeploy on Vercel

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click on your 
Symbi project

3ï¸â£ Click 
"Redeploy"

4ï¸â£ Wait for the deployment to complete

â This time, 
Vercel should build successfully without the 
date-fns
 dependency error.

ð¹ Step 2: Test the Live Website

Once the deployment finishes:

1ï¸â£ 
Go to your live site URL
 (Vercel will provide the link).

2ï¸â£ 
Check everything:

â Background is correct

â Logo is displaying

â No console errors (
CMD + Option + C
 in Safari)

ð¹ Step 3: (Optional) Fix the GitHub Security Warning

Since GitHub flagged 
1 moderate vulnerability
, you can fix it by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm audit fix --force

â This will 
patch security vulnerabilities in your dependencies
.

If it works fine, 
push the fix to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed GitHub security vulnerability"

git push origin main

Then redeploy on Vercel again if needed.

ð¥ 
Try the Vercel redeploy and let me know if the site is fully live!

Alright, since Vercel is still hitting the 
date-fns
 conflict, letâs force it to use the correct version during deployment.
 ðð

ð¹ Step 1: Manually Set the Correct 
date-fns
 Version in 
package.json

1ï¸â£ Open your 
package.json
 file:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano package.json

2ï¸â£ 
Find the 
dependencies
 section
 and make sure 

date-fns
 is set to 
3.6.0

, like this:

json

Copy

Edit

"dependencies"

:

{

"date-fns"

:

"3.6.0"

,

"react-day-picker"

:

"8.10.1"

,

  ...

}

â 
If 
date-fns
 is still 
4.1.0
, change it to 
3.6.0
.

3ï¸â£ 
Save & exit Nano
:

Press 

CTRL + X

Press 

Y

 (to confirm changes)

Press 

Enter

ð¹ Step 2: Reinstall Dependencies Locally to Match

Now that 
package.json
 is correct, 
delete old dependencies and reinstall cleanly:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf no
