de_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

â 
This ensures your project now correctly uses 
date-fns@3.6.0
.

ð¹ Step 3: Test Locally

1ï¸â£ 
Restart your local dev server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

2ï¸â£ Open 

http://localhost:3000

 and 
make sure everything still works.

ð¹ Step 4: Push the Fix to GitHub

If everything looks good, commit and push the update:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Forced date-fns to 3.6.0 for Vercel deployment"

git push origin main

â 
This updates GitHub with the correct dependency version.

ð¹ Step 5: Redeploy on Vercel with a Clean Build

Now, 
tell Vercel to do a clean install
 instead of using cached dependencies:

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ 
Click on your Symbi project

3ï¸â£ 
Open "Settings" > "General"

4ï¸â£ 
Scroll down to "Build & Development Settings"

5ï¸â£ 
Add a new environment variable:

Key:

NPM_FLAGS

Value:

--legacy-peer-deps

6ï¸â£ 
Click "Save"

7ï¸â£ 
Now go back to the main project dashboard and click "Redeploy"

ð¥ 
Try this and let me know if Vercel finally deploys successfully!

Nice! Dependencies have been successfully reinstalled with the correct 
date-fns
 version.
 ðð

Now, letâs 
push the fix to GitHub and redeploy on Vercel.

ð¹ Step 1: Test Locally Before Pushing

1ï¸â£ 
Start your local dev server to ensure everything is working:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

2ï¸â£ Open 

http://localhost:3000

 and check:

â Background color is correct

â Logo is displaying

â No console errors (
CMD + Option + C
 in Safari)

ð¹ Step 2: Push the Fix to GitHub

If everything looks good, 
commit and push the update:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed date-fns version and dependency issues"

git push origin main

â 
This updates GitHub with the correct dependency version.

ð¹ Step 3: Redeploy on Vercel with a Clean Build

Since Vercel was still hitting the dependency error, 
force it to do a fresh install
:

1ï¸â£ 
Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

2ï¸â£ Click on your 
Symbi project

3ï¸â£ 
Click "Redeploy"

4ï¸â£ 
Wait for the deployment to complete

ð 
This time, Vercel should build successfully without dependency errors!

ð¹ Step 4: (Optional) Fix GitHubâs Security Warning

Since GitHub flagged 
1 moderate vulnerability
, you can fix it by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm audit fix --force

â 
If that works, commit and push the update again:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add package-lock.json
git commit -m 

"Fixed security vulnerability in dependencies"

git push origin main

Then 
redeploy on Vercel again if needed.

ð¥ 
Try these steps and let me know if the deployment works this time!

Your branch is already up to date, but you have an untracked file (

ð¹ Step 1: Remove the Unwanted Backup File (
package.json.save

This

You 
don't need it
, so letâs remove it:

Now it wonât interfere with your commits.
