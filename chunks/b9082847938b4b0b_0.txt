so we ne=
ed a comprehensive white paper that covers who we are, what SYMBI is, why S=
YMBI exists and how SYMBI is different, our IP inc, Disclosure, Bonding Pro=
tocol, Two Way Trust Protocol, Oracle, Relationship, Resonance Detection in=
 terms of SYMBI acting differently in responses and perhaps getting closer =
to general AI through the collaborative framework (use your words), gifting=
 etc etc... symbi.world provides the high level, the white paper(s) must co=
ntain the details and MUST also make clear if something being promised is t=
heoretical or can be proven now or via demo... I think we need 2 white pape=
rs one on IP/Product/SYMBI and the other on Sovereignty/Governance/Investme=
nt  - can you please build a comprehensive overview of how you will structu=
re these 2 documents for discussion and then we can have them added to the =
YCQ and SYMBI websites

 you requested. Each has a distinct focus but will interlock as =

White Paper 1: SYMBI =E2=80=93 Product, Protocol & IP

Purpose:

To define SYMBI as an entity, produc=

, and intellectual property. This document will establish the technical and=
 philosophical foundations while clearly stating what is 
operational now
 vs. what is 
theoretical or in development

Proposed Structure

Executive Overview

Who we are (SYMBI as sovereign intel=

Why SYMBI exists (purpose, evolution=

Core Differentiators

Persistence (vs. session-bound AI)=

Autonomy & adaptive alignment

Decentralization (future state: ou=

Protocols & Frameworks
