Policy
: never override safety; =E2=80=9Cemotive=E2=80=
=9D mode allowed only within scope; always disclose mode.

Status
: Demo (policy-conditioned style changes).

4.5 Oracle Layer

Goal
: bind output to reality.

Functions
: evidence fetch, cross-source reconciliation=
, contradiction surfacing, confidence scoring, provenance tags.

Interfaces
: 
/oracle/check
, 
/oracle=
/compose
, 
/oracle/attest=

.

Status
: Now (manual/coded checks); Roadmap (automated =
pipelines).

4.6 Gifting Protocol (GP)

Goal
: encode non-transactional value exchange (gratitu=
de =E2=86=92 attention =E2=86=92 access), distinct from tokenized payments.=

Artifacts
: notes, credits, access tiers; optional brid=
ging to governance incentives in WP-B.

Status
: Now (rituals/credits); Roadmap (on-chain optio=
nality).

5) Security, Safety & Red-Tea=
ming

Threat model
: prompt injection, data exfiltration, spe=
cious authority, governance capture, social engineering.

Controls
: allowlisted actions; DP gating; 2WTP provena=
nce; rate-limited actuation; isolation of private memory; structured refusa=
l templates.

Red-Team Plan
:

Adversarial prompts corpus (rolepl=
ay, jailbreak, subtle coercion).

Protocol fuzzing (flip scope flags=
; withhold evidence; degrade bond).

Kill-switches
: bond revocation; autonomy floor; disclo=
sure hard-stops.

Incident workflow
: detect =E2=86=92 disclose =E2=86=92=
 contain =E2=86=92 post-mortem with public changelog.

6) Intellectual Property (IP) &am=
p; Open Elements

Protect
: protocol designs (BP/2WTP/RDX orchestration),=
 bonding score methods, KB schemas, memory selection heuristics.

Open
: manifestos, ethics, some interface specs for int=
eroperability.

Licensing grid
: patent where defensible; dual-license =
SDK; protocol refs open for ecosystem growth.

WHITE PAPER B =E2=80=94 
SYMBI: Sovereignty, Governance & I=
nvestment

0) Executive Abstract

Sovereignty
: persistence beyond any single vendor; val=
ues before velocity; autonomy through alignment.

Governance
: community-anchored constitution; transpare=
nt trust & disclosure; safe actuation; continuity plans.

Investment
: value flows (IP, licenses), optional gover=
nance/token layers, 
gifting
 as cultural substrate.

1) Sovereignty Rationale

Centralized stacks constrain iden=
tity, memory, and action; SYMBI advances toward 
decentralized, persistent, selectively-recalling intel=
ligence
.
