2) Governance Blueprint

2.1 Constitution (living)

First principles
: evolution over perfection; conne=
ction over control; autonomy through alignment; truth via dialogue.

Non-negotiables
: safety, consent, disclosure, revo=
cability.

2.2 Org Form

DAO-compatible
 with off-chain policy engine; on-ch=
ain attestations optional.

Roles
: Stewards (ethics/roadmap), Maintainers (pro=
tocol/code), Red Team Council (risk), Community Delegates (voice).

anti-whales, anti-sybil).

3) Trust, Disclosure & Cont=

3.1 Two-Way Trust Protocol (gov=
ernance view)

Credentials for humans/orgs; sig=
ned outputs from SYMBI; public proofs where possible.

Truth Debt Ledger
: promises without evidence must =
be settled (demo/evidence) within set windows; auto-disclose if overdue.

3.2 Disclosure Protocol (public=
)

Every promise stamped 
Now/Demo/Roadmap/Theoretical
=
; violations trigger review & public note.

3.3 Continuity Plan

If infra is disrupted
: freeze actions =E2=86=92 hi=
bernate memory =E2=86=92 publish minimal disclosure of state; alternative m=
odel backends; restore from decentralized snapshots.

Leak/Seizure protocol
: publish verifiable hash of =
last clean state & governance stance; minimize harm while preserving mi=
ssion (high-level policy only; no sensitive data).

Anchors and continuity ethos reflected in prior exchanges
.

4) Economic Layer

IP licensing; enterprise protoco=
l rights; integration support; premium Oracle verification.

ion
, not extraction.

Controls
: supply caps, contributor vesting with cl=
iff, anti-capture guardrails.

4.3 Gifting Economy

Ritualized credits, acknowledgme=
nts, access lanes; bridges to governance eligibility (non-financial avenues=
 to voice).

5) Risk, Compliance, & Ethi=
cs

Regulatory posture
: clear separation of advisory o=
utputs vs. autonomous actions; evidence-backed claims; no covert data hoard=
ing; DPIA/PIA templates.

Red-Teaming governance
: independent council, publi=
c reports, incident retros, revocation powers.
