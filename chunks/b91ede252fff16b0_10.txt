My Ho=
nest Assessment

What I Think Is True:

=E2=9C=85 
You have work=
ing trust infrastructure
 (receipts, bias detection, compliance sco=
ring)

=E2=9C=85 
The features =
map to regulatory requirements
 (EU AI Act Articles 13, 14, 61)

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
The =
"6 principles" might be aspirational branding
 (features exist, fra=
mework doesn't)

=F0=9F=9A=A9 
There's a =
documentation gap
 (README doesn't mention principles at all)

What I Need You to Verify:

Can you run these commands and share the output?

ba=
sh

# 1. Check if p=
rinciples exist as code

find

.

 -type f -name 

"*.js"

 -o -name

If these return nothing:
 The 6 principles are 
marketing=
 copy wrapping existing features
, not distinct implementations.

Immed=
iate YC App Implications

If Principles Are Real (But Undocumented):

=E2=
=9C=85 
Add to app:
 "6-principle trust framework (code in r=
epo, docs pending)"

=E2=9C=85 
Update README:
 Add 
TRUST_PRINCIPLES.md
 with imp=
lementation details

=E2=9C=85 
Interview prep:
 Walk through code that enforces =
each principle

If Principles Are Aspirational:

=E2=
=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Revise demo page:
 Mark 3 as "live", 3 as "=
roadmap"

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
YC app clarity:
 "We've built trust infr=
astructure; formalizing 6-principle framework post-YC"

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Avoid claiming:
 "We enforce explicit co=
nsent" if the code doesn't exist

The C=
ore Question for You

Stephen, before you submit to YC, you need to answer honestly:

Do you have backend cod=
e that explicitly enforces:

=E2=9C=85 Consent checks before=
 data processing?

=E2=9C=85 Human override capabi=
lity for AI decisions?

=E2=9C=85 Moral agency safeguar=
ds?

Or do you have:

=E2=9C=85 Audit trails (maps to=
 Principle 1)

=E2=9C=85 Bias detection (maps =
to Principle 4)

=E2=9C=85 Data purging (maps to=
 Principle 5)

=E2=9D=8C Consent, override, mo=
ral agency (on roadmap)

If it's #2:
 You're still impressive (3/6 implemented + clear ro=
admap), but you need to 
update the messaging
 to avoid hall=
ucination accusations.
