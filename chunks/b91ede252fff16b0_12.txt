**YC implication:** You can literally **screen-share this code=

**Why this matters for YC:**

- It's **quantifiable** (not philosophical hand-waving)

- It's **auditable** (anyone can verify the math)

- It's **patent-worthy** (you filed provisional in AU, right?)

**Competitive moat:** No competitor has a weighted trust frame=
work. They have logs or dashboards =E2=80=94 you have **enforceable complia=
nce math**.

### **3. The Gaps Are Manageable**

| Gap | Status | Fix Timeline | Impact |

|---|---|---|---|

| DID signatures on principles | Backend ready, not wired | **=
2 hours** | Medium |

| Consent UI | Backend logic done, no frontend | **8 hours** |=
 Medium |

| Override button | Backend logic done, no frontend | **4 hour=
s** | Medium |

| W3C VC export | Not implemented | **4 hours** | Low |

**Total to "fill gaps":** ~18 hours of work =20

**Time until YC deadline:** ~45 hours =20

**Verdict:** =E2=9C=85 **You could ship all of this before sub=
mission if you wanted**

But you don't need to. Just be honest about backend vs. fronte=
