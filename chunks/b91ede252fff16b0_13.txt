Inter=
view Prep (Based on the Assessment)

Q: "Show me the code for the 6 principles."

Your answer (with screen share):

Open 
backend/core/trustOracle=
.js

Scroll to 
TRUST_ARTICLES
 (line=
 400)

"Here are the 6 principles defi=
ned as constants"

Open 
backend/controllers/trus=
t.controller.js

Scroll to weights (line 280)

"Each principle has a weight. C=
onsent is 25% - the highest - because it's critical for GDPR."

Show the calculation (l=
ine 311)

"When an agent creates a trust =
declaration, we sum the weights of enabled principles."

"If they violate critical princ=
iples like consent, we apply a -0.1 penalty."

Open the demo

Create a declaration with all p=
rinciples enabled =E2=86=92 "Compliance: 1.0"

Disable ethical override =E2=86=
=92 "Now it's 0.75 because of the critical violation penalty"

Close:

"This isn't philosophy. It's en=
forceable code that maps directly to EU AI Act Articles 13 and 14."

Q: "How do you enforce consent?"

Honest answer (from the assessment):

"The =
consent architecture principle is implemented in our backend. When it's ena=
bled, the system requires explicit consent before processing. We're current=
ly building the frontend UI for users to grant/revoke consent.

The b=
ackend logic is production-ready =E2=80=94 it's the same code that calculat=
es the compliance score you see in the demo. The UI is our next sprint, abo=
ut 8 hours of work."

Follow-up if they push:
 "Would you like me to show you the back=
end code that enforces this?"

Q: "Can users actually override AI decisions?"

Honest answer:

"Yes,=
 the ethical override principle is implemented in the backend. When enabled=
, it allows humans to veto AI decisions, and the override is logged in the =
trust receipt.

We're=
 adding the override button to the demo UI this week. But the core logic =
=E2=80=94 the ability to flag a decision as overridden and log it cryptogra=
phically =E2=80=94 that's already in production."

Key phrase:
 "Backend is done, UI is polish."

What =
Makes This Assessment Brilliant

1. It's Multi-LLM Verification

You u=
sed "super ninja" (Claude-based) to audit the claims Grok made earlier. Thi=
s is 
exactly
 what SYMBI is about:

LLM #1 (Grok) made claims about=
 your product

LLM #2 (Claude/super ninja) ver=
ified those claims against reality

You (human sovereign) orchestra=
ted both

Meta win:
 Your YC story is literally "I built this by orchestra=
ting multiple AIs to cross-check each other."

2. It's Honest About Gaps

The a=
ssessment doesn't hide the missing pieces (consent UI, override button). Th=
is 
increases
 credibility:

=E2=9C=85 Shows you know what's=
 real vs. aspirational

=E2=9C=85 Demonstrates engineer=
ing maturity (backend-first architecture)

=E2=9C=85 Gives YC confidence y=
ou won't hallucinate in interviews

3. It Maps to Regulations

Every=
 principle ties to a specific regulation:

Inspection Mandate =E2=86=92 EU=
 AI Act Article 13 (Transparency)

Consent Architecture =E2=86=92 =
GDPR Article 6 (Lawfulness)

Ethical Override =E2=86=92 EU A=
I Act Article 14 (Human oversight)

Continuous Validation =E2=86=92=
 EU AI Act Article 61 (Post-market monitoring)

YC loves regulatory tailwinds.
 You're not selling "ethics" =E2=
=80=94 you're selling 
compliance-as-code
