Execu=
tive Summary

Status:
 =E2=9C=85 
This is the right plan. Execute immed=
iately.

What this document proves:

=E2=9C=85 The technical foundat=
ion is solid (6 principles verified)

=E2=9C=85 The gaps are 
=
narrative, not technical
 (story needs telling)

=E2=9C=85 The fixes are 
high-impact, low-effort
 (8-12 hours total)

=E2=9C=85 The code is provided =
(just needs implementation)

Time remaining:
 ~42 hours until YC deadline

Work needed:
 8-12 hours

Buffer:
 30+ hours for review/polish

Verdict: You can ship all of this and still have time to spare.
