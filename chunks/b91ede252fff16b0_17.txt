What =
I Can Help With Right Now

submission"

I'll check for consistency with=
 website

Criti=

DO:

ctly (it's tested)

Test on mobile after each secti=
on

Commit after each working secti=
on

Deploy to preview URL before me=
rging to main

Update YC app AFTER website is =
live

=E2=
=9D=8C 
DON'T:

Rewrite the sections from scrat=
ch (waste of time)

Skip mobile testing (YC partner=
s use phones)

Deploy without local testing fi=
rst

Update YC app before website is=
 live (broken links =3D bad)

Botto=

Want me to:

Walk you through the first sect=
ion live (Hero CTAs)?

Generate the exact React compon=
ent for a specific section?

Review your repo structure to s=
uggest best file organization?

Draft commit messages for each =
phase?

Just say:
 "Start with [X]" and I'll guide you through it step-b=
