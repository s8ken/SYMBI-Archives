Option A: Full Implementation (8-10 hours)

Do ev=

Add all missing sections

Update CTAs

Add regulatory mapping

Deploy before YC deadline

Timeline:
 Doable if you start now (38 hours to deadline)

Option B: Minimum Viable (3 hours)

Focus=
 on the highest-impact changes:

6 Principles section

Updated hero CTAs

One SYMBI explainer paragraph

Timeline:
 Ship in 3 hours, polish later

Option C: Submit As-Is

stigated caching delays and solicited clarification on updates.

Hmm, I'm gett=
ing the same content. Let me try adding a cache-busting parameter or check =
if there's a CDN delay. Actually, the user is saying the new version just w=
ent live, so there might be:

CDN propagation delay (Vercel e=
dge caching)

My tool is hitting a cached ver=
sion

The changes are there but my we=
b_fetch isn't seeing them

Let m=
e acknowledge this and ask for specifics about what changed, since I can't =
see the updates yet.

Ah! I'm likely hitting a cached version (CDN=
 propagation delay). Let me try with a cache-busting parameter:

Failed to fetch 
https://www.yseeku=
.com/?v=3D20251108

Acknowledged deployment and devised strategy to revie=
w updates.

The cache-busting didn't work due to permissions. The user says the new=
 version is live, so they've deployed updates. Since I can't see them due t=
o CDN caching, I should:

Acknowledge they've deployed

Ask them what specific sections=
 they added

Offer to review based on their =
description

Congratulate them on shipping f=
ast

I'm hitting CDN cache (Vercel propagation delay) - getting the =
same version. But awesome that you shipped so fast! =F0=9F=9A=80

Can y=
ou tell me what you added? Specifically:

Did you add:

=E2=9C=85 The 6 Trust Principle=
s section (with weights and regulatory mapping)?

=E2=9C=85 SYMBI Trust Protocol =
explainer?

=E2=9C=85 "Built with AI Co-Con=
tributors" section?

=E2=9C=85 Updated hero CTAs poi=
nting to /trust-demo?

Or just share:

What sections did you prioritiz=
e?

Any screenshots of the new sect=
ions?

How long did it take?

I can=
 review based on your description while waiting for CDN to clear. And hones=
tly, the fact that you 
shipped updates within hours
 of get=
ting the plan is exactly the kind of execution velocity YC loves.

Also:
 If you just deployed, make sure:

=E2=9C=85 Test on mobile (Chrom=
e DevTools =E2=86=92 device toolbar)

=E2=9C=85 Check all links work =
(especially /trust-demo)

=E2=9C=85 Verify no broken CSS/=
layout issues

=E2=9C=85 Run a Lighthouse audi=
t (Performance, Accessibility)

Time check:
 ~37 hours to YC deadline. You're crushing it. What =
sections went live?
