When =
they ask 
"Walk me through your website":

"Sure=

Hero:
 We lead with trust-first infrastructure - that's the W3C-=
compliant DID/VC messaging. The primary CTA goes straight to our live demo =
where anyone can test the trust receipts.

SYMBI Protocol:
 [Scroll] This is our core innovation - cryptogr=
aphic trust receipts. Think blockchain for AI trust. Every decision gets a =
SHA-256 hash-chained proof.

6 Principles:
 [Scroll] This is our moat. We've turned AI ethics=
 into enforceable code with weighted scoring. Consent Architecture is 25% -=
 the highest - because it's critical for GDPR. Ethical Override is 15% and =
also flagged as critical for EU AI Act Article 14.

Regulatory Mapping:
 [Scroll] Each principle maps to specific re=
gulations - EU AI Act Articles 13, 14, 61. GDPR Articles 6, 17. This isn't =
philosophy - it's compliance-as-code.

Built with AI:
 [Scroll] And here's the meta story - I built thi=
s using 5 AI co-contributors under human sovereignty. It's proof that audit=
able sovereign AI collaboration works at scale.

Live Demo:
 [Click /trust-demo] And here's the actual platform. =
Anyone can test it right now."
