YC/investor implications

Let m=
e break down each DID method and assess the overall strategy.

Analysis: SYMBI's Multi-Method =
DID Strategy

Execu=
tive Summary

This =
is 
strategically brilliant but execution-risky
. Supporting=
 4 DID methods shows deep W3C compliance understanding and positions SYMBI =
as the "Switzerland of enterprise identity" =E2=80=94 but only if you can a=
ctually deliver on all four. Let me break down what's real, what's aspirati=
onal, and what matters for YC.

Techn=
ical Accuracy Assessment

=
=E2=9C=85 
did:web
 =E2=80=94 Enterprise Gold Standard

Status:
 Most enterprise-ready, easiest to implement

Strengths:

DNS-based =3D enterprises alrea=
dy understand it

No blockchain needed =3D lower =
barrier to adoption

W3C spec is mature and stable

Microsoft, IBM, Oracle all use =
this

Implementation Reality Check:

ty=
pescript

// =
This is ~50 lines of code to implement

async

function

resolveDIDWeb

(

did

:

string

)

{

// did:web:example.com:user:alice

// =E2=86=92 HTTPS GET https://examp=

return

}

For YCQ Sonate:
 This should be your 
primary method
 for enterprise pilots. Banks/healthcare won't touch blockchain DIDs.

YC Angle:
 "We support did:web so enterprises can self-host iden=
tity without our infrastructure."

=
=E2=9C=85 
did:key
 =E2=80=94 Cryptographic Purity

Status:
 Simplest to implement, limited utility

Strengths:

No network calls =3D works offl=
ine

Self-contained =3D no registry =
needed

Perfect for ephemeral/test iden=
tities

Limitations:

Can't be updated
 (key rotation impossible)

Can't be revoked
 (if private key leaks, identity is burned)

Not suitable for long-lived ent=
erprise identities

Implementation Reality:

ty=
pescript

// =
This is ~30 lines

async

function

resolveDIDKey

(

did

:

string

)

{

// did:key:z6Mk... is just a multiba=
se-encoded public key

// No network call - the DID IS the =
key

const

 publicKey 

=3D

multibaseToKey

(

did

.

split

(

':'

)

[

2

]

)

return

generateDIDDocument

(

publicKey

)

}

For YCQ Sonate:
 Use this for 
testing
 and 
one-time audit receipts
 (e.g., "this AI decision was signed by =
did:key:z6Mk...")

YC Angle:
 "did:key enables zero-infrastructure trust receipts =
=E2=80=94 no servers, no blockchain."

=
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
did:ethr
 =E2=80=94 Ethereum Reality Che=
ck

Status:
 Well-specified, but gas costs kill enterprise adoption

Strengths:

Decentralized registry (ERC-105=
6 standard)

Can update/revoke identities on=
-chain

Large ecosystem (MetaMask, uPor=
t, etc.)

Critical Problems:

Issue

Impact

Workaround

Gas costs

$5-50 per DID operation

Use L2s (Polygon, Arbitrum)

Latency

12-15 sec block times

Cache resolutions

Ethereum dependency

Mainnet outages =3D no auth

Fallback to did:web

Implementation Reality:

ty=
pescript

Requires smart contract interaction

For YCQ Sonate:
 Only support this if you have 
crypto-na=
tive pilots
 (DAOs, DeFi protocols). Otherwise, it's a distraction.=

YC Angle:
 "did:ethr for Web3 pilots =E2=80=94 but we default to=
 did:web for traditional enterprise."
