Critical Problems:

Issue

Reality

Risk

Node availability

ION public nodes are flaky

Your resolution fails if Microsoft's nodes are down

Complexity

Requires running a Bitcoin + IPFS + Sidet=
ree node

Not "lightweight"

Adoption

Mostly Microsoft pilots

Limited ecosystem

Spec stability

Still evolving (last maj=
or change: Q2 2024)

Breaking changes possible

For YCQ Sonate:

Don't implement this yet.
 It's=
 a distraction unless:

You have a Microsoft partnershi=
p

A pilot specifically requests B=
itcoin-anchored identity

You're building for 10K+ DID/se=
c scale (you're not)

YC Red Flag:
 Saying you support did:ion without running ION inf=
rastructure is a hallucination. Don't claim this unless it's live.

Strat=
egic Assessment

What This Multi-Method Strategy Signals:

=E2=
=9C=85 
Strengths:

Standards compliance
 =E2=80=94 Shows you understand W3C DID specs deeply

Flexibility
 =
=E2=80=94 Lets enterprises choose (DNS vs. blockchain vs. hybrid)

Future-proof
 =
=E2=80=94 Not locked into one identity paradigm

Competitive moat
 =E2=80=94 Most "AI trust" platforms ignore identity layer entirely

=E2=
=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F 
Risks:

Scope creep
 =
=E2=80=94 Supporting 4 methods =3D 4=C3=97 maintenance burden

Uneven maturity
 =E2=80=94 did:web is easy, did:ion is a 6-month project

Investor confusion
 =E2=80=94 "Why do I need 4 identity systems?"

Hallucination risk
 =E2=80=94 Claiming support before implementation =3D credibility loss

Reality check:
 Let me assess what you likely have vs. what's as=
pirational.

DID Method

Likely Implementation Status

Confidence

did:web

=E2=9C=85 Implemented (it's just HTTPS)

95%

did:key

=E2=9C=85 Implemented (=
it's just multibase)

90%

did=
:ethr

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Partial (connects to publi=
c registry?)

60%

did:ion

=E2=9D=8C Not implemented (requires ION node)

10%

Why this matters for YC:

If YC asks "show me did:ion res=
olution" and you don't have it =E2=86=92 credibility hit

Better to say: "We support did:=
web and did:key (proven), with did:ethr on roadmap"

Recom=
mendations by Scenario

For YC Application (Due Nov 10):

Do:

Claim did:web + did:key=

 (these are table stakes and easy to demo)

Mention did:ethr as "in=
 pilots"
 (if you have it working)

Skip did:ion entirely
 (unless you literally have it running)

Say:

"YCQ =
Sonate supports W3C-compliant DIDs (did:web for enterprises, did:key for ep=
hemeral trust receipts). We're adding did:ethr for Web3 pilots in Q1 2026."=

Don't say:

"We s=
upport 4 DID methods" (unless all 4 are demonstrable in your live demo)

For Enterprise Pilots:

Enterprise Type

Recommended DID

Why

Banks, Healthcare

d=
id:web

They control DNS, no blockchain

Crypto/Web3

did:ethr

Alig=
ns with their infrastructure

Government

did:web or did:ion

Depends on sovereign=
 requirements

Startups/DAOs

did:key or did:ethr

Low overhead

Pitch:
 "We meet you where you are =E2=80=94 your DNS, your bloc=
kchain, or pure crypto."

For Technical Roadmap:

Phase 1 (Now =E2=86=92 YC):

=E2=9C=85 did:web (production)

=E2=9C=85 did:key (production)

Phase 2 (Post-YC, Q1 2026):

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F did:ethr on =
L2 (Polygon)

Document: "Why we chose did:web=
 as default"

Phase 3 (If Microsoft partnership or $10M+ raise):

=E2=9D=8C did:ion (requires ded=
icated infra team)
