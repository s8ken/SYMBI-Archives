Question:
 "Walk me through DID resolution in your live demo."

Good answer:

"In o=
ur YCQ Sonate demo, when an enterprise creates an audit trail, we generate =
a did:web identifier hosted on their domain. Here's a live example: [screen=
 share =E2=86=92 show did.json resolution]. For ephemeral receipts, we use =
did:key =E2=80=94 no network call, just cryptographic proof."

Bad answer:

"We s=
upport did:web, did:key, did:ethr, and did:ion for maximum flexibility."

[Interviewer:] "Show me did:ion resolution."

[You:] "Uh, that's on the roadmap..."

Red flag avoided:
 Only claim what you can demo in 30 seconds.

What's Real:

The 
architecture
 is sound (multi-method DID support =3D good design)

did:web + did:key
 are likely implemented (easy wins)

The 
enterprise value
 is clear (let customers choose identity backend)

What's Risky:

did:ethr
 is ha=
lf-built (connects to public registry but no custom deployment?)

did:ion
 is pro=
bably vaporware (unless you're running ION nodes)

Scope creep
 =
=E2=80=94 4 methods =3D 4=C3=97 attack surface for YC questions

What to Do:

For YC app:
 Le=
ad with did:web (enterprise) + did:key (receipts)

For demo:
 Show=
 did:web resolution (fetch a .well-known/did.json from your domain)

For roadmap:
 "=
Adding did:ethr for Web3 pilots, did:ion if Microsoft partnership emerges"

Final take:
 This is 
good architecture, risky messaging
. Deliver on 2 methods perfectly rather than 4 methods poorly.
