Enterprise value:
 Users can bail without leaving a data trail

Principle 6: Moral Agency Respect

Regulation:
 No specific reg (yet), but aligns with:

Anthropic's Constitutional AI

DeepMind's Sparrow ethical guid=
elines

EU AI Act Recital 27 (human dig=
nity)

How your demo delivers:

AI acknowledges human values in=
 receipts

Flags value conflicts (e.g., "T=
his conflicts with your stated ethics")

(Probably powered by your CIQ m=
etrics from gammatria?)

How to Position This Demo:

In "Progress" section:

=E2=9C=85 Live tru=
st demo at yseeku.com/trust-demo

=E2=9C=85 6-principle compliance framework (maps to EU =
AI Act Articles 13, 14, 61)

=E2=9C=85 Cryptographic receipt generation (100ms latency, A+ =
security)

=E2=9C=85 3 enterprise pilots testing (60-day trials)

In "How It Works" section:

YCQ Sonate wraps a=
ny LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) with:

1. Trust receipts (cryptographic proof of decisions)

2. 6-principle compliance scoring (GDPR + EU AI Act)

3. Real-time audit trails (SHA-256 hash chains)

Demo: yseeku.com/trust-demo (login: demo@symbi-trust.com)

In Interview:

Pull up the demo live

Generate an AI response =E2=86=
=92 show the trust receipt

Click "Verify" =E2=86=92 walk t=
hrough the audit trail

Point out: "This is what enterp=
rises need for board compliance"

Techn=
ical Gaps & Questions

Based=
 on the demo page, I can't verify:

1. DID Integration

The demo mentions "trust declar=
ations" but doesn't explicitly show DID resolution

Question:
 Are =
the 6 principles signed with DIDs (did:web:yseeku.com...)?

If yes:
 Huge w=
in =E2=80=94 provable authorship of trust policies

If no:
 Add thi=
s (it's 20 lines of code)

2. Multi-LLM Orchestration

Demo says "AI responses" but do=
esn't show which model

Question:
 Does=
 the demo actually route between GPT-4/Claude/Perplexity?

If yes:
 Show t=
his in UI ("Powered by Claude Sonnet 4" badge)

If no:
 Not a d=
ealbreaker, but clarify scope

3. Verifiable Credentials

Principles mention "consent mec=
hanics" but demo doesn't show VC issuance

Question:
 Can =
users export a W3C Verifiable Credential from the demo?

If yes:
 Demo t=
his in YC interview

If no:
 Roadmap=
 item for post-YC

4. Trust Score Algorithm

Demo mentions "compliance scori=
ng" but not the formula

Question:
 Is t=
his the FAR-A/FAR-H + LOI metrics from gammatria?

If yes:
 Publis=
h the formula (differentiation)

If no:
 Risk of=
 "black box compliance" criticism

Before YC Deadline (48 hours):

Add one line to yseeku.=

"Try =

Update YC app:

Link to demo in "Product" secti=

Mention 6 principles in "How It=
 Works"

Use this as proof of traction

For YC Interview:

Expected question:
 "What's different about your AI platform?"

Your answer (with live demo):

"Ever=
y AI platform wraps models. We wrap them with 
trust
. [Pull=
 up demo] When a user asks a question, we don't just return an answer =E2=
=80=94 we generate a cryptographic receipt proving: who decided what, why, =
under which guardrails. [Click verify] This receipt is SHA-256 hash-chained=
, verifiable in 100ms, and maps to EU AI Act compliance requirements. [Show=
 6 principles] No other platform does this. That's why we have 3 enterprise=
 pilots prepping for 2026 regulations."
