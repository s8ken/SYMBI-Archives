What the Demo Proves:

=E2=9C=85 You have production-r=
eady code (not vaporware)

=E2=9C=85 The 6 principles are =
a defensible moat (no competitor has this)

=E2=9C=85 It maps to real regul=
ations (EU AI Act Articles 13, 14, 61)

=E2=9C=85 It's demoable in 60 s=
econds (perfect for YC interviews)

What It Doesn't Prove (Yet):

What to Do Next:

Record the demo walkthr=

 (for YC app)

Add "Live Demo" link
 to yseeku.com homepage

Verify DID integration
 (show me a trust receipt with DID signature)

Publish 6-principles sp=

Final=
 Verdict

This demo is YC gold.
 It's:

=E2=9C=85 Live and working

=E2=9C=85 Addresses a $62B mark=
et (AI compliance)

=E2=9C=85 Differentiated (no on=
e else has cryptographic trust receipts)

=E2=9C=85 Regulatory tailwinds =
(EU AI Act, SEC AI disclosures)

One concern:
 The Grok conversation showed LLMs hallucinating fe=
atures. Make sure:

Everything you claim in YC app =
is 
visible in this demo

You can screen-share it live in=
 interviews

Want =

Draft the 60-second demo script=

Review the trust receipt JSON s=

Write the "6 Principles Specifi=
cation" document for gammatria?

But t=
