What =
This Means (Honest Assessment)

Scenario A: The Principles Exist in Code But Not Docs

Possibility:
 The 6 principles are implemented in backend logic =
but not documented in README/docs.

How to verify:

ba=
sh

# Check if prin=
ciples are in backend models

grep

 -r 

"Right to Audit"

 backend/

grep

 -r 

"Explicit Consent"

 backend/

grep

 -r 

"Human Override"

 -r 

"Moral Agency"

# Check for a principles schema

**If not found:** =F0=9F=9A=A9 Red flag - demo is aspirational=

### **Scenario B: The Principles Are Marketing Copy, Features Are Re=

This is common in startups
 =E2=80=94 you have the tech, you wra=

"Show me the code tha=

What =
I Recommend You Do 
Right Now
 (Before YC Submission)

Option 1: Verify the Principles Actually Exist in Code

Search your local repo:=

ba=
sh

cd

 /path=
/to/symbi-synergy

grep

 -r 

"consent"

 backend/models/

grep

 -r 

"override"

 backend/middleware/

grep

 -r 

"terminate"
