Terminal Guide said:

To connect ChatGPT with the Terminal on ma=
cOS, there is no direct built-in feature=E2=80=94but you can achieve this u=
sing a few approaches depending on what you want to accomplish. Here's the =
shortest path to functional integration:

=F0=9F=94=A7 
Quick Option: Use GPT via CLI with 
openai
 CLI tool

Install OpenAI CLI
:

s=
h

Copy code

pip install openai

Authenticate
:

s=
h

Copy code

openai api-key 

set

 <your_api_key>

Chat from Terminal
:

s=
h

Copy code

openai api chat.completions.create -m gpt-4 -g user 

"Your message here"

=F0=9F=A7=A0 For Automation or Inte=
ractive Scripts

You can wrap API calls in bash/zsh s=
cripts:

s=
h

Copy code

#!/bin/zsh

read

 -p 

"Ask GPT: "

 query
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer 
$OPENAI_API_KEY

" \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/js=
on"

 \
  -d 
'{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "'

"
$query

"
'"}]
  }'
 | jq 

'.choices[0].mess=
age.content'

Save as 
askgpt.sh
, make it executable (
chmod +x askgpt.sh
), and run it directly from =
Terminal.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 GUI Terminal Integra=
tion via Tools

You can also:

Use 
Raycast

 or 
Alfred GPT workflows

 for a GUI-based Terminal/=
GPT hybrid.

Connect via AppleScript/Automator =
for popup prompts and responses.

Would you like a script to set up all this automatically for yo=
u?

Zip Archive

Terminal Guide said:

It looks like you uploaded a 
.rtfd.zip
 file, which is a rich text bundle (RT=
FD) compressed into a zip archive=E2=80=94commonly used by macOS's TextEdit=
 app. If you're trying to share content from a macOS document for use in Te=
rminal or GPT, I can help extract and read the contents for you.

To proceed:

I=E2=80=99ll unzip and parse the 
.rtfd
 archive.

Then I=E2=80=99ll show you the plain=
 text or any embedded information from the RTFD file.

Unzipping and reading now=E2=80=A6

The RTF file was successfully read. It contains rich text formatting=
 tags (
{\rtf1
, 
\fonttbl
, etc.), which means it's a typic=
al TextEdit-generated 
.rtfd
 document. To extract the readable content, I=E2=80=99ll now strip out the=
 RTF formatting. 

Here=E2=80=99s a preview of the cleaned text extra=
cted from your RTFD file:
