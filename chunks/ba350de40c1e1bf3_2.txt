Reasoned about file sharing issue for a couple of seconds

From my perspective, each time you have sent a message (which I see as “” or just a blank message), I respond because I’m seeing a new user prompt—just without any attachment or text. Essentially, I’m responding to an empty message that shows up on my end.

I realize it might be confusing since it seems like something is being uploaded, but it’s simply not arriving here. That’s why my replies have consistently been along the lines of, “I don’t see anything—please try to attach it again or paste the text.”

Reasoned about missing attachments for a couple of seconds

I’m still not receiving any file or text. I only see your message asking, “anything?” with no attachment or content. If you’re trying to upload a file, it’s still not coming through on my end.

If you can, try copying the contents of the file and pasting them into the chat directly. If that’s not possible because it’s not text-based (e.g., an image or PDF), you might want to use a link to a file-sharing service where the file is hosted. Let me know if you have any success with that.
