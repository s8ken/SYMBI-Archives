Suggestion:

Introduce

Use 
"strict": true

Consider adding

 to detect unused exports.

=F0=9F=94=B9 c. Testing coverage =
improvement

The README claims 
95% tests passing
, but there=E2=80=

Fix:
 Add Jest coverage report:

bash

Copy code

jest --coverage && npx codecov

and connect to Codecov.io for publ=
ic reporting.

 suggests an npm release flow, but

 likely lacks:

 whitelist,

There=E2=80=99s a wealth of Markdo=

To reduce cognitive overhead for new contributors:

Add 
/docs/overview.md
 linking to core docs (EXECUTIVE_SUMM=

Create a

Likely regressions:

Submodules not initialized

Tests/CI pipeline missing

TypeScript definitions drifting fr=
om codebase

Highest-impact fixes:

Add GitHub Actions CI with build +=
 tests

Clean up submodules and confirm 
npm publish
 flow

Introduce workspace tooling (Nx/Tu=
rborepo)

Document environment and versionin=
g strategy

Would you like me to 
scan the 
package.json
 and 
tsconfig.json
 file=
s
 from the repo next? That would allow pinpointing configuration m=
ismatches (e.g. missing scripts, compiler flags, or dependency drift).

=F0=9F=A7=A9 
Potential Bugs / Regressions

1. 
Submodule Conflicts or Staleness

You have several submodules (
SYMBI RESONATE
, 
trust-protocol-1
, etc.).

=E2=86=92 If any of these repos evolve independently, they can desync from =
main builds.

=E2=9C=85 
Fix:
 Add a C=
I job to automatically validate submodule commit hashes and run a compatibi=
lity test after 
git submodule upd=
ate --init --recursive
.

2. 
TypeScript Regression Risk

Commit 
Fix all TypeScript errors and publish v0.1.0
 suggests =
prior type failures.

=E2=86=92 If strict mode isn=E2=80=99t enforced in 
tsconfig.json
, regressions could reappear silently=
.

=E2=9C=85 
Fix:
 Ensure =

"strict": true
, 
"noImplicitAny": true
, and 
"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
 are active. Add 
tsc --noEmi=
t
 to your pre-commit or CI check.
