Publish Process

Use 
semantic-release
 or GitHub Releases to automate publis=
hing when commits meet specific criteria (e.g. conventional commits).

Ensure 
package.json
 defines 
"files"
 to prevent publishing test code or docs to NPM=
.

=F0=9F=93=91 Documentation & =
Contributor Experience

Readability
: Consolidate high-level docs like 
EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
, 
TRUST_FRAMEWORK.md
, and 
SYMBI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
 into a=

/docs/overview.md
 that =
links to deeper resources. This helps newcomers navigate the project more e=
asily.

Contributor Guidelines
:

There is a 
CONTRIBUTING.md
 and 
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
, but add a 
CODEOWNERS
 file to clarify maintainers for ea=
ch module.

Add a 
docs/architecture.md
 diagram showing how agent, auth=
, trust, and monitoring interact.

Env Configuration
: Provide a schema or example file (
.env.example
) with each e=
nvironment variable described. Use runtime validation (e.g. via 
zod
) so misconfigured deployments f=
ail early.

=F0=9F=94=92 Security & Compl=
iance

Dependabot & npm audit
: Enable Dependabot to watch=
 for outdated dependencies and run 
npm audit
 in CI. Patch high-severity vulnerabilities promptly.

Token & Secrets Handling
: Ensure that no API keys =
or secrets are committed, even in example files. Use environment variables =
exclusively and document how to set them securely.

Data Privacy
: The trust protocol touches personally id=
entifiable data (DIDs, credentials). Document how data is stored and for ho=
w long, ensuring compliance with relevant data-protection regulations.

=E2=9C=85 Summary of Recommendati=
ons

Enable strict TypeScript
 and static analysis across al=
l modules.

Introduce a proper monorepo tool
 to manage sub-package=
s and release flows.

Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline
 (unit tests, linting=
, type checks, coverage).

Fix cryptographic functions
 in 
crypto.ts
 (base58 decode, RSA padding, Ed25519 =
handling).

Increase test coverage
 and include edge-case and error=
-condition tests.

Consolidate documentation
 into an easily discoverable =
index with architecture diagrams.

Harden environment configs
 with schema validation and =
example files.

Automate releases
 via semantic versioning and ensure o=
nly compiled assets are published.

Add security scanning & dependabot
 to catch vulner=
able dependencies.

Clarify contributor ownership
 with CODEOWNERS and main=
tainers for each module.

By addressing these areas, the SYMBI=E2=80=91Symphony project w=
ill be more resilient, easier to maintain, and ready for contributions and =
production use.
