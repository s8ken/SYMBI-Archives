4. 
Environment Variable Safety

.env.example
 is present, but ensure no sensitive defaults =
or tokens (even placeholders like 
API_KEY=3Ddemo
) are leaking during Vercel deploys.

=E2=9C=85 
Fix:
 Add 
env
 schema validation (e.=
g., with 
zod
 or 
envsafe
) to catch missing keys a=
t runtime.

5. 
Monorepo Dependency Resolution

The repo appears multi-package (
core/agent
, 
@symbi/trust-protocol
, etc.) =E2=80=94=
 npm linking can introduce cross-build race conditions.

=E2=9C=85 
Fix:
 Use 
pnpm workspaces
 or a =

turbo.json
 pipeline to c=
ontrol dependency graph and ensure atomic builds.

6. 
Continuous Integration Matrix

Add matrix testing for:

Node 18 / 20

Bun (if used for local agent work)=

Vercel preview deployment verifica=
tion

=E2=86=92 Prevent hidden environment drift.

7. 
Automated Semantic Versioning

You=E2=80=99ve already published 
v0.1.0
.

=E2=9C=85 Add 
semantic-release
 to automate version bumps and changelog consistency based on commit =
messages.

8. 
Documentation Drift Protection

Files like 
IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
, 
TRUST_FRAMEWORK.md
, and 
SYMBI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
 evolve independe=
ntly.

=E2=9C=85 Add a 
docs/consistenc=
y.test.ts
 that parses those Markdown files for required section head=
ers or dates (ensuring alignment with current state).

9. 
Security Audit

You have a 
SECURITY.md
, but GitHub=E2=80=99s security tab =
flagged 
97 issues
 (p=
er page snippet).

=E2=9C=85 Run 
npm audit --omit=
=3Ddev
 and patch criticals.

=E2=9C=85 Consider integrating Dependabot with 
"schedule": "weekly"
.

10. 
DX & Dev Tools

Include a unified 
dev
 command that spins up local API + de=
mo environment.

Add Husky pre-commit hooks:

bash

Copy code

npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 

"pnpm lint && pnpm test"

11. 
Code Ownership / Governance

You already have 
CONTRIBUTING.md
 and 
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
.

=E2=9C=85 Add a 
.github/CODEOWN=
ERS
 file mapping directories to maintainers to streamline PR reviews=
.

12. 
Vercel Health Monitoring

Since you deploy via Vercel, enabl=
e a daily =E2=80=9Csmoke check=E2=80=9D endpoint (e.g., 
/api/healthz
) and add GitHub Action to call=
 it nightly.

=E2=86=92 This would detect any production API regressions early.

=F0=9F=9A=80 
Next Steps

=E2=9C=85 Enable strict TypeScript=
 + Jest coverage enforcement.

=F0=9F=94=81 Add CI workflows (lin=
t, typecheck, tests).

=F0=9F=A7=AA Automate submodule sy=
nc checks.

=F0=9F=94=92 Run 
npm audit
 and fix flagged dependencies.

=F0=9F=A7=AD Add 
turbo.json
 or 
pnpm-workspace.yaml
 for structured builds.

Would you like me to 
generate a 
ci.yml
 wo=
rkflow
 for your repo that includes type-checking, testing, linting=
, and submodule validation?

It would integrate seamlessly with your current Vercel setup.

egressions

1. TypeScript build integrity

Last major commit message says: 
=E2=80=9CFix all TypeScript errors and =
publish v0.1.0 to npm.=E2=80=9D

=E2=86=92 If TypeScript errors were force-suppressed with 
any
 or 
@ts-ignore
, regressions may reappear during refactors.

=F0=9F=94=8D 
Check:

tsc --noEmit
 again after=
 merging new submodules (
trust-pr=
otocol-1
, 
SYMBI SYNERGY
, etc.) to catch reintroduced type gaps.

2. Submodule version drift
