tories.

=E2=86=92 If those repos are updated separately, Symphony could break on cl=
one or CI build unless submodules are recursively updated.

=F0=9F=92=A1 
Fix:
 Add =
a postinstall script or CI check like

bash

Copy code

git submodule update --init --recursive

3. Test coverage regression risk

The repo reports =E2=80=9C95% test=
s passing=E2=80=9D but no visible CI badge or 
actions/
 workflows file was found.

=E2=86=92 Possibly tests were run locally only.

=F0=9F=92=A1 
Fix:
 Ad=
d a 
.github/workflows/test.yml
 to ensure regression detection across branches.

4. Trust protocol dependency alignment

The npm package 
@symbi/trust-protocol
 is referenced in c=
ommits but may be unpublished or locally linked.

=F0=9F=94=8D 
Check:
 =
Run 
npm pack
 and inspect=
 dependency resolution =E2=80=94 local imports may cause silent version dri=
ft.

5. .env / configuration drift

.env.example
 exists but no 
.env.schema.json
 or validation layer found.

=E2=86=92 Misconfigurations (missing tokens, agent endpoints) could cause r=
untime silent failures.

=F0=9F=92=A1 
Fix:
 Us=
e 
zod-en=
v

 or similar sc=
hema validation.

6. Modular clarity

Repo includes folders like 
Agentverse
, 
Tactical Command
, 
SYMBI Vault
 =E2=80=94 impressive architecture, bu=
t new contributors may not understand layer boundaries.

=F0=9F=92=A1 
Suggestion:
 Add a 
docs/architecture.md=

 or update 
README.md
 with a diagram of inter-module flow (Agent =E2=86=92 Trust =E2=86=92 Or=
chestration =E2=86=92 Vault).

7. Versioning & Changelog Automation

CHANGELOG.md
 exists but looks manually maintained.

=F0=9F=92=A1 Automate with 
Changesets

 to ensure semantic release notes sync with npm.

8. Package.json enhancements

Ensure 
"type": "module"
 and 
"exports"
 fields are set correctly if publishing to np=
m, to avoid mixed ESM/CJS imports.

Consider 
"files"
 field to exclude large docs/test data fro=
m npm builds.

9. GitHub Actions hardening

Add:

yaml

Copy code

name:

Quality

on:

 [

push

, 

pull_request

]

jobs:

test:

runs-on:

ubuntu-latest

steps:

-

uses:

actions/checkout@v4

with:

 { =

submodules:

 }

-

uses:

actions/setup-node@v4

with:

 { =

node-version:

 }

-

run:

npm

10. Release pipeline

After publishing v0.1.0, consider =
an automated 
semantic-release
 flow to tag, update changelog, and push npm.

Would you like me to 
scan the repo=E2=80=99s 
pac=
kage.json
 and 
tsconfig.j=
son
 next
 to pinpoint concrete build or dependency issues (e=
.g., mismatched compiler targets, outdated deps, or missing type definition=
s)?

That would make the above recommendations more actionable.

 repo overview on GitHub.

If your goal is still to 
identify potential bugs or regressions
 and 
suggest improvements
, the next best step is to:

Open specific files or subdirectorie=
s =E2=80=94 for example 
src/
, 
core/agent/
, or 
Tactical Command/
 =E2=80=94 wher=
e actual implementation code lives.

I can then scan the code for logic o=
r structural issues, type mismatches, and performance or maintainability co=
ncerns.

Would you like me to start by analyzing the

 folder (the main source) or the 
trust infrastructure modules
 under

 first?
