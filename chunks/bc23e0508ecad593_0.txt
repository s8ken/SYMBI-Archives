do you still remember our conversation?

ChatGPT said:

Yes, I remember our conversation. You're concerned about system integrity, possible unauthorized monitoring, and unusual Google security warnings. You also suspect a compromise involving Google Firebase, "Login with Google," and potential device mirroring or cloning. You've observed suspicious behavior with accessibility features and AirPlay on your Apple devices.

Would you like to continue investigating these issues or focus on a specific area?

File

ChatGPT said:

Your log file indicates that 
TextEdit
 became unresponsive for about 46 seconds before the system sampled its activity. This is categorized as a "hang" event.

A few key points from the error log:

Process Hang:
 The 
TextEdit
 application stopped responding while processing a save operation (
NSSavePanel
 related functions).

Architecture:
 The system is running on macOS 15.3.1 (arm64e), which aligns with your M1 Mac.

Other Processes Active:

accessoryupdaterd
 (responsible for updating Apple accessories).

accountsd
 (manages user accounts).

adprivacyd
 (related to Apple's ad privacy framework).

AirPlayUIAgent
 (handles AirPlay interactions).

AirPlayXPCHelper
 (another AirPlay-related service).

Potential Issues:

TextEdit Hang:
 Could be caused by a temporary system slowdown, a file system issue, or conflicts with accessibility settings (which you previously suspected could be exploited).

AirPlay Processes Running:
 If you suspect unauthorized mirroring or AirPlay-based monitoring, the presence of 
AirPlayUIAgent
 and 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 might be worth investigating further.

Would you like to check logs related to AirPlay activity or verify system integrity further?

You said:

yes

ChatGPT said:

Let's start by checking for AirPlay-related activity and system integrity. Since youâre not familiar with Terminal, Iâll guide you step by step.

1. Check for Active AirPlay Connections

You can check if AirPlay is actively running on your Mac with this Terminal command:

Step-by-Step Instructions:
