 Terminal).

Copy and paste the following command and press 
Enter
:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPNetworkDataType | grep AirPlay

This will show if AirPlay devices are currently detected on your network.

If you see any suspicious devices, note their names or addresses.

2. List Recent AirPlay Logs

To see logs of AirPlay activity, use this command:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.AirPlay"'

 --last 1h

This will display AirPlay-related logs from the last hour. If you want to check for a longer time frame, replace 
1h
 with 
24h
 for the past day.

3. Check for Unauthorized AirPlay Receivers

If you suspect a hidden AirPlay receiver, check if your Mac is an 
AirPlay Receiver
:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active

If the result is 
1
, your Mac is 
acting as an AirPlay receiver
 (which might be unexpected).

If 
0
, it's disabled.

If you see 
1
 and you donât recall enabling it, you can turn it off with:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

(Youâll need to enter your Macâs password when running this.)

4. Scan for Mirroring-Related Services

Since you suspect device mirroring, check for processes that might indicate screen-sharing or remote control:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screensharing|airplay|vnc'

If you see any process other than 
grep
, let me know what appears.

Would you like help analyzing the results once you run these? If you see anything suspicious, I can help interpret what it means.

Since the command returned 
no output
, it means your Mac 
does not currently detect any AirPlay devices on the network
. This suggests that no AirPlay connections are actively in use at this moment.

However, that doesnât rule out past activity or potential hidden configurations. Letâs continue with the next steps:

1. Check Recent AirPlay Logs

Run this command to check AirPlay-related activity in the past hour:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.AirPlay"'

 --last 1h

If you donât see anything, try extending the search to 24 hours:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.AirPlay"'

 --last 24h

2. Check if Your Mac Is Set as an AirPlay Receiver

Run this command to see if your Mac is acting as an 
AirPlay receiver
 (which could allow another device to stream to it):

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active

If the output is 
1

, your Mac is set up as an AirPlay receiver.

If 
0

, itâs disabled.

If 
1
 appears and you didnât enable it, disable it with:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

3. Check for Mirroring or Remote Access Processes

Run this to look for any screen-sharing or remote control processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screensharing|airplay|vnc'

If 
anything appears other than 
grep
 itself
, let me know so we can investigate further.

Try these steps and let me know what you find! If you see anything unusual in the logs or processes, we can dig deeper.
