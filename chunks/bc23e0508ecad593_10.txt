 for surveillance.

If 
an unknown process appears in the camera check
, weâll investigate further.

If you still suspect monitoring, 
weâll check for deeper malware infections.

â OBS Is Not Actively Running Right Now

Your 
ps aux | grep OBS
 command shows 
only the grep command itself
, which means 
OBS is not currently running in the background.

ð Next Step: Check If Anything Is Using Your Camera

Since 
OBS had a system extension
, but isn't listed under "Camera" in System Settings, we need to 
see if another process is using the camera.

Run this command:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If 
any process appears
, it means something is actively using your camera.

Let me know 
what process name appears.

ðï¸ Uninstall OBS Completely (To Prevent Future Use)

Even though itâs not running now, 
OBS still has files on your system
, including a 
camera system extension
 that could be reactivated.

Run these commands to remove it fully:

ð¹ 
Delete OBS from Applications:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/OBS.app

ð¹ 
Delete the OBS Camera System Extension:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

ð¹ 
Remove OBS Config Files:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.obsproject.obs-studio.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/obs-studio/

ð Final Check: Was OBS Set to Start Automatically?

Run this command to see if 
OBS was configured to auto-start
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If 
anything related to OBS appears
, remove it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OBS-related file.)

â Final Step: Restart Your Mac

After removing everything, restart your Mac to ensure 
OBS and its system extension are completely removed.

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

ð Summary: What You Must Do Next

â 
Check if anything is using your camera (
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
)

â 
Completely remove OBS and its camera extension

â 
Check if OBS was set to auto-start and delete it if found

â 
Restart your Mac to finalize the cleanup

ð¬ Let Me Know What You Find!

If 
another process is using your camera
, weâll investigate further.

If 
OBS files keep returning
, it could be a sign of 
deeper malware.

If 
everything looks clean after reboot
, weâll do a final security check.

You're making progressâletâs 
secure your system fully! ð

â Good News: No Active Camera Access & No OBS Running

Since:

OBS is not running in the background
 (
ps aux | grep OBS
)

No process is currently using your camera
 (
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
)

Youâve removed OBS and its system extension

This means the immediate 
threat of unauthorized OBS-based monitoring is eliminated.

ð Final Security Checks (To Ensure No Hidden Backdoors)

Even though 
OBS is gone
, we should 
double-check for any leftover surveillance tools.

1ï¸â£ Check for Other Hidden Screen or Camera Access

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screen|camera|vnc|remote'

Look for 
any unexpected processes
 that might be accessing your screen or webcam.

Let me know 
if anything suspicious appears.

2ï¸â£ Check for Suspicious Network Connections

If hackers were 
streaming your screen or camera
, there may be a 
hidden network connection
 sending data.

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If you 
see active network connections
, note any 
IP addresses
 that look unfamiliar.

Let me know if anything stands out.
