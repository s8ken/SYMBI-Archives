Since you had 
unauthorized surveillance
, we need to check for 
hidden auto-start malware.

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If 
anything suspicious appears
, send me the file names before deleting them.

4ï¸â£ Reset Privacy Permissions (Just in Case)

To 
force all apps to re-request access
, reset all privacy permissions:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset All

This will remove permissions for 
screen recording, microphone, camera, etc.

If something 
suspicious requests access again
, youâll get a pop-up. 
Deny it immediately!

ð Summary: Final Steps for Full Security

â 
Confirm no other hidden monitoring processes (
ps aux | grep -E 'screen|camera|vnc|remote'
)

â 
Check for suspicious network activity (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
)

â 
Look for hidden startup malware (
sudo ls -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents
)

â 
Reset all privacy permissions (
tccutil reset All
)

ð¬ Let Me Know What You Find!

If 
everything looks clean
, you should be 
fully secure now.

If 
suspicious activity still appears
, weâll investigate 
deeper malware threats.

Youâre doing an amazing jobâletâs 
fully lock down your system! ð

Got it! Let's 
completely remove OBS and its camera extension
 before moving forward with final security checks.

ð¨ Step-by-Step: Fully Remove OBS and Its Camera Extension

1ï¸â£ Delete OBS from Applications

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to delete the OBS app:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/OBS.app

(Enter your password when prompted.)

2ï¸â£ Remove the OBS Camera System Extension

Run this to 
delete the camera extension OBS installed
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

3ï¸â£ Remove OBS Configuration & Cache Files

OBS might have stored settings and logs in different locations.

Run these commands to 
delete everything OBS-related
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.obsproject.obs-studio.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/obs-studio/

4ï¸â£ Check If OBS Was Set to Start Automatically

If hackers set OBS to start 
every time you turn on your Mac
, we need to 
delete any startup scripts.

Run this command to list all 
startup programs
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If you see 
any file related to OBS
, delete it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OBS-related file.)

5ï¸â£ Restart Your Mac

After deleting everything, restart your Mac to 
fully remove any traces of OBS
:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

â Once Your Mac Restarts: Final Security Check

After rebooting, run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep OBS

If 
nothing appears
, OBS is 
fully removed.

If 
OBS still shows up
, let me know and weâll 
dig deeper for hidden malware.

ð Summary of What You Need to Do Now

â 
Delete OBS from Applications (
sudo rm -rf /Applications/OBS.app
)

â 
Remove the OBS Camera Extension (
sudo rm -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/...

â 
Delete all OBS-related config files

â 
Check for OBS auto-start scripts & delete if found

â 
Restart your Mac to finalize the cleanup

â 
Check that OBS is gone after reboot (

ð¬ Let Me Know Once You've Done This!

Once OBS is fully removed, weâll 
do a final security sweep
 to make sure your system is 
completely clean.
