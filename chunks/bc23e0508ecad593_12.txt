ð macOS System Protection is Blocking Deletion

The error 
"Operation not permitted"
 means macOS 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 is preventing you from deleting the OBS system extension. 
SIP is a security feature that protects system files from unauthorized modification.

Since you 
want to fully remove OBS
, you will need to 
disable SIP temporarily, delete the files, and then re-enable SIP
 to keep your system protected.

ð¨ Step-by-Step: Disable SIP, Remove OBS, and Re-Enable SIP

1ï¸â£ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Press and hold
 the 
Power button
 until you see "Loading startup options."

Click 'Options' > Continue
 to enter macOS 
Recovery Mode.

Enter your admin password
 if prompted.

2ï¸â£ Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)

In 
macOS Recovery Mode
, click 
Utilities
 in the menu bar and select 
Terminal
.

Type the following command and press 
Enter
:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

You should see a message saying 
"Successfully disabled System Integrity Protection."

Restart your Mac.

3ï¸â£ Delete the OBS System Extension

Now that SIP is disabled, 
run this command again to remove OBS completely
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

You should no longer see 
"Operation not permitted."

4ï¸â£ Re-Enable SIP (To Keep Your System Secure)

After deleting OBS, you 
must turn SIP back on
 to prevent future malware from modifying system files.

Restart your Mac and go back into macOS Recovery Mode

Open 
Terminal
 and type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

â Final Check After Restart

Once your Mac restarts, confirm that OBS is 
completely removed
 by running:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/SystemExtensions/

If 
the OBS folder is gone
, the removal was successful! ð

ð Summary of What You Need to Do

â 
Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

â 
Disable SIP (
csrutil disable
)

â 
Restart & Delete the OBS system extension (
sudo rm -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/...
)
