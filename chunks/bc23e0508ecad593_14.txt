ð¨ Your Camera Plugin Is Already Missing

Since both commands returned 
"No such file or directory"
, this means:

The AppleCamera.plugin has already been removed, disabled, or hidden.

Malware may have tampered with system files to evade detection.

â Next Steps: Confirm If the Camera is Truly Disabled

Even though the plugin is missing, letâs 
double-check if the camera is still working.

1ï¸â£ Test Camera in Built-in Apps

Open 
FaceTime
 or 
Photo Booth

If you get 
"No camera available"
 or a black screen, the camera is already disabled!

If the camera 
still works
, hackers may be using a 
virtual webcam driver
 to bypass macOS settings.

2ï¸â£ Check for Fake or Virtual Camera Drivers

If malware installed a 
fake camera driver
, it may still be active.

Run this command to list all installed camera drivers:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

If 
nothing appears
, the camera is truly disabled.

If a camera 
still shows up
, let me know what it says.

3ï¸â£ Check for Hidden Camera Processes

Run this command to see if 
anything is trying to access your camera
:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If 
no output appears
, your camera is 
not in use.

If 
a process appears
, note the name and 
let me know
 so we can shut it down.

ð¬ Let Me Know What You Find

â 
Does FaceTime or Photo Booth say "No Camera Available"?

â 
What does 
system_profiler SPCameraDataType
 show?

â 
Does 
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
 return anything?

This will confirm whether your camera is 
truly disabled or if hackers are still accessing it.

ð¨ The Camera is Still WorkingâLetâs Shut It Down Completely

Since your camera 
is still active
, but 
the system plugin is missing
, this suggests:

A virtual camera driver or hidden process is controlling it.

Malware could be using a non-standard method to keep the camera running.

Another system extension might be responsible for re-enabling it.

ð Step 1: Check for Hidden Camera Drivers

Run this command to 
list all installed camera hardware and drivers:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

If a camera 
still appears
, macOS is detecting an active driver.

Let me know 
exactly what the output says.

ð Step 2: Find Out What Process is Using the Camera

Since 
AppleCamera.plugin
 is missing, something else is controlling the camera. Letâs find it:

Run this command:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If 
any process appears
, it means something is actively using your camera.

Tell me the name of the process
 so we can shut it down.

ð Step 3: Check for Fake Camera Extensions

Malware can install 
fake virtual webcams
 that act like real ones.

Run this command:

sh

Copy

kextstat | grep -i camera

If 
any result appears
, it means a 
kernel extension (kext) related to a camera
 is loaded.

Let me know the output.

ð Step 4: Force Kill Any Suspicious Camera Processes

Once we find which process is using the camera, 
we will kill it.

If 
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
 gives a process name and PID, use:

sh

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual process ID.)

If a 
camera driver is active in 
kextstat

, we will 
unload it manually
.

ð Next Steps

â 
Run 
system_profiler SPCameraDataType
 and tell me what it says.

â 
Run 
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
 and note any processes.

â 
Run 
kextstat | grep -i camera
 to check for hidden drivers.

Once we find 
what is keeping the camera active,
 we will 
completely remove it.

You're doing greatâletâs fully lock down your system! ð
