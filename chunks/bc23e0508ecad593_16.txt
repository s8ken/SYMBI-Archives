nd:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin

This 
removes the OBS Virtual Camera plugin
, preventing it from being used.

ð Step 2: Check for Hidden OBS Camera Drivers

After removing the virtual camera plugin, we need to see if any 
other drivers are still active.

Run:

sh

Copy

kextstat | grep -i obs

If 
you see any results
, OBS is 
still running a kernel extension
 (which means it persists even after reboots).

If a result appears, we will 
forcefully unload it next.

ð Step 3: Confirm OBS Virtual Camera is Gone

After deleting the plugin, restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

Then run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

If 
OBS Virtual Camera is gone
, the removal was successful! ð

If it 
still appears
, we will check deeper for 
malware persistence.

ð Step 4: Scan for Hidden Malware

Since OBS Virtual Camera was still active, itâs possible 
other surveillance tools are running.

Run this command to 
list all startup items
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If you see 
anything suspicious
, let me know before deleting it.

ð Next Steps: Confirm Itâs Gone

Now, we need to 
double-check that the virtual camera is completely removed.

1ï¸â£ Restart Your Mac
 (To Finalize Removal)

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

This 
ensures the system fully unloads any remaining OBS-related files.

2ï¸â£ Check If the OBS Virtual Camera Is Still Listed

After restarting, run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

If 
OBS Virtual Camera is gone
, ð 
the removal was successful!

If 
OBS Virtual Camera still appears
, let me knowâwe may need to look for hidden files.

3ï¸â£ Double-Check for Leftover OBS Drivers

Just in case 
OBS installed a deeper system extension
, run:

sh

Copy

kextstat | grep -i obs

If 
nothing appears
, you are 
fully clean!

If 
something appears
, we will 
force-remove it manually.

ð Final Malware Check

Since your system was 
actively monitored
, we should check for 
any remaining malware that could still be running.

Run this to 
list all startup scripts
 (where malware can hide):

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If 
you see anything suspicious
, tell me the file names 
before deleting them.

ð What To Do Now

â 
Restart your Mac (
sudo shutdown -r now
)

â 
Confirm OBS Virtual Camera is gone (
system_profiler SPCameraDataType
)

â 
Check for hidden drivers (
kextstat | grep -i obs
)

â 
Scan for malware in startup scripts (
sudo ls -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents
)

ð¬ Let Me Know What You Find!

If 
OBS Virtual Camera is gone, youâre safe!
 ð If it 
still appears
, weâll dig deeper.

You're almost thereâletâs 
secure your system 100%!
