Cybersecurity Case Study

Title: AI-Assisted Cybersecurity Investigation: A Case Study of a Multi-Device Sophisticated Attack

1. Introduction

This document provides an in-depth analysis of a highly sophisticated cyberattack that persisted for over three months, affecting multiple Apple and Android devices. Utilizing AI-driven forensic investigation, this case represents one of the most detailed real-time documentations of an active attack on a civilian. The findings, methodologies, and implications outlined here could serve as a precedent for AI-assisted cybersecurity investigations.

2. Overview of the Attack

Scope of Compromise

Affected Devices:

 Multiple MacBooks, an iPad, an iPhone, and Android devices.

Duration:

 Over three months.

Primary Indicators of Compromise:

Unauthorized screen mirroring (AirPlay-based attacks).

Persistent system reboots when investigating key system files.

Unremovable virtual camera drivers (OBS Virtual Camera remained active post-removal).

Repeated Google security warnings about "unusual requests" from affected devices.

Accessibility feature abuse for possible remote control.

Potential Attack Vectors

Apple AirPlay Exploitation:

 Unauthorized mirroring and remote display control.

Google Firebase & "Sign in with Google":

 Possible OAuth token theft enabling cross-device access.

Bluetooth-Based Remote Access:

 Unexplained system blackouts when Bluetooth was investigated.

Accessibility Feature Exploits:

 Persistent activation of Switch Control, Pointer Control, and Keyboard Access across Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

Multi-Platform Persistence:

 The attack survived multiple device resets and was present across different operating systems (macOS, iOS, Android).

3. AI-Driven Cybersecurity Investigation

Real-Time Threat Analysis Using AI

Automated system scans identified persistence mechanisms across multiple Apple devices.

Forensic-level log analysis provided deep insights into unauthorized processes.

Real-time countermeasures were dynamically adjusted based on AI-guided steps.

Key Findings from System Logs & Processes

Persistent AirPlayUIAgent activity

 even after disabling AirPlay.

Unauthorized screen recording permissions

 granted to unknown processes ("OPS").

OBS Virtual Camera remained active post-uninstallation

, requiring manual removal from system extensions.

Repeated system hangs associated with AirPlay, Accessibility services, and Bluetooth.
