Final Analysis: No Signs of Active AirPlay or Mirroring

Your results confirm that 
AirPlay and screen-sharing are not currently active
 on your Mac:

â 
No recent AirPlay logs
 â No evidence of streaming or mirroring activity.

â 
No screen-sharing, VNC, or AirPlay processes running
 â No remote access detected.

â 
AirPlay receiver setting does not exist
 â This means 
your Mac is not configured as an AirPlay receiver
, so other devices cannot stream to it.

What This Means for Your Security Concerns

Your Mac does not currently appear to be compromised via AirPlay mirroring.

There is no active screen-sharing or VNC remote control process running.

AirPlay receiving is not enabled, meaning another device cannot send a stream to your Mac.

This suggests that if 
AirPlay or mirroring was used in the past
, it is no longer active. If you still suspect a compromise, we can look deeper into past logs, startup processes, or network activity to see if something was previously active and then disabled.

Would you like to investigate further, or does this ease your concerns for now?

Analysis of the 1st Hang Report

Your Mac experienced a 
TextEdit application hang
 that lasted 
251 seconds (over 4 minutes)
 before the system sampled the process.

Key Observations:

TextEdit Hang Cause:

The issue appears related to 
NSSavePanel
, which is responsible for saving files.

The process was stuck in a layout operation involving 
NSTextView
 and 
NSTextViewportLayoutController
, which manage text rendering.

This suggests TextEdit might have frozen while trying to 
save or render a document
.

System Context at the Time:

Accessory Updater (
accessoryupdaterd
) was running
 â This process updates Apple accessories.

Accountsd (
accountsd
) was running
 â Manages user accounts and Apple ID credentials.

AirPlayUIAgent was active
 â This is concerning because it handles 
AirPlay streaming and mirroring
.

Adprivacyd and AdID processes were running
 â These are related to Apple's privacy and advertising services.

AirPlayUIAgent Activity

The presence of 
AirPlayUIAgent
 suggests AirPlay was at least 
initialized
.

There is no direct evidence that an active AirPlay session was in progress, but its presence could indicate some 
background interaction
 with AirPlay services.

Next Steps:

Check if AirPlayUIAgent is Persistently Running

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep AirPlayUIAgent

If you see an entry (besides 
grep
), AirPlayUIAgent is still running.

If you didnât manually enable AirPlay, this might indicate unwanted activity.

Check for System Logs Related to AirPlay

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process == "AirPlayUIAgent"'

 --last 24h

This will display logs from the 
past 24 hours
 related to AirPlayUIAgent.

Check System Settings:

Go to 
System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff
 and check if 
"Allow AirPlay Receiver"
 is enabled.

If it is 
on
, consider turning it 
off
 unless you need it.

Disable AirPlay Receiver (If Needed)

If your Mac is unexpectedly acting as an AirPlay receiver, disable it using:

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active -bool 

false

(Enter your password when prompted.)
