ð¨ THOR Lite Can't Find the License File â Letâs Fix It

THOR Lite is 
not detecting 
thor-license.txt

, even though it's in the correct folder. Here's how to troubleshoot:

1ï¸â£ Verify the License File

Run this command to check the file details:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l thor-license.txt

If the file is 
empty or incorrect
, that may be the issue. Let me know what it says.

2ï¸â£ Ensure the License Belongs to Your Hostname

THOR Lite expects the 
license to match your Mac's hostname.

Run this command:

sh

Copy

hostname

Compare the output with the 
license filename
 you originally downloaded. If they donât match, you might need a 
new license tied to the correct hostname.

3ï¸â£ Try Running THOR Lite with the License Specified

Manually point THOR Lite to the license file:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license thor-license.txt

This forces it to recognize the license.

4ï¸â£ (If Needed) Re-Download the License

If the issue persists, request a new license:

Go to 

THOR Lite License Page

Re-download the 
correct license for your hostname

Move it into 
/Applications/thor10/

Retry running THOR Lite

ð¬ Let Me Know What Happens!

If you still get an error, send me the output of 
ls -l thor-license.txt
 and 
hostname
, and Iâll guide you further. ð

ð¨ THOR Lite Still Can't Find the License â Let's Fix It

Your 
thor-license.txt
 file 
exists
, but THOR Lite 
isnât recognizing it
. This could be due to:

Wrong hostname in the license file

A formatting issue with the license file

1ï¸â£ Check If the License Matches Your Mac's Hostname

Run this command to verify your systemâs hostname:

sh

Copy

hostname

Compare it with 
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
 (from the error).

If They Donât Match:

You need to 
request a new license file
 for your actual hostname.

Go to 

THOR Lite License Page

Generate a new license using the exact hostname from 
hostname

Replace the old license file in 
/Applications/thor10/

2ï¸â£ Try Manually Specifying the License File

Even if the license is correct, THOR Lite might not be finding it.

Try this command:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license ./thor-license.txt

3ï¸â£ Check the License Fileâs Content

Run:

sh

Copy

cat

 thor-license.txt

You should see 
a key or text block.
 If the file is 
empty or corrupted
, request a 
new one
.

ð¬ Let Me Know What You Find!

If the 
hostname doesn't match
 or the 
license file is blank
, we'll need to replace it. ð

It looks like you uploaded the 
license file again
. To make sure THOR Lite recognizes it, let's rename and move it correctly.

1ï¸â£ Rename the License File

In 
Terminal
, run:

sh

Copy

mv

 /Applications/thor10/thor-lite-bedccd25-edfd91d3-20250228-20250831.lic /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

2ï¸â£ Verify the File is in the Right Place

Run:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/

You should see 

thor-license.txt

 listed.

3ï¸â£ Run THOR Lite With the License

Now, try running THOR Lite:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license ./thor-license.txt

ð¬ Let Me Know If It Works!

If you 
still get an error
, weâll check the hostname inside the file to ensure it matches your system. ð
