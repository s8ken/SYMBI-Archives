It looks like the 
license file isnât in the 
/Applications/thor10/
 folder
. Let's find it and move it to the correct location.

1ï¸â£ Find Where the License File Is

Run this command to locate the file:

sh

Copy

find ~/Downloads /Applications -name 

"thor-lite-*.lic"

This will 
search for the license file
 in the Downloads folder and Applications.

2ï¸â£ Move the File to the THOR Lite Folder

If the above command finds the file, move it to the correct location by running:

sh

Copy

mv

 /path/to/license/file /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

(Replace 
/path/to/license/file
 with the actual path shown in the search result.)

3ï¸â£ Verify the File is in the Right Place

Check if the file is now in the correct folder:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/

You should see 

thor-license.txt

 listed.

4ï¸â£ Run THOR Lite Again

Once the license file is in the right place, try:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license ./thor-license.txt

ð¬ Let Me Know What You Find!

If the file 
is missing or wonât move
, we may need to 
re-download the license
 from Nextron Systems. ð

yes it worked I am getting scam modes and scan options etc.

ChatGPT said:

Awesome! ð That means THOR Lite is now running properly!

Now, you can 
choose a scan mode
 and let it analyze your system. I recommend starting with:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --quick

This 
runs a fast scan
 to check for common threats.

If you want a 
deeper analysis
, you can use:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --full

This takes longer but is 
more thorough
.

ð¬ Whatâs Next?

If the scan 
detects anything suspicious
, let me know, and weâll analyze the results together.

If you get any 
errors or warnings
, send me the details, and Iâll help troubleshoot.

You're doing greatâlet's see what THOR Lite finds! ðð

Got it! It looks like THOR Lite doesn't use 
--full
, so let's check the 
correct scan options.

1ï¸â£ View All Available Scan Options

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --fullhelp

This will show 
all possible scan modes
.

2ï¸â£ Recommended Scan Modes

Based on the official 

THOR manual

, try these:

Quick Scan (Faster)

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --quick

Runs a 
light scan
 that checks key areas of your system.

Good for a 
first check
 if you're short on time.

Deep Scan (Thorough)

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --intense

Scans 
all files
 and processes.

Takes 
longer
 but detects more advanced threats.

Scan with Logging (Recommended)

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --intense --logfile thor-scan.log

Saves scan results to 

thor-scan.log

 for later review.

3ï¸â£ Run Your Chosen Scan

Try 

--quick

 first if you're unsure.

If you have time, use 

--intense

 for a 
full security check
.

ð¬ Let Me Know If You Get Any Findings!

flags anything suspicious
, copy the results here, and Iâll help analyze them. ðð
