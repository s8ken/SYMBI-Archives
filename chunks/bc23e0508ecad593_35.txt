 to fix it.

2ï¸â£ Ensure the License File Matches Your Hostname

THOR Lite 
only works if the license matches your Macâs hostname.

Run this command:

sh

Copy

hostname

If it shows 

Mes-MacBook-Pro.local

, your license 
must be generated for this exact hostname
.

If your license was created for 
a different hostname
, you need to 
re-request it from Nextron Systems
.

3ï¸â£ Manually Point to the License File

Try running THOR Lite 
with the license file specified manually
:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If this works, then the scanner was just 
not automatically detecting the file
.

4ï¸â£ If It Still Fails, Request a New License

If the above steps 
donât work
, you likely need a 
new license file
.

Go to 

THOR Lite License Page

Enter your 
exact hostname (
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
)
 when requesting a license.

Download it and replace the old file in 
/Applications/thor10/
.

ð¬ Let Me Know If This Works!

If you still get 
âNo valid license file foundâ
, let me know what 
ls -l thor-license.txt
 and 
hostname
 show, and weâll troubleshoot further. ð

ð¨ THOR Lite Still Can't Find the LicenseâFinal Fixes

Your 
license file exists
 (
thor-license.txt
), but THOR Lite 
isn't recognizing it.
 Let's go through the final fixes step by step.

1ï¸â£ Check If the License File is Corrupted

Run:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

You should see 
license text
 inside the file.

If the file is empty
 or looks corrupted, youâll need to 
re-download it
 from Nextron.

If the text looks fine
, move on to the next step.

2ï¸â£ Manually Specify the License File in the Command

Try running THOR Lite with the 
license path explicitly defined
:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx --license /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If this works, then the scanner was just 
not automatically detecting the file
.

3ï¸â£ Check If THOR Lite Can Read the License File

The issue may be 
permissions
. Run:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

If it shows 

rw-r--r--

, that means only your user can access it.

To 
ensure THOR Lite can read the file
, try:

sh

Copy

sudo 

chmod

 644 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

Then retry:

sh

Copy

sudo ./thor-lite-macosx

4ï¸â£ If It Still Fails, Request a New License

If nothing works, the issue is likely that the 
license does not match your exact hostname (
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
)
.

Go to 

THOR Lite License Page

Enter your 
exact hostname (
Mes-MacBook-Pro.local
)
 when requesting a new license.

Download it and 
replace
 the old license file in 
/Applications/thor10/
.

ð¬ Let Me Know If This Works!

If you 
still get a license error
, let me know the output of:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt
hostname

And weâll troubleshoot further! ð

Great! Now, let's make sure THOR Lite can detect it.

1ï¸â£ Rename the License File

Move and rename the newly downloaded license file to

sh

Copy

mv

 /Applications/thor10/thor-lite-bedccd25-edfd91d3-20250228-20250831.lic /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt

2ï¸â£ Verify the File is in the Right Place

Check that it's correctly named and in the 
thor10
 folder:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/thor10/

You should see 

thor-license.txt

 listed.

3ï¸â£ Set Correct Permissions

Ensure THOR Lite can read the file:

sh

Copy

sudo 

chmod

 644 /Applications/thor10/thor-license.txt
