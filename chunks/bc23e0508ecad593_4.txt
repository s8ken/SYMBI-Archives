read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay receiver-active

If the result is

Analysis of the AirPlay Activity Logs

Your logs confirm that 
AirPlayUIAgent has been running persistently
 and interacting with system components. Some key findings:

AirPlayUIAgent Became Active Multiple Times

There were 
several instances where AirPlayUIAgent was started
 and checked in with system services.

The process was 
activated, then invalidated, then reactivated
 repeatedly.

This cycling behavior can indicate an 
attempt to start AirPlay mirroring or streaming
.

FigVirtualDisplayServer was Initiated

This is Apple's virtual display system used for 
AirPlay screen mirroring
.

Logs contain entries like:

pgsql

Copy

AirPlayUIAgent: (MediaToolbox) [com.apple.coremedia:] <<

<< FigVirtualDisplayServerCGVD >>

>> FigVirtualDisplayServerCGVDStart: 

Using

 SLContent 

Path

AirPlayUIAgent: (MediaToolbox) [com.apple.coremedia:] <<

<< FigVirtualDisplayServerSLVD >>

>> FigVirtualDisplayServerSLVDStart: Starting 

server

This strongly suggests that 
AirPlay screen mirroring was attempted at some point
.

AirPlayXPCHelper Interactions

AirPlayUIAgent repeatedly tried to establish connections with 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, which handles AirPlay-related communications.

There were multiple connection failures, suggesting it 
might have been trying to mirror to a device that was unavailable
.

TCC Access Request

TCCAccessRequest
 logs appear, which means 
AirPlay requested permission to access certain system features
.

This is usually needed when an app or process 
tries to access screen recording, microphone, or camera permissions
.

AirPlayUIAgent Not Always in Foreground

Some logs show it was 
registered as a background process
.

This could indicate that 
AirPlay mirroring was attempted in the background
, without an obvious o
