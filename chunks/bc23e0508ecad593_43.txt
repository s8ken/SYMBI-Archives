3ï¸â£ Check YouTube Live & Google Account History

ð 
https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard

https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup

Look for 
unauthorized sign-ins
 or 
newly connected apps.

4ï¸â£ Look for Suspicious Network Connections

Attackers may have streamed directly via 
RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)
 or another streaming protocol. Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep -i 

"rtmp\|twitch\|youtube"

ð¨ 
If this shows an active connection, the system might still be broadcasting!

5ï¸â£ Check macOSâs Recent Network Connections

sh

Copy

lsof -i -P | grep -i 

"stream\|rtmp\|obs\|broadcast"

This will list 
any apps currently or recently making network connections
 for streaming.
