ð¹ 
List all installed applications & check for suspicious ones:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications/

ð¹ 
List all running background processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux

Look for 
anything unusual or apps you donât recognize.

ð¹ 
List all startup items (could indicate persistence):

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If you see 
unexpected files
, they could be used to restart malware.

You can delete them with:

sh

ð¹ 
Check your Apple ID for unknown devices:

Go to

Apple ID Devices

Remove any devices you donât recognize.

Change your Apple ID & Google passwords

If hackers 
controlled your account
, they may have re-added themselves after the reset.

ð¹ 
Disable âSign in with Googleâ for all apps.

Final Steps: Consider a Full Factory Reset

If you still suspect hidden backdoors, the best option is 
to erase your Mac and reinstall macOS.

Boot into macOS Recovery
 by 
holding Command (â) + R
 while turning on your Mac.

Use 
Disk Utility
 to 
erase your drive completely
 (select 
APFS
 format).

Reinstall macOS fresh.

â ï¸ 
Do NOT restore from a backup
 unless youâre sure itâs clean. Hackers could have hidden malware inside.

The 
tccutil dump
 command doesnât work in recent macOS versions. Instead, letâs check screen recording permissions manually and then reset them if needed.

1ï¸â£ Check for Unauthorized Apps with Screen Recording Access

Since we canât list them via Terminal, manually check:

Go to
 â 
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording

Look for any 
apps that have access
.

If you see anything suspicious, click the toggle to turn it off.

2ï¸â£ Reset Screen Recording Permissions

If you suspect unauthorized apps 
previously had access
, reset all permissions:

ð¹ 
Run this command in Terminal
 to remove all app permissions for screen recording:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset ScreenCapture

This forces all apps to 
ask for permission again
.

If hackers were using a hidden app, 
they will lose access unless they request it again.

3ï¸â£ Monitor for Future Screen Recording Attempts

If someone tries to enable screen recording again, youâll get a pop-up asking for permission. 
If this happens unexpectedly, deny it immediately.

ð Next Steps

Let me know if you find suspicious apps in Screen Recording settings.

If the problem persists, weâll check for hidden processes running on your Mac. ð
