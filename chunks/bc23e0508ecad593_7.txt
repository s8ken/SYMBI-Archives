vestigate & Remove OPS

Since OPS has screen recording access, we need to 
find out what it is and remove it completely
.

1ï¸â£ Find Where OPS is Installed

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

mdfind 

"OPS"

This will search your entire Mac for any files related to "OPS."

ð¹ 
If you find it in 
/Applications/
, 
/Library/
, or 
~/Library/
, let me know the file path.

ð¹ If nothing shows up, it may be hidden.

2ï¸â£ Check if OPS is Running in the Background

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep OPS

If you see an entry 
other than grep
, OPS is currently running.

Note the 
PID number
 next to it and use this command to 
kill it
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the number shown in the process list.)

3ï¸â£ Check If OPS Starts at Boot (Persistence Check)

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If OPS appears in any of these locations, it means 
it auto-starts with your Mac
.

To remove it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OPS file found.)

4ï¸â£ Check for Hidden Malware (Rootkits, Keyloggers)

Since you suspect long-term monitoring, let's check for hidden malware:

ð¹ 
Run this to list all running processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux

Look for 
anything unusual
 or 
unknown apps
 running.

ð¹ 
Check active network connections (to see if OPS is sending data):

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If OPS is communicating with an external server, this could indicate a 
remote surveillance tool
.

5ï¸â£ Delete OPS Completely

If you find OPS installed anywhere:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

Then, 
empty the Trash
 and restart your Mac.

ð¨ Summary: What to Do Right Now

â 
Turn off & remove OPS from Screen Recording (System Settings > Privacy & Security)

â 
Find OPS on your Mac (
mdfind "OPS"
) & delete it if found

â 
Check if OPS is running (
ps aux | grep OPS
), kill the process if active

â 
Look for OPS in LaunchAgents & LaunchDaemons to remove persistence

â 
Check for suspicious network activity (
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
)

ð¬ Let Me Know What You Find!

If you find OPS in a 
specific folder
, tell me the path before deleting.

If you see 
suspicious network activity
, we may need to 
block connections
.

You're doing greatâletâs get this hacker out for good! ð
