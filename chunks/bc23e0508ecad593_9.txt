To see if OBS is 
launching at startup
, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If 
OBS appears in the list
, delete the related file with:

sh

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual OBS startup file.)

If removing OBS stops the issue, 
we need to check how it got installed.

If you still suspect monitoring, 
we will scan for additional spyware

ð¨ If OBS Is Not Listed Under Camera, But Has a Camera Extension

Since you 
found an OBS camera system extension
, but 
OBS is not listed under "Camera" in System Settings
, this could mean:

OBS was manually granted access but removed from settings after installation.

Hackers could have installed OBS and used its system extension to bypass macOS privacy settings.

OBS might still be running in the background without your knowledge.

ð Next Steps to Confirm If OBS Is Active

1ï¸â£ Check If OBS is Running in the Background

Run this command:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep OBS

If you see any 
OBS-related processes
 running, 
note the PID number
 and kill them:

sh

Copy

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

(Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual process number.)

2ï¸â£ Check If OBS Is Using the Camera Right Now

Even if itâs not listed under Camera settings, we can check if 
any process is using your camera
:

ð¹ 
Run this command:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep 

"AppleCamera"

If 
OBS or another unknown process appears
, it is 
actively using your camera
.

Let me know what process appears in the output.

3ï¸â£ Uninstall OBS Completely (Even If Itâs Not Listed)

Since OBS has a 
system extension for the camera
, 
we must remove it manually
.

ð¹ 
Delete OBS from Applications:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/OBS.app

ð¹ 
Remove the OBS Camera System Extension:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/SystemExtensions/FA1EB7A0-8C85-4041-A19F-C28AF36B7501/

ð¹ 
Delete OBS Configuration Files:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.obsproject.obs-studio.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.obsproject.obs-studio/
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/obs-studio/

4ï¸â£ Check If OBS Was Set to Start on Boot

If OBS is configured to start automatically, we 
must disable it
:

ð¹ 
List all startup processes:

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -l /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents

If you see anything related to 
OBS or unknown files
, delete them:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf [file_path]

(Replace 
[file_path]
 with the actual startup file.)

5ï¸â£ Restart Your Mac to Finalize the Changes

sh

Copy

sudo shutdown -r now

After the restart, 
OBS should be completely removed, and any hidden connections should be severed.

ð Summary: What You Must Do Now

â 
Check if OBS is running in the background (
ps aux | grep OBS
)

â 
Check if anything is using your camera (
lsof | grep "AppleCamera"
)

â 
Uninstall OBS manually, including system extensions

â 
Remove any auto-start scripts linked to OBS

â 
Restart your Mac to finalize the changes
