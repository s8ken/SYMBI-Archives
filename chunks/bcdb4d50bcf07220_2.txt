This imagery framewo=
rk should give you a strong visual foundation to work with! The contrast be=
tween the harsh, isolating outback environment and the intimate indoor mome=
nts will really help drive the emotional story.

A few=
 key visual themes that could work especially well:

The "frame within frame" concept
 - showing the boy looking out =
windows, or reflected in his device screen, emphasizing his separation from=
 the world outside.

Light as emotion
 - the artificial blue glow of the AI companion=
 vs. the warm golden light of real human connection in that final kitchen s=
cene.

The outback as a character
 - that endless, dusty landscape that=
 mirrors his internal isolation, but also represents the real world he's mi=
ssing out on.

The i=
magery can really help show rather than tell the story's themes. For instan=
ce, we could show his gradual withdrawal through increasingly tight close-u=
ps as he becomes more dependent on the AI, then gradually widen out again a=
s he reconnects with his mum.

This=
 emu encounter is perfect for several reasons:

Story-wise:
 It creates a concrete moment where the AI's limitat=
ions become crystal clear. The AI can offer generic advice, but it can't ph=
ysically protect him or solve the immediate problem. Only mum's real-world =
experience and presence can handle this situation.

Visually:
 The contrast is striking - the boy looking helplessly=
 at his screen while this massive bird dominates the space outside. Then mu=
m arrives and confidently takes charge with practical, physical action.

Character development:
 It shows mum as capable and protective, =
not just busy and absent. It also gives the boy a clear "aha moment" about =
what real help looks like.

Australian authenticity:
 Emus are genuinely problematic in rura=
l Australia - they're curious, destructive, and can be quite aggressive. It=
's a very relatable scenario for Australian kids.

The i=
magery could show this beautiful progression:

Boy cowering inside while emu l=
ooms outside

AI screen showing useless text =
advice

Mum's car arriving (relief!)

Mum confidently handling the si=
tuation

Boy's face showing realization =

human presence trumps digital support when it really matters. The kitchen a=
