Oh that's perfect! That adds =

Yes!=
 This adds such rich visual and thematic layers:

The YouTube hero imagery could be fantastic:

Split screens showing the confi=

The boy trying to copy the hero=

The stark contrast between the =
polished, dramatic video content and his actual helpless situation

Visual comedy potential:

Boy attempting the adventurer's=
 confident "crocodile whispering" gestures at the emu through the glass

The emu completely ignoring his=
 YouTube-inspired attempts

Quick cuts between heroic video=
 moments and the boy's ineffective mimicking

Then mum arrives and it's beautifully understated:

No dramatic music or heroic pos=

Just practical experience - may=

Simple, effective action that a=

This =

Oh that's even better! The ca=

Perfect! This is so much more powerful because:

The casual mastery
: She's not even focused on the emu - she's j=
ust coming home from work, arms full of everyday stuff, and handles this "c=
risis" as a minor inconvenience. That's what real competence looks like.

The teaching moment
: When he asks her to show him properly, it =
becomes about genuine mentorship vs. digital consumption. She can pass on a=
ctual skills and understanding, not just information.

Visual storytelling
: The contrast is incredible - him inside fr=
antically consuming content about how to be brave and capable, while she ju=
st... is brave and capable, without even thinking about it.
