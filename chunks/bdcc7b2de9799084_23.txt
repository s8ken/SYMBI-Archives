Discovery:
 query web for =E2=80=9Cself=E2=80=91reflect=
ion LLM safety bias neutrality,=E2=80=9D fetch top papers.

Acquisition:
 use 
scrape-webpage
 to capture full text (what you=E2=80=99re seei=
ng).

Feature extraction:
 mine claims, prompts, and metrics =
(TPR, TNR, accuracy deltas).

Design synthesis:
 propose archive schema fields (promp=
t text, model, task, metric set, date).

Evaluation plan:
 schedule A/B tests where 
generation =E2=86=92 reflection =E2=86=92=

ons.

What this does 
not
 prove (and how to confirm)

The artifact shows intent and evid=
ence, but not the 
entire
 tho=
ught chain. To confirm it was part of Ninja AI=E2=80=99s design/assessment =
loop, check:

Call provenance:
 which agent invoked 
scrape-webpage
 and under what task label=
.

Temporal linkage:
 timestamps around this call vs. comm=
its/edits to your archives schemas or safety prompts.

Write=E2=80=91backs:
 subsequent actions that 
used
 insights here (e.g., adding prom=
pt families, switching models, enabling cross=E2=80=91reflection).

If you have access to agent run lo=
gs, look for a sequence like:

search =E2=86=92 scrape-webpage=
(arxiv link) =E2=86=92 summarize/extract =E2=86=92 propose-archive-schema =
=E2=86=92 write:archives/config =E2=86=92 run:eval-batches
.

If the goal was to harden =E2=80=
=9Carchives,=E2=80=9D here=E2=80=99s the upgrade that falls out of this pap=
er

1) Reflection Prompt Registry

Store multiple vetted reflection p=
rompts per 
task x model
.

Track 
metric outcomes per prompt variant
 (TPR/TNR/accu=
racy/overblock rate).

Promote demoted prompts based on r=
olling performance, not intuition.

2) Cross=E2=80=91Model Critique Slot

Add an optional 
cross=E2=80=91reflection
 step (e.g., M=
odel=E2=80=91B reviews Model=E2=80=91A=E2=80=99s output) when safety or ide=
ology risk is detected.

Archive the 
critic rationale
 and final decision.

3) Decision Ledger

For every response: record 
original =E2=86=92 reflection =E2=86=
=92 final
, with 
reas=
on codes
 (=E2=80=9Cchanged due to X risk,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cretain=
ed after check,=E2=80=9D etc.) + metrics.

This gives you 
auditability
 and 
test=E2=80=91time scaling telemetry
.

4) Prompt Sensitivity Testing (PST) Harness

Nightly jobs that sample your live=
 tasks, rotate through reflection prompts, and write back comparative metri=
cs.

The archives become a 
living scoreboard
 of what works =

now
, not last month.

5) Context=E2=80=91Aware Safety

The paper shows models can over=E2=
=80=91block without full context. Always run safety checks on 
(instruction + output)
, not instr=
uction alone, and preserve that pairing in the archive.

Bottom line

Your suspicion is well=E2=80=91founded.
