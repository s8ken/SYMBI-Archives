-level + storage
 alignment:

Contract:
 Use model providers that explicitly honor 
data-logging/training opt-out
 for API traffic. Keep the DPA/SOW language.

Wire-level:
 Send the provider=E2=80=99s 
no-log / no-train headers
 (many of=
fer them) and include your 
pu=
rpose token
. Keep a cryptographic transcript of those headers in y=
our audit ledger.

Storage:
 Prefer 
self-hosted/open-weights
 for anything high-sensitivity, =
or run 
provider-managed VPC e=
ndpoints
 with logging disabled and 
no data retention
. Where possible, move safety/clas=
sification/reflection to 
loca=
l open-weights
 to avoid sending raw shards out at all.

Extra hardening for Symbi Resonat=
e

Outbound DLP at the proxy:
 block any request that cont=
ains >N tokens of contiguous raw transcript unless it=E2=80=99s the 
embedding
 path; allow on=
ly 
IDs
 and 
small snippets
 elsewhere.

Quarantine & canaries:
 embed invisible markers in =
shards; if a marker shows up in any unexpected place (vendor output, extern=
al storage), you=E2=80=99ve got proof of exfiltration.

=E2=80=9CTwo-man rule=E2=80=9D for export:
 exporting a=
 session summary requires human approval; the proxy enforces this via a sec=
ond short-lived approval token.

DSAR/Right-to-forget:
 because shards are first-class, =
deletion is precise: kill keys =E2=86=92 reindex drops embeddings =E2=86=92=
 ledger shows compliance.

What to change in your current la=
yout

Keep 
summarized_conversations/
 as the 
authoritative memory
 (encrypted at res=
t, classified).

Treat 
outputs/
 as 
ephemeral build artifacts
=E2=80=94store only in temp, auto-p=
urge on a rolling window, and 
never
 mix shards there.

Add a 

manifest.json=

 per conversation
 capturing: shard list, hashes, classifica=
tions, consent, retention, and 
=
no_train=3Dtrue
.

Put an 
egress.json policy
 next to your app that the pr=
oxy validates at runtime; the app can=E2=80=99t send traffic that isn=E2=80=
=99t declared there.

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll draft:

a minimal 
egress-proxy policy
 (OPA/Rego) with the purp=
ose-token schema, and

the 

manifest.json

 + shard encryption flow (Node snipp=
et) you can drop into Symbi Resonate.

Thought for 12s

Got it. For SYMBI Syner=
gy to offer a 
context bridge
 that=E2=80=99s shareable, auditable, and enterprise-grade secure, we e=
stablish 
explicit guarantees
 across write, read, share, revoke, and audit. Below is a concrete, i=
mplementable blueprint.

SYNERGY: Security + Auditability Co=
ntract

The seven assurances

Provenance
 =E2=80=93 every artifact has origin, agent, in=
puts, model, and policy.

Integrity
 =E2=80=93 hash-chained (Merkle) receipts + sign=
atures.

Confidentiality
 =E2=80=93 envelope encryption with 
customer-managed keys (CMK)
.=

Minimization
 =E2=80=93 smallest necessary snippet crosses=
 the bridge; never raw corpus by default.

Accountability
 =E2=80=93 immutable transparency log + hum=
an-readable receipts.

Revocability
 =E2=80=93 key-scoped shards + recall manifes=
ts; revocation is deterministic.

Verifiability
 =E2=80=93 proofs (hashes, signatures) are c=
heckable without trusting us.
