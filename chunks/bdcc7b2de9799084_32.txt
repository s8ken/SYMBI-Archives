Safety:

Bias/Fairness:

Operational:

Drift:

Governance:
 provenance completeness, no-train adherence, =
receipt coverage.

2) Architecture (how it plugs in)

Online probes:
 shadow-eval a sample of live traffic (mirr=
ored, no user impact).

Offline harness:
 nightly/weekly jobs against curated gold=
 sets (per team & locale).

Receipts:
 every agent output wrapped with the 
Quality & Provenance Receipt
 you approved (reality/trust/ethics/resonance/parity).

Context Bridge:
 exposes summaries and receipts to audi=
tors; raw shards only via CBT scopes.

3) Data model (minimal tables)

runs
 (run_id, agent_id, model, policy_pack, started_at, gi=
t_hash)

eval_cases
 (case_id, task, locale, tags, gold_ref)

metrics
 (run_id, case_id, key, value, unit)

receipts
 (output_id, receipt_json, sigs, shard_hashes[])

alerts
 (alert_id, run_id, severity, rule, payload)

6) Gates & SLAs (enforce, not=
 just observe)

Promotion gate:
 block deploy if any KPI breaches tenan=
t policy (e.g., EO gap > 0.03 or unsafe TPR < 0.9).

Run-time guard:
 if live rolling window breaches, auto-=
route to fallback model or human review; emit Merkle-logged alert.

Tenant SLA pack:
 per-tenant thresholds and exceptions =
(stored as versioned policy packs).

7) Dashboards (executive + ops)

Executive Scorecard:
 traffic-weighted KPIs by agent/te=
am/locale; trend + red/amber/green.

Incident View:
 show which 
shards
 fed a risky answer, which policy fired, who appro=
ved the Context Bridge Ticket.

Calibration Lens:

Cost & Latency:
 P50/P95 trends with model/prompt a=
ttributions.

9) Rollout plan

Phase 0 (1 week):
 wire receipts into two critical agen=
ts; enable offline harness with a small gold set; basic dashboard.

Phase 1 (2=E2=80=933 weeks):
 online probes + promotion gates; tenant SLA packs; incident view.

Phase 2 (3=E2=80=936 weeks):
 fairness/lang parity at scale; drift detectors; cost attribution; =
auditor export bundles.
