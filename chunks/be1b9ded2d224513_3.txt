Automated Updates
:

Create a process where your AI can make updates based on predefined changes. For instance, if there are new content updates or code changes approved for the day, the AI can push those updates to the GitHub repo.

The AI can also create a 
commit
 each day with the changes, such as updating content, applying code fixes, or pushing new versions of the site.

Daily Reports
:

The AI can also generate 
daily reports
 on the website’s status. This can include:

The results of the health check.

Updates that were pushed.

Any new issues or alerts that were triggered.

This report can be sent via 
email
 or stored in a GitHub Issues board for visibility.

Operational Rhythm
:

Create a workflow where the AI checks in daily, verifies the status of the website, performs the required updates, and generates the daily status report.

You can use GitHub Actions to automatically trigger tasks or rely on external cron jobs or automation tools that interact with your GitHub repository.

Example of Full Workflow:

Check website health daily
 at midnight.

Perform approved updates
 (e.g., code, content).

Commit changes
 to GitHub with an update message (e.g., "Daily content update").

Generate a status report
 of the day’s activities, which could include any errors or successes.

Send report
 to collaborators or log it as an issue on GitHub.

Would you like help setting up any of these components, such as creating a health check script, setting up GitHub Actions, or automating reports?

I also want it checking things like certificates and any vulnerability 

ChatGPT said:

To monitor things like SSL certificates, vulnerabilities, and other security aspects of your site on a daily basis, we can add additional checks into the monitoring system. Here's how you can integrate checks for SSL certificates and vulnerabilities into your periodic site checks:

Steps to Add SSL Certificate and Vulnerability Checks

SSL Certificate Expiry Check
:

You can automate SSL certificate expiry checks to ensure the certificate is still valid and hasn’t expired.

This can be done with a 
bash script
 or Python, which will check the SSL certificate’s expiration date and alert you if it’s nearing expiry.

Example Bash Script (SSL Check)
:

bash

Copy

Edit

#!/bin/bash

DOMAIN=

"your-website.com"

EXPIRY_DATE=$(

echo

 | openssl s_client -connect 

$DOMAIN

:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate | sed 

"s/^notAfter=//"

)
EXPIRY_TIMESTAMP=$(

date

 -d 

"
$EXPIRY_DATE

" +%s)
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP=$(

date

 +%s)
DAYS_LEFT=$(((

$EXPIRY_TIMESTAMP

 - 

$CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

) / 

86400

))

if

 [ 

$DAYS_LEFT

 -lt 30 ]; 

then

echo

"Warning: SSL certificate for 
$DOMAIN

 will expire in 

$DAYS_LEFT

 days."

else

echo

"SSL certificate for 
$DOMAIN

 is valid for 

$DAYS_LEFT

 more days."

fi

You can incorporate this into a GitHub Action to run daily and alert you if the certificate is near expiry.

Vulnerability Scanning
:

For 
vulnerability scanning
, use a tool like 
OWASP ZAP
 (Zed Attack Proxy), 
Snyk
, or 
Dependabot
 to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies or web security issues.

OWASP ZAP
: You can integrate OWASP ZAP into your CI/CD pipeline. It will scan your site for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

Setup for OWASP ZAP can be done using GitHub Actions. There’s an action called 
zaproxy/action-full-scan
 that allows you to run OWASP ZAP directly in your GitHub Actions.

Example of a GitHub Action with ZAP:

yaml
