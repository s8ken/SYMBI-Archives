This action will run ZAP against your website and produce a report of potential vulnerabilities.

Dependency Vulnerability Check (Using Snyk or Dependabot)
:

Dependabot
 is built into GitHub and can automatically scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It will raise pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies.

Snyk
 is another tool that can scan your dependencies and alert you to vulnerabilities in open-source libraries.

You can set up 
Snyk
 within your GitHub Actions to monitor your dependencies:

Automated Alerts and Reports
:

Once vulnerabilities or SSL certificate issues are detected, you’ll want your AI to generate a report and send notifications (either through email or GitHub issues).

For SSL checks, you can simply log the expiration status into a file and alert the team.

For vulnerability reports, either the 
OWASP ZAP
 or 
Snyk
 actions will generate detailed reports that you can send to your team.

Example Full Monitoring Workflow:

Health Check
: Verify website is up and running.

SSL Certificate Check
: Verify certificate is valid.

Vulnerability Scan
:

Use OWASP ZAP for web vulnerabilities.

Use Dependabot/Snyk to check for dependency vulnerabilities.

Daily Reports
: Compile results from all checks (e.g., SSL status, vulnerabilities) and generate a report. Store it as a GitHub issue or send it to a Slack/Email channel.

I'm pretty low code myself so trying to use lln only we also have vercel v0 building and housing first to production so git serves as more a repo backup i guess

Thanks for the clarification! Since you're using Vercel for production deployment and GitHub mainly as a repository backup, it sounds
