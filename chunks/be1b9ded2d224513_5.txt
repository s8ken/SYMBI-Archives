like you want a simple, low-code solution for monitoring your site, checking SSL certificates, and scanning for vulnerabilities without diving too deep into custom code.

Here’s how we can simplify things using low-code or no-code tools:

1. 
Website Monitoring with UptimeRobot (or similar)

UptimeRobot
 is a great tool for monitoring website uptime and SSL certificate status. You can set it to check the availability of your website at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

It can also alert you if the SSL certificate is about to expire, or if there are any downtime issues.

How to set up:

Go to 
UptimeRobot

 and create an account.

Set up a new monitor for your website (you’ll need to input the URL of your site).

Choose the type of monitoring (HTTP(s) for your website).

Set up email or Slack notifications for alerts on downtime or certificate expiry.

Advantages
:

No coding
 required.

You'll get automatic notifications for downtime and certificate issues.

2. 
Vulnerability Scanning with Snyk (Low-Code Integration)

Snyk
 offers a straightforward, low-code solution for scanning your codebase for vulnerabilities, especially if you're using dependencies (like npm packages or other libraries).

You can integrate Snyk directly with your GitHub repo or Vercel to monitor your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

How to Set Up:

Go to 
Snyk

, sign up, and link your GitHub repository.

Snyk will automatically scan your dependencies and alert you to any vulnerabilities.

You can also link it to your Vercel account to get notifications about any issues with your deployment.

Advantages
:

No custom coding
 needed.

Snyk will automatically monitor and provide vulnerability reports.

3. 
Automating Deployment Monitoring (Vercel and GitHub Integration)

Vercel handles the deployment, so once your changes are pushed to GitHub, Vercel will take care of building and deploying the site.

You can configure 
Vercel’s GitHub integration
 to automatically deploy changes from the main branch. Additionally, you can monitor your deployments directly from Vercel’s dashboard.

How to set up:

Link your GitHub repository to Vercel.

Every time a change is pushed to GitHub (e.g., through your low-code platform or directly), Vercel will automatically build and deploy it to production.

Vercel also provides insights on performance, errors, and analytics, which can help in monitoring your site’s health without writing any code.

Advantages
:

Automatic deployments
 and 
monitoring
 from the Vercel dashboard.

You can get real-time logs and performance insights without needing code.

4. 
Daily Updates and Monitoring (Slack or Email Notifications)

You can use 
Zapier
 to integrate 
UptimeRobot
 or 
Snyk
 with 
Slack
 or 
email
 for daily or on-demand reports.

For example, if UptimeRobot detects an issue or Snyk finds a vulnerability, it can send a Slack message or email to alert you.

How to set up with Zapier:

Create a Zap that connects 
UptimeRobot
 or 
Snyk
 to 
Slack
 or 
email
.

Configure Zapier to send updates like:

"Your website is down!"

"Your SSL certificate will expire in 5 days."

"New vulnerability detected in a dependency."

Advantages
:

Low-code integration
.

Get 
real-time notifications
 and keep your team informed.

5. 
Vercel Logs and Performance Insights

You can monitor your website’s performance directly within 
Vercel
 using its built-in features:

View 
build logs
 to understand any deployment issues.

Use 
Vercel Analytics
 to monitor real-time performance, traffic, and errors.

How to set up
:

After each deployment, go to your Vercel dashboard.

Check the 
Analytics
 section for insights into performance and errors.

No code required
, just use the dashboard.

Summary
:

UptimeRobot
 for website uptime and SSL certificate monitoring.

Snyk
 for vulnerability scanning of dependencies.

Vercel's native features
 for monitoring deployments and performance.

Zapier
 for easy email or Slack alerts about issues.
