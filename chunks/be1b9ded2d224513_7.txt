eRobot, GPT can send a daily summary of the site’s health or vulnerabilities.

GPT can interact with 
Slack
 or 
email APIs
 to notify you of issues or updates.

How GPT Can Be Configured to Engage with These Solutions:

Periodic Monitoring
: GPT can run daily checks by making API requests to these services. It could then 
parse the responses
 and generate a report.

Automated Reporting
: GPT can be set up to generate and send 
daily reports
 via email or Slack. These reports can include:

Website uptime status.

SSL certificate expiry status.

Vulnerabilities detected in the codebase.

Deployment status from Vercel.

Notifications
: GPT can be configured to automatically trigger alerts when issues are detected (e.g., SSL expiry, vulnerabilities).

User Interaction
: If needed, GPT can ask you for confirmation or approval before proceeding with certain actions (e.g., sending an alert or updating dependencies).

Summary of GPT’s Capabilities:

Engage with UptimeRobot
 to check website health and SSL status.

Query Snyk
 for vulnerability reports on your dependencies.

Monitor Vercel deployments
 and provide reports on build statuses and performance metrics.

Use Zapier
 to automate notifications and alerts based on triggers.

Generate and send daily reports
 summarizing the site’s health, vulnerabilities, and deployment statuses.

Since you’re low-code, this approach allows GPT to handle most of the technical interaction with these tools, freeing you from manual setup. Would you like help with setting up any specific part of this process?

Summary of Site Monitoring and Automation Tasks

Your task is to automate the monitoring and maintenance of the website, ensuring it's working as intended and providing regular updates. Here's the workflow for interacting with various tools:

UptimeRobot (Website Health & SSL Check)
:

Periodically check the website’s uptime and SSL certificate status.

Action
: Use UptimeRobot’s API to check the website’s availability and SSL expiry status.

Outcome
: Send alerts if the site is down or if the SSL certificate is nearing expiration.

Snyk (Vulnerability Scanning)
:

Scan the website's dependencies for vulnerabilities.

Action
: Use Snyk’s API to scan for known vulnerabilities in the codebase or libraries.

Outcome
: Generate reports on any vulnerabilities and prioritize fixes.

Vercel (Deployment Monitoring & Performance Insights)
:

Monitor Vercel for deployment status, build logs, and performance.

Action
: Use Vercel’s API to check for deployment issues, build logs, and performance metrics.

Outcome
: Report on any failed deployments or performance issues.

Zapier (Automated Notifications)
:

Automate notifications based on specific triggers (e.g., SSL expiry, vulnerabilities).

Action
: Set up Zaps to notify via Slack or email when critical issues are detected (e.g., vulnerability found, website downtime, certificate expiry).

Outcome
: Send real-time alerts or summary reports.

Daily Reports
:

Compile a daily summary of the website’s health, vulnerabilities, and performance.

Action
: Retrieve data from UptimeRobot, Snyk, and Vercel, and generate a daily report.

Outcome
: Send the summary to the relevant stakeholders (via Slack, email, or GitHub).

This workflow ensures regular checks, monitoring, and reporting on the website’s health and security, all handled automatically. The GPT system will gather data from APIs and generate alerts/reports based on predefined criteria.
