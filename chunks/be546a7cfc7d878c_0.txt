I want to login to vercel

Got you. Here are the two quickest ways to log in to Ver=
cel=E2=80=94pick whichever suits how you work.

1) Log in via browser (fastest)

Go to 
https://vercel.com/login

Choose your provider:

GitHub
 (usually simplest if your repos are on GitHub), or=

Email
 =E2=86=92 enter your email and click the magic-link=
 Vercel sends you.

You=E2=80=99re in. If you=E2=80=99re=
 in multiple teams, click your avatar =E2=86=92 
Switch Team
 to pick the right scope.

2) Log in via the CLI (great for de=
ploying)

Use whichever runner you prefer:

With Bun (since you use it):

b=
ash

Copy code

bunx vercel login

With Node/npm:

b=
ash

Copy code

npm i -g vercel        

# one-time install

vercel login

or just:

b=
ash

Copy code

npx vercel login

Then:

b=
ash

Copy code

vercel

# deploy w=
hen you're ready

Handy tips

Wrong account/scope?

vercel switch
 to change team/org.

Stuck?

vercel =
logout
 then log in again.

No magic link email?
 Check spam, then request a new li=
nk.

If you tell me whether you want 
browser
 or 
CLI
 (and which project folder you=E2=80=99re in), I=E2=80=99=
ll walk you through the exact next commands.
