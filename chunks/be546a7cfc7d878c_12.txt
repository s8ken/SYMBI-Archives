Revised Assessment with Figma Metrics
The Figma results provide scores for Reality Index, Trust Protocol, Ethical=
 Alignment, Resonance, and Canvas Parity, alongside word counts and timesta=
mps. These align with the initial Perplexity report (e.g., 9.0 Reality Inde=
x, 4.8/5 Ethical Alignment) but show slight improvements (e.g., Reality Ind=
ex up to 9.4 in =E2=80=9Coauth_token_log_analysis.html=E2=80=9D) and more g=
ranularity (e.g., Ethical Alignment varies from 3/5 to 5/5). Below, I updat=
e the thematic analysis from the new artifacts, incorporating these metrics=
 and addressing your four key questions.
