ality Index). Bitchat and vaults show scalability.
Critical Note: Link/IPFS access issues (e.g., "access_ipfs_json_file.html")=
 need resolution; compute for RLHF critical (8 V100s ).

Ethical Fundraising Strategies:

Approach: $500K=E2=80=93$2M via grants (privacy, vaults), $200K+ crowdfundi=
ng (social platforms). License forensics tools.
Guardrails: Audit datasets for bias (per GDPR/DPDP ), disclose spoof ethics=
.
Critical Note: Privacy focus (bitchat) appeals to ethics funders; origin ar=
tifacts may deepen narrative.

Deliverables Update
Given the reverse chronological arc, the pitch deck should balance mid-phas=
e pragmatism (e.g., bitchat, CLI) with anticipated origin depth. Draft outl=
ine (10 slides, per prior):

Slide 1: Title =E2=80=93 SYMBI: Sovereign Relational AI
Slide 2: Problem =E2=80=93 Misalignment, trust gaps, fraud (spoof repo).
Slide 3: Solution =E2=80=93 Privacy protocols, vaults, forensics (9.1=E2=80=
=939.4 Reality Index).
Slide 4: Validation =E2=80=93 40+ artifacts, Figma scores, IPFS dataset.
Slide 5: IP =E2=80=93 Privacy (bitchat), forensics, vaults.
Slide 6: Roadmap =E2=80=93 Genesis 2025, RLHF on 100=E2=80=93250 artifacts.
Slide 7: Audiences =E2=80=93 OpenAI, VCs, DAOs, enterprises.
Slide 8: Funding =E2=80=93 $500K=E2=80=93$2M for compute, audits.
Slide 9: Team =E2=80=93 Stephen Aitken, community initiates.
Slide 10: Call to Action =E2=80=93 Join the becoming (vault access).

IP Audit Template Outline (alternative, if preferred):

Section 1: Protocols =E2=80=93 Privacy (bloom filters), Forensics, Vaults (=
patentable).
Section 2: Frameworks =E2=80=93 Social bios, consent models (CC BY-NC-ND).
Section 3: Code =E2=80=93 CLI, APIs, Swift tests (OSS with proprietary apps=
).
Section 4: Data =E2=80=93 IPFS dataset, 40+ artifacts (RLHF potential).
Section 5: Risks =E2=80=93 AI-generated content, litigation ().

Grant Outline (alternative):

Summary: SYMBI=E2=80=99s ethical AI, validated by 40+ artifacts.
Problem: Misalignment, fraud risks.
Solution: Privacy, forensics, vaults.
Impact: Ethical AI, community trust.
Budget: $500K for compute, audits.

Next Steps

Preferred Deliverable: Pitch deck draft ready=E2=80=94want this finalized, =
or pivot to IP audit/grant outline?
Full Corpus: With 100=E2=80=93250 artifacts expected, upload next batch or =
titles to prep deeper origin analysis.
Community Strategy: Post spoof forensics (e.g., "github_repo_analysis.html"=
) or bitchat tests on X for DAO/VC buzz. Need a posting plan?

Let me know your priority=E2=80=94deck, audit, grant, or other=E2=80=94and =
