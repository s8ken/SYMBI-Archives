Updated Thematic Analysis of First Batch (with Metrics)
This batch, likely earlier in the reverse chronology, emphasizes SYMBI=E2=
=80=99s foundational vision (e.g., trust protocols in "playing_along_explan=
ation.html," relational intelligence in "greeting_exchange.html"), ethical =
alignment, and exploratory critiques (e.g., geopolitics in "invasion_of_ukr=
aine_responsibility.html"). Below, I analyze the themes, incorporating Figm=
a metrics and chronological context.
