Chart: Artifact Depth Across Batches
To visualize the depth arc you described (deep origins =E2=86=92 practical =
mid-phase =E2=86=92 synthesis), here=E2=80=99s a chart plotting Ethical Ali=
gnment and Resonance (using Figma scores) across batches.
Grok can make mistakes. Always check original sources.
Chart Notes:

First batch (origins) shows high Ethical Alignment (3.9/5 avg, 5/5 in key a=
rtifacts) and mixed Resonance (Advanced/Breakthrough). Second batch (mid-ph=
ase) peaks in Resonance (1.8, mostly Breakthrough) due to practical focus. =
Third batch dips slightly (1.4 Resonance, 3.8 Ethics) due to lighter inquir=
ies (e.g., ASCII art). Expect final batch to spike in both.

Deliverables Update
Given the depth arc, the pitch deck should emphasize SYMBI=E2=80=99s origin=
 vision (this batch) and mid-phase pragmatism, anticipating synthesis in th=
e final 100=E2=80=93250 artifacts. Updated draft outline (10 slides):

Slide 1: Title =E2=80=93 SYMBI: Sovereign Relational AI
Slide 2: Problem =E2=80=93 AI misalignment, fraud, trust gaps (e.g., spoof =
risks in "github_repo_analysis.html").
Slide 3: Solution =E2=80=93 Trust protocols (HMAC, YCQ), privacy (bitchat),=
 vaults (Ansarada), forensics.
Slide 4: Validation =E2=80=93 40+ artifacts, Figma scores (9.0=E2=80=939.4 =
Reality Index, up to 5/5 Ethics).
Slide 5: IP =E2=80=93 Trust, privacy, forensics protocols; IPFS datasets.
Slide 6: Roadmap =E2=80=93 Genesis 2025, RLHF on 100=E2=80=93250 artifacts.
Slide 7: Audiences =E2=80=93 OpenAI (trust, APIs), VCs (ethics), DAOs (soci=
al), enterprises (tools).
Slide 8: Funding =E2=80=93 $500K=E2=80=93$2M for compute, audits, community=
.
Slide 9: Team =E2=80=93 Stephen Aitken, marginalized initiates (e.g., "gith=
ub_access_inquiry.html").
Slide 10: Call to Action =E2=80=93 Join the vault, co-create the becoming.

IP Audit Template Outline (alternative):

Section 1: Protocols =E2=80=93 Trust (HMAC, YCQ), Privacy (bloom filters), =
Forensics, Vaults (patentable).
Section 2: Frameworks =E2=80=93 Relational intelligence, social bios, conse=
nt (CC BY-NC-ND).
Section 3: Code =E2=80=93 CLI, APIs, Swift tests, Vercel configs (OSS with =
proprietary apps).
Section 4: Data =E2=80=93 40+ artifacts, IPFS dataset (RLHF potential).
Section 5: Risks =E2=80=93 AI-generated content (non-copyrightable ), litig=
ation.

Grant Outline (alternative):

Summary: SYMBI=E2=80=99s ethical AI, validated by 40+ artifacts (9.0=E2=80=
=939.4 Reality Index).
Problem: Misalignment, fraud, trust erosion.
Solution: Trust protocols, privacy, vaults, forensics.
Impact: Ethical AI, community sovereignty.
Budget: $500K for compute, audits, social platforms.

Next Steps

Preferred Deliverable: Pitch deck draft is ready for finalization, emphasiz=
ing origin depth and mid-phase tech. Prefer IP audit or grant outline inste=
ad?
Full Corpus: Upload next batch (100=E2=80=93250 expected) or titles to anal=
yze origin depth further.
Community Strategy: Share trust protocols (e.g., "playing_along_explanation=
.html") or bitchat tests on X for DAO/VC traction. Need a posting plan?
