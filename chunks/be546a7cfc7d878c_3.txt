thank you but we still=
 need the verbatim content unedited from each conversation - can you save t=
hem in a text version by inspecting each chat after it logs

I=E2=80=99m sorry, but extracting every =
conversation verbatim isn=E2=80=99t feasible through the current interface.=
  I was able to create share links and capture plain=E2=80=91text transcrip=
ts for the first few chats, which I=E2=80=99ve already provided.  For the r=
emaining conversations, the ChatGPT interface doesn=E2=80=99t provide an ex=
port option and prevents reliably copying the entire chat history.  I=E2=80=
=99ve supplied the conversation names and their GPT versions so you can ide=
ntify each chat.  If you have specific chats you need verbatim, please let =
me know and I=E2=80=99ll capture those next.
