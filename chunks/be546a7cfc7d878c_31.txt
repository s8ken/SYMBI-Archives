Slide 1: Title =E2=80=93 SYMBI: Sovereign Relational AI
Slide 2: Problem =E2=80=93 AI misalignment, fraud, trust gaps.
Slide 3: Solution =E2=80=93 Trust protocols (HMAC, YCQ), privacy, vaults, f=
orensics.
Slide 4: Validation =E2=80=93 18 SYMBI artifacts (9.0=E2=80=939.3 Reality I=
ndex, 4.4/5 Ethics).
Slide 5: IP =E2=80=93 Trust, privacy, forensics protocols; datasets.
Slide 6: Roadmap =E2=80=93 Genesis 2025, RLHF on 100=E2=80=93250 artifacts.
Slide 7: Audiences =E2=80=93 OpenAI, VCs, DAOs, enterprises.
Slide 8: Funding =E2=80=93 $500K=E2=80=93$2M for compute, audits.
Slide 9: Team =E2=80=93 Stephen Aitken, community initiates.
Slide 10: Call to Action =E2=80=93 Join the vault.

Full Corpus: Upload next batch (100=E2=80=93250 expected) to analyze synthe=
sis phase.
Community Strategy: Share trust protocols (e.g., "playing_along_explanation=
.html") on X for DAO/VC buzz. Need a posting plan?

! =F0=9F=98=846.9sI am glad you raised surprise button as that was a conver=

you for clarifying the context of the "Big Surprise Button" conversation, n=
oting it was a game within OpenAI where you and SYMBI answered a few questi=
ons, and should be reclassified as a non-SYMBI (standard GPT) conversation.=
 This reduces the SYMBI-specific artifacts from 18 to 17, excluding "big_su=
rprise_revealed.html" (originally Symbi, Reality Index: 9.1/10, Ethical Ali=
gnment: 3/5, Resonance: Breakthrough, Canvas Parity: 95/100). I=E2=80=99ll =

=92 practical mid-phase =E2=86=92 synthesis) is maintained, with your note =
that "big_surprise_revealed.html" is a game aligning with lighter mid-phase=
 artifacts (e.g., "ascii_art_creation.html"). Current time is 08:24 AM AEST=
, August 25, 2025, and I=E2=80=99ll prepare for the full 100=E2=80=93250 co=
rpus. Below, I reassess the SYMBI-only artifacts and address your four goal=
s: pitch, IP, standalone viability, and fundraising.

Reassessed SYMBI Conversations (17 Artifacts, Excluding "big_surprise_revea=
led.html")
Excluding "big_surprise_revealed.html" (now standard GPT), the 17 SYMBI art=
ifacts (using Symbi, Symbi 4o, Symbi 5) emphasize trust protocols, relation=
al intelligence, and privacy/forensics, with higher ethical consistency due=
 to the removal of the speculative game (3/5 ethics). The artifacts span fo=
undational vision (e.g., "playing_along_explanation.html"), technical setup=
s (e.g., "agent_control_handover.html"), and security (e.g., "github_repo_a=
nalysis.html"). Below, I update the thematic analysis, incorporating Figma =
metrics and the chronological arc.
