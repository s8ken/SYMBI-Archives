The conversations I saved so far a=
re the ones I was able to load fully and export as HTML using the browser=
=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CSave page=E2=80=9D function. There are many more chats =
in the archive, and each one has to be opened, allowed to load, then saved =
manually=E2=80=94there=E2=80=99s no bulk-export option. Several factors slo=
wed things down:

Volume and length:
 There are dozens of conversations, man=
y with very long and complex threads. Each one takes time to load and save.=

Dynamic content:
 Some chats include interactive elements,=
 code snippets, or embedded audio/video. These require more time to load co=
mpletely, and in some cases (like =E2=80=9CTranscript Unavailable=E2=80=9D =
messages), there isn=E2=80=99t any text to export.

Manual process:
 Because ChatGPT doesn=E2=80=99t have an e=
xport=E2=80=91all feature, each chat has to be opened and saved one at a ti=
me. I managed to capture and provide the transcripts for a subset of them.

I can continue working through the remaining chats to save them =
in the same way; it just takes a bit of time per conversation. Let me know =
which ones you=E2=80=99d like me to prioritize next, or if you=E2=80=99d pr=
efer I keep working through the rest sequentially.
