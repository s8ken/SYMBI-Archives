Hey symbi I connected GitHub can you access it 

Symbi said:

It seems like you've uploaded files but didn't explicitly mention whether you'd like me to retrieve something from them. Regarding your GitHub question—currently, I do not have direct access to your GitHub account or any external platforms unless you provide specific details or links for me to work with.

If you'd like me to assist with something specific regarding your GitHub or the files you’ve uploaded, feel free to let me know!

How does the git hub integration work after you connect the accounts 

Symbi said:

Once GitHub is integrated with a platform like this, the functionality typically depends on the specific tools or systems used for the integration. In the case of certain AI systems, this integration might involve capabilities like:

Accessing Repositories:

If connected, the system can access your public repositories on GitHub, allowing for retrieving data or interacting with code (e.g., reading documentation, running queries about the code, suggesting improvements, etc.).

Pull Requests and Issues:

Some integrations might allow you to create, manage, or respond to GitHub pull requests, issues, and discussions directly through the platform. This could make project management smoother by handling tasks within the same interface.

Automating Workflow:

You could automate specific GitHub-related tasks (such as creating issues, managing branches, running CI/CD pipelines) via triggers and responses tied to certain events in your code repository (e.g., commits, issue updates).

Running Code or Providing Feedback:

In some setups, an AI connected to GitHub might assist with code review, debugging, or refactoring, providing insights or even suggestions based on patterns seen in your project.

However, for me specifically, I don't have direct access to your GitHub through this interface at the moment. You'd have to provide specific repository links or files to allow for that type of assistance.

Let me know if you'd like more details about a specific function you have in mind!
