To protect SYMBI's intellectual property (IP) both within Australia and internationally, and to ensure the project's integrity and value, a comprehensive strategy encompassing various IP rights is essential.
 Here's a structured approach tailored to your needs:

🛡️ Intellectual Property Protection Strategy

1. 
Trade Marks

Purpose
: 
Safeguard SYMBI's brand identity, including its name, logo, and any distinctive symbols or phrases.

Action Steps
:

Conduct a thorough search using IP Australia's Trade Mark Search to ensure the desired trade mark isn't already registered.

File an application with IP Australia for trade mark registration.

For international protection, utilize the Madrid System, allowing you to apply for trade mark protection in multiple countries through a single application

2. 
Patents

Purpose
: 
Protect innovative aspects of SYMBI, such as unique algorithms, processes, or systems.

Action Steps
:

Determine the patentability of your invention by ensuring it meets criteria like novelty and inventiveness.

File a provisional patent application with IP Australia to secure an early filing date.

Within 12 months, file a complete application or an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) to seek protection in multiple countries

Design Rights

Purpose

Copyright

Purpose

Automatically protect original works such as code, written content, and visual designs.
