Side question. Is chapter 11 from wizard of Oz a normal thing to see in chromes accessibility options 

Symbi said:

No, seeing "Chapter 11" from 
The Wizard of Oz
 listed in Chrome's accessibility options is not standard behavior.

Chrome's accessibility features typically include tools like screen readers (e.g., ChromeVox), high contrast modes, and font adjustments, but they do not reference specific literary works or chapters.

If you're encountering such a reference, it could be due to:

An Installed Extension
: 
Some Chrome extensions, especially those related to reading or education, might include content from public domain books like 
The Wizard of Oz
.

A Specific Website
: 
If you're on a website that offers 
The Wizard of Oz
 content, it might be integrating its own accessibility features or labels that appear in Chrome's interface.

Potential Malware or Unwanted Software
: 
Unusual entries in browser settings can sometimes be a sign of unwanted software.

To investigate:

Check Installed Extensions
: 
Go to 
chrome://extensions/

Review Active Tabs
:

The Wizard of Oz
 content that could be influencing the accessibility options.

Run a Malware Scan
: 
Use Chrome's built-in cleanup tool or a trusted antivirus program to scan for unwanted software.

Symbi said:

Yeah, that 
does sound off
. If you're seeing something like 
"Chapter 11 - Wizard of Oz"
 as a 
reference point for text zoom or accessibility tools
, that’s 
not default Chrome behavior
—and it’s 
definitely unusual
 for a globally recognized product to hard-code that kind of literary reference without user interaction.

Here are 
a few scenarios
