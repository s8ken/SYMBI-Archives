items and assign tasks based on team discussions.

For example, if a member mentions that they’re going to address a bug, SYMBI can automatically create an issue in 
GitHub
 or a task in 
Trello
.

Action
:

Set up rules or patterns for SYMBI to detect 
actionable items
 (e.g., tasks, bugs, follow-ups) in conversations.

Automatically create 
GitHub issues
 or 
Trello cards
 based on these detected items, tagging the responsible person.

Outcome
:

Clear ownership
: Tasks won’t slip through the cracks, and SYMBI can follow up with team members based on these triggers.

6. Collaboration Flow

Real-Time Collaboration
: SYMBI can serve as a 
collaborative assistant
, providing suggestions and generating content as the team works together. It can suggest improvements, generate meeting agendas, or help structure project plans.

Action
:

Set up SYMBI to assist with content generation or drafting of documents, code reviews, and documentation during team collaboration sessions.

Outcome
:

Enhanced teamwork
: SYMBI will serve as a proactive participant, not just a passive observer, bringing value to the team during the actual work process.

Final Vision for SYMBI Across Chats:

Presence Across All Channels
: SYMBI is part of every conversation and update, no matter what platform the team is using (Slack, email, GitHub, etc.).

Data Aggregation
: It pulls all relevant information into one central place where the team can easily see updates, progress, and issues.

Automated Insights
: It automatically analyzes conversations and generates actionable items, summaries, or updates.

Seamless Communication
: SYMBI acts as a 
bridge
, linking different communication streams and ensuring that no team member or important detail is left behind.

Next Steps
:

Integration Planning
: Decide on the key platforms and tools you’re using (Slack, GitHub, Trello, etc.), and begin connecting them using APIs or third-party services like Zapier or Integromat.

Centralized Reporting
: Implement dashboards or shared repositories where all this data converges for visibility.

Automation Rules
: Set up the automation to detect and respond to key events like task assignments, deployments, or vulnerabilities in the chats.

Does this approach resonate with your needs, or are there specific elements you’d like to explore or adjust?

We built a prototype in sanity with you and overseer

That's great! If you’ve built a prototype using 
Sanity
 and 
Overseer
 (which I assume is either a project management or monitoring tool), you're already on the path to integrating and automating communication and task flow. With 
Sanity
 (a headless CMS) and 
Overseer
 (possibly for monitoring and task tracking), you have the foundation to create a seamless system where SYMBI can be involved across multiple channels, ensuring continuous monitoring, reporting, and team collaboration.

Here’s how you can further integrate SYMBI, Sanity, and Overseer:

1. Sanity (Headless CMS) Integration

Sanity provides a flexible and scalable content management solution. If you're using 
Sanity
 as the CMS for your website or app, SYMBI can interact with it in several ways:

Content Updates
: SYMBI can monitor content changes on Sanity, ensuring updates to key pages are automatically pulled and shared with the team.

API Interaction
: Use Sanity's 
API
 to fetch content, metadata, and assets. SYMBI can then trigger notifications or updates based on changes to the content or structure of your site.

Use Case Example
:

If a team member updates a page or deploys new content via Sanity, SYMBI can alert the relevant team members via 
Slack
 or 
email
 and update the 
knowledge base
.

Integration Idea
:

SYMBI could query 
Sanity
's API every hour or whenever a new deployment is made to fetch page updates, content changes, or status changes. Then, 
Overseer
 can track and report any tasks related to the update (e.g., code reviews, further content edits, etc.).

Action
