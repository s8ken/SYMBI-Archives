Since you noticed it 
only when connecting the TV as an extended display but not the monitor
, the most likely causes are:

AirPlay-Related Activity
: macOS may be treating the TV as a wireless or AirPlay-enabled display rather than a standard HDMI connection.

HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection)
: Some TVs behave differently than monitors when connected via HDMI.

Screen Recording Permissions
: Certain apps or services might detect the TV connection as an event that allows recording.

Steps to Investigate

1. Check Display Connection Type

Go to 
System Settings > Displays
 and see if the TV is listed under "AirPlay Display" or as a direct HDMI/USB-C connection.

2. Check for Active AirPlay or Screen Sharing

Open 
Control Center
 (top-right of macOS menu bar).

Look for an 
AirPlay icon
 or an indicator under 
Screen Mirroring
.

If active, disable it and see if the purple indicator disappears.

3. Check System Logs for Any Recording Events

Since you have security concerns, let's verify if any recording event was triggered.

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.screencapture"'

 --info --last 5m

This will display any 
screen recording or screenshot activity
 in the last 5 minutes. Let me know if anything unusual shows up.

4. Check Accessibility Features

Go to 
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
.

Look for any 
unfamiliar apps
 under 
Screen Recording or Accessibility
 that might be triggering this.

5. Check for Running Background Apps

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i screen

This will show any 
background processes related to screen capture, screen mirroring, or sharing
.

Next Steps

If AirPlay is involved, we can check logs to see if it was auto-enabled.

If an unknown app is triggering this, we can investigate further.

If nothing appears in logs, it might be related to TV firmware settings.

Let me know what you find!

it doesn't say either airplay display or direct

That's unusual. If macOS isn't explicitly labeling the TV as either an 
AirPlay display
 or a 
direct HDMI connection
, we should investigate further. Let's break this down step by step.

1. Check Display Connection Details via Terminal

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to list all connected displays and their attributes:

sh

Copy

Edit

system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType

Look for your TV in the output. It should provide details such as:

Connection type
 (e.g., HDMI, USB-C, or AirPlay)

Resolution and refresh rate

Mirroring status

If the connection isn't listed clearly, let me know what the output shows.

2. Check if AirPlay or Sidecar is Running in the Background

To see if your Mac is treating the TV as an AirPlay or Sidecar device, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 com.apple.airplay

If AirPlay settings show up, your TV might be triggering an 
AirPlay-like connection
 instead of a standard HDMI display.

To check if Sidecar (macOS feature for extending displays wirelessly) is active, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 com.apple.sidecar

If anything appears, macOS might be using Sidecar-like behavior instead of HDMI.

3. Check for Recording or Screen Sharing Services

Since the 
purple indicator
 often relates to screen recording or sharing, let's check running services:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|Sidecar|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

Look for any suspicious processes running, especially:

AirPlay-related services

Sidecar processes

VNC (remote desktop)

Screen recording apps

If something unexpected appears, let me know.

4. Check If the TV Uses HDCP (Digital Content Protection)

Some 
smart TVs use HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection)
, which can affect how macOS interacts with them. If your TV has settings related to 
HDCP, HDMI security, or content protection
, try 
disabling them
 and reconnecting.

5. Confirm if macOS Recognizes the Display as Trusted

Run:

sh

Copy
