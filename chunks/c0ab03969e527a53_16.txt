 -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

This will 
stop AirPlayUIAgent from running under your user account.

After running that, check if 
the purple AirPlay icon disappears
 from the menu bar.

Let me know what happens before we continue!

Good! Since the command ran without errors, 
AirPlayUIAgent

should now be disabled
.

Step 9: Check If the AirPlay Icon Disappeared

Look at the 
menu bar
 (top right of your screen).

Is the purple AirPlay icon gone?

If 
it’s still there
, the process might still be running.

Step 10: Kill the Running AirPlay Processes

Now, let's 
force stop any remaining AirPlay processes
:

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent AirPlayXPCHelper

This will 
immediately stop
 both processes.

Let me know if the AirPlay icon disappears after this!

AirPlay is Still Running – Something is Persisting It

Since we 
disabled

AirPlayUIAgent
, 
killed the processes
, and 
it’s still running
, something 
deep in the system is forcing it back on.

We need to 
trace what’s reactivating AirPlay
 at the system level.

Step 11: Check If AirPlay is Running as a Root System Process

Since 
launchctl disable
 didn’t stop it, let’s check if 
macOS is restarting it as a system service.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i airplay

This will tell us if 
macOS is running AirPlay as a protected system service, which we need to disable differently.

Let me know the output before we move forward!

Findings: AirPlayXPCHelper is Running as a Root System Process

Your output confirms that 

com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
 is running at the system level (
sudo launchctl list
)
, which means 
macOS is restarting it as a protected system service
.

Since 
disabling the user-level service didn’t work
, we now need to 
disable it at the system level.

🚨 Step 12: Disable AirPlayXPCHelper at the System Level

Since 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 is running under root privileges, we need to 
disable it system-wide
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

🔹 
This prevents macOS from restarting AirPlayXPCHelper.

After running this, 
reboot your Mac
 and check if:

The 
purple AirPlay icon is gone
.

AirPlayXPCHelper

stays disabled
 after restart.

Check If AirPlay is Still Running After Reboot

Once your Mac reboots, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

If 
nothing appears
, AirPlay is finally disabled. If it 
still runs
, we’ll have to investigate deeper persistence methods.

Let me know 
if AirPlay stays disabled after the reboot!

AirPlay is Still Running – We Need to Dig Deeper

Since we've disabled 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 at the system level and it's still 
persisting
, something is 
forcing it to restart against system settings.

This suggests 
either:

A hidden system process is keeping it alive

A network-based trigger is reactivating it

Persistence from malware or unauthorized access

🚨 Step 13: Check If Another Process is Restarting AirPlay

Let’s check what 
other services are linked to AirPlay
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -iUDP | grep -i airplay

🔹 This will list 
any network connections related to AirPlay
, showing if something 
on your network is triggering AirPlay.

🚨 Step 14: Check System-Wide Launch Services

Since AirPlay is being 
forced on
, we need to check 
all system services
.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i apple

🔹 This will show 
all protected system services
, helping us see if 
AirPlay is being controlled by another system daemon.
