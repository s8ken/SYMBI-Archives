ioreg -lw0 | grep -i 

"display"

This will show 
low-level system information
 about connected displays. Let me know if it 
fails to list your TV properly
 or if something unexpected appears.

Next Steps

If the TV is 
detected differently
 than your monitor, it might be using AirPlay-like protocols instead of HDMI.

If a 
background recording service
 is running, we can investigate and shut it down.

If HDCP or another security mechanism is involved, we can tweak TV settings.

Try these steps and share what you find!

Got it! Let's take it one step at a time.

Step 1: Check Display Connection Type

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to see how macOS is detecting your TV:

sh

Copy

Edit

system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType

Let me know what it says under 
Displays
—specifically, whether it lists your TV as an 
external display, AirPlay device, or something else.

Great! Your 
Panasonic-TV
 is listed as a 
standard external display
, not an AirPlay device. This means macOS recognizes it as a direct connection (likely via HDMI or USB-C to HDMI).

Since it is 
not detected as an AirPlay display
, the 
purple indicator
 appearing suggests something else is happening.

Step 2: Check for AirPlay, Screen Sharing, or Screen Recording Services

Let's check if any background 
AirPlay, screen sharing, or screen recording services
 are running.

Run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

This will list any processes related to:

AirPlay

Screen Sharing

Screen Recording

VNC (Remote Desktop)

Let me know what it shows!

pipe dquote> 

ChatGPT said:

It looks like the command got cut off or didn't execute properly. Let's try again.

Step 2: Run the Full Command Again

Copy and paste this into 
Terminal
, then press 
Enter
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

Let me know what the output shows!

You said:

its weird when I ran that first command I get stuck with this

ChatGPT said:

That 
"pipe dquote>"
 prompt means the command was cut off and the Terminal is waiting for more input. This usually happens when there's an 
unfinished quotation mark
 or an incomplete command.

To 
exit that stuck state
, simply press:

sh

Copy

Edit

Ctrl + C

This will cancel the command and return you to a normal prompt.

Then, try running the command again 
exactly as written
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

Let me know what the output is!
