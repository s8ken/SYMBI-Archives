being modified, even by an admin. That’s why we got:

"Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged"

This means 
AirPlayXPCHelper is protected by SIP
, and macOS is 
forcing it to stay enabled
.

⚡ Next Steps: Two Possible Solutions

Now, we have 
two options
 depending on how far you want to go:

1️⃣ 
(Safer)
 Disable AirPlay Another Way

Instead of disabling the daemon, we can block its functionality using system permissions.

This method 
keeps SIP enabled
 and avoids modifying core macOS files.

2️⃣ 
(Advanced)
 Disable SIP Temporarily to Fully Remove AirPlayXPCHelper

This requires 
booting into macOS Recovery Mode
 and turning off SIP.

This allows us to 
permanently disable or remove AirPlayXPCHelper
.

After that, we can 
turn SIP back on
 to keep system security intact.

Option 1: Block AirPlay Using File Permissions (Safer)

Instead of disabling AirPlayXPCHelper, we 
block it from running
 by changing its permissions.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

🔹 This 
prevents AirPlayXPCHelper from executing
, stopping it from running while keeping SIP enabled.

Then 
restart your Mac
 and check if:

✅ The 
purple AirPlay icon disappears

✅ AirPlayXPCHelper 
no longer runs
 (
ps aux | grep -i airplay
)

Option 2: Temporarily Disable SIP to Fully Remove AirPlayXPCHelper (Advanced)

If you want to 
completely remove AirPlayXPCHelper
, you must 
disable SIP
 first.

Steps:

Restart your Mac and enter macOS Recovery Mode

Hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 during startup until you see the Apple logo.

Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities > Terminal
 in the top menu.

Disable SIP by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

This turns off System Integrity Protection.

Restart your Mac normally.

Now disable AirPlayXPCHelper with:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

Restart into Recovery Mode again
 and 
turn SIP back on
 with:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Which Option Do You Want to Try?

✅ 
Option 1 (Safer):
 Block AirPlayXPCHelper by setting its file permissions to 
000
.

🚨 
Option 2 (Advanced):
 Disable SIP, remove AirPlay, and re-enable SIP.

Let me know which method you want to try, and I’ll guide you through it

Since 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is blocking all modifications
 to 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, 
we cannot disable it while SIP is active
.

🚨 Step 18: The Only Way to Fully Disable AirPlayXPCHelper

The only way to 
completely remove or disable AirPlayXPCHelper
 is to 
temporarily disable SIP
 in macOS Recovery Mode.

Since 
SIP is blocking everything
, we need to:

Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Turn off SIP

Remove or disable AirPlayXPCHelper

Turn SIP back on
 (to keep system security intact)

macOS Recovery Mode
.

2️⃣ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

In the 
macOS Utilities window
