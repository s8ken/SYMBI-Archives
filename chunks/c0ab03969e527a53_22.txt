Remove or Disable AirPlayXPCHelper

Once back in normal macOS, 
run these commands in Terminal:

1️⃣ Stop AirPlayXPCHelper Immediately

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

2️⃣ Make It Unusable

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

🔹 This 
prevents it from ever running again
.

3️⃣ Restart Your Mac

After running those commands, 
restart your Mac
 and check if 
AirPlay is finally gone
.

Step 20: Re-Enable SIP for Security

Once we confirm 
AirPlay is disabled
, we 
turn SIP back on
 for security.

1️⃣ Restart in Recovery Mode Again

Same as before: 
Turn off your Mac → Hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 while turning it on
.

2️⃣ Open Terminal & Re-Enable SIP

In Terminal, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Press 
Enter
.

You should see 
"Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection."

3️⃣ Restart Normally

Click 
Apple Menu > Restart
 and boot back into macOS.

Final Check: Verify AirPlay is Gone

After rebooting, 
run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears
, AirPlay is finally disabled.

🚨 
If it’s still running, we need to check deeper system files.

⚠️ Important Notes

This is the 
only way to fully disable AirPlayXPCHelper
, since 
SIP is actively protecting it.

Disabling SIP temporarily is safe 
as long as you turn it back on afterward
.

Let me know 
if AirPlay is finally gone after this!

ok before we do please check if any remote access is occuring

ChatGPT said:

Good idea! Before we proceed with disabling SIP and removing 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, let’s first check if 
any remote access is occurring
 on your system.

🚨 Step 1: Check for Active Remote Access Sessions

Run the following 
in Terminal
 to check for any active remote desktop, screen sharing, or SSH sessions.

1️⃣ Check for Screen Sharing or Remote Desktop (VNC)

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i screensharing

✅ 
If nothing appears
, then 
Screen Sharing is not active
.

🚨 
If something appears
, a remote session may be running.

2️⃣ Check If Remote Login (SSH) is Enabled

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

✅ 
If it says "Remote Login: Off"
, SSH is disabled.

🚨 
If it says "Remote Login: On"
, someone could have SSH access.

3️⃣ Check for Open Network Connections

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep -E 

'LISTEN|ESTABLISHED'

✅ 
This will list all open network connections
.

🚨 
Look for any unusual IP addresses or services running (especially on ports 22, 5900, or 3389).

🚨 Step 2: Check for Hidden Remote Access Services

4️⃣ Check for Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote

🚨 
If anything related to "ARD" (Apple Remote Desktop) appears, it means remote management is enabled.

5️⃣ Check If a Hidden User Is Logged In Remotely

sh

Copy

Edit

who

🚨 
If any unknown usernames appear, someone is logged in remotely.

Next Steps

Run these commands one at a time.

Tell me what results you get.

If remote access is detected, we’ll remove it before disabling SIP.

🚨 
If we find remote access, we will immediately cut it off.
 Let me know the results!
