revent AirPlayXPCHelper from running.

2️⃣ Restart & Confirm AirPlay is Gone

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally disabled.

🚨 Step 6: Re-Enable SIP for Security

Once we confirm 
AirPlay is gone
, we 
turn SIP back on
.

1️⃣ Restart in Recovery Mode Again

Shut down your Mac.

Hold 

Command (⌘) + R
 while turning it on
 to enter 
macOS Recovery Mode
.

2️⃣ Open Terminal & Re-Enable SIP

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

Press 
Enter
 after each command.

You should see 
"Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection."

3️⃣ Restart Normally

Click 
Apple Menu > Restart
 to boot back into macOS.

Final Check: Verify AirPlay is Gone

Once you’re back in macOS, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is permanently disabled.

⚠️ Important Notes

Disabling SIP & Authenticated Root temporarily is the only way to modify protected system files.

You must re-enable SIP afterward
 to keep your system secure.

If AirPlay still persists after all of this, something is reinstalling it
, which would indicate 
malware or unauthorized persistence mechanisms.

🚨 
Let me know once you've disabled SIP fully and removed AirPlayXPCHelper!

It looks like there was a syntax issue with your command. The correct way to run these commands is 
one at a time
.

🚨 Step 1: Boot Out AirPlayXPCHelper

Run this first:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

✅ This 
forces AirPlayXPCHelper to stop running.

🚨 Step 2: Block AirPlayXPCHelper from Running Again

Now, 
change its permissions
 so it 
cannot restart
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

✅ This 
prevents macOS from launching AirPlayXPCHelper in the future.

🚨 Step 3: Restart Your Mac

After running these two commands, 
restart your Mac
 and check if AirPlay is finally disabled.

Once you reboot, confirm it’s gone by running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is permanently disabled.

🚨 
If it still appears, something is reinstalling it, and we will investigate further.

Let Me Know the Results!

Run each command separately.

Restart your Mac.

Check if AirPlay is gone.

🚨 
Let me know if the purple AirPlay icon is finally gone!

Findings: AirPlayXPCHelper is Already Stopped

Since you got:

"Boot-out failed: 3: No such process"

This means 
AirPlayXPCHelper is no longer running
, which is good! ✅

Now, let’s confirm it’s really gone.

🚨 Step 1: Verify AirPlay is No Longer Running

Run this in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is fully disabled.

🚨 
If 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 still appears, something restarted it.

🚨 Step 2: Check If AirPlayUIAgent is Running

Since AirPlayXPCHelper is gone, let’s check if the 
UI process
 is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl list | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is completely disabled.

🚨 
If something appears, the UI process is still running and needs to be removed.

Let Me Know the Results!

Run 
ps aux | grep -i airplay

 and tell me if anything appears.

Run 
launchctl list | grep -i airplay

 and let me know the output.

🚨 
If AirPlay is fully gone, you’re good to go!
 If not, we’ll find what’s restarting it.
