em should now be writable.

🚨 Step 4: Disable Sealed System Volume (SSV)

Since macOS 
Big Sur and later use Signed System Volume (SSV)
, we need to disable it temporarily:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

✅ This allows full modifications of system files.

🚨 Step 5: Restart & Modify AirPlayXPCHelper

Restart your Mac normally.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

✅ This should now allow deletion of AirPlayXPCHelper.

🚨 Step 6: Re-Enable SSV & SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone:

Reboot into Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
 while restarting).

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

Final Check: Verify AirPlay is Gone

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ If nothing appears, 
AirPlay is permanently disabled.

Let Me Know the Results!

Try remounting 
/
 in Recovery Mode.

Try disabling 
authenticated-root
.

Restart and see if AirPlay can be removed.

🚨 If the system 
still won’t let you mount as writable
, let me know!

Findings: Root File System is Still Read-Only, Even with SIP Disabled

🚨 
You're still getting "Read-only file system" errors
 when trying to modify or delete 
AirPlayXPCHelper
.

🔹 This means 
macOS’s Sealed System Volume (SSV) is still protecting system files.

Even though 
SIP is disabled
, 
SSV prevents any modifications to 
/usr/libexec/
.

To remove 
AirPlayXPCHelper
, we 
must disable SSV, mount the root as writable, then remove the file.

🚨 Step-by-Step: Fully Unlock & Remove AirPlayXPCHelper

Since macOS 
Big Sur and later
 introduced 
SSV
, we must first 
disable it in Recovery Mode.

1️⃣ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (⌘) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen.

2️⃣ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar.

Select 
Terminal
.

3️⃣ Disable SSV (Sealed System Volume)

Since macOS won’t let us edit system files, we need to 
disable SSV and remount the disk as writable.

Run these commands 
in Recovery Mode
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

✅ 
This disables SSV, allowing system modifications.

4️⃣ Remount Root as Writable

Now, remount the system partition so we can make changes:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

✅ 
If successful, your root filesystem is now writable.

5️⃣ Delete AirPlayXPCHelper

Now that the filesystem is writable, try again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

✅ 
If successful, AirPlayXPCHelper will be permanently removed.

6️⃣ Reboot & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac normally.

Run this command to check if AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally removed.

7️⃣ Re-Enable SSV & SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone:

Reboot into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 on restart).

Run these commands to restore normal system security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

🚨 Let Me Know the Results!

Try disabling 
authenticated-root
 in Recovery Mode.

Try remounting 
/
 as writable.

Remove 
AirPlayXPCHelper
.

Restart and check if it's gone.

🚨 If you 
still
 get "Read-only file system," let me know!
