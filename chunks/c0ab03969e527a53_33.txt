w" message, this could indicate:

A RAM issue
 – Your Mac may be running out of available memory due to a memory leak or excessive system processes.

A swap/memory paging issue
 – macOS may be struggling to allocate virtual memory properly.

A disk issue
 – If the system is using disk-based swap memory and there’s little free space, it could cause errors.

This might 
explain why mounting the root filesystem as writable failed.

If macOS 
lacks enough memory
, it may be preventing system modifications.

🚨 Next Steps: Check Memory & Disk Usage

Before trying to modify system files again, let’s check if memory is being used up.

1️⃣ Check Current RAM & Swap Usage

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

vm_stat
sysctl hw.memsize

✅ This will show 
how much memory is being used and available.

2️⃣ Check Disk Space (Swap Might Be Full)

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

df

 -h

✅ 
If your main disk (
/
) is nearly full, macOS may be unable to create swap memory.

3️⃣ Try Freeing Up Memory

If memory is critically low, try:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo purge

✅ This forces macOS to 
clear inactive memory.

4️⃣ Restart into Safe Mode & Try Again

If the issue persists:

Restart your Mac and enter Safe Mode
 by holding 
Shift
 while booting.

Open 
Terminal
 and try:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

✅ Safe Mode runs with minimal system processes, which 
may allow modifications.

5️⃣ If All Else Fails: Run First Aid in Recovery Mode

If memory issues persist:

Reboot into Recovery Mode (
Command + R
)

Open 
Disk Utility

Select 
Macintosh HD

Click 
First Aid
 to check for errors

🚨 Let Me Know the Results!

Run 
vm_stat
, 
sysctl hw.memsize
, and 
df -h
 to check RAM & disk usage.

Try 
sudo purge
 to clear memory.

Restart into Safe Mode and check if mounting works.

Run First Aid if needed.

🚨 
If the memory issue continues, this could indicate a deeper hardware or malware persistence issue.
 Let me know what you find!
