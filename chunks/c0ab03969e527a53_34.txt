Findings: Memory Is Not Critically Low, But Root File System Is Still Read-Only

✅ 
Your Mac has 16GB of RAM (
hw.memsize: 17179869184
), and memory usage looks normal.

🚨 
However, the root filesystem is still read-only, preventing AirPlayXPCHelper from being modified or removed.

🔹 This confirms that 
SSV (Sealed System Volume) is still enforced, blocking system file changes.

🚨 Next Step: Ensure SSV Is Disabled & Root is Writable

Even if 
SIP is disabled
, 
SSV must also be disabled and the root volume remounted as writable.

1️⃣ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Turn it back on and immediately hold 
Command (⌘) + R

 until you see the 
macOS Utilities screen.

2️⃣ Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Click 
Utilities
 in the top menu bar.

Select 
Terminal
.

3️⃣ Ensure SSV (Sealed System Volume) is Disabled

Run the following command:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

✅ This ensures that 
macOS does not enforce the read-only system volume.

4️⃣ Remount Root as Writable

After disabling SSV, 
remount the system volume as writable:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

✅ 
If this works, your system is now writable.

🚨 
If it fails again with "Permission Denied," macOS is still enforcing SSV.

5️⃣ Restart & Modify AirPlayXPCHelper

Once the system is writable, restart your Mac normally.

Then, try these commands again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

✅ 
If successful, AirPlayXPCHelper will be permanently removed.

6️⃣ Reboot & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac normally.

Run this command to check if AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is finally removed.

7️⃣ Re-Enable SSV & SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is confirmed gone:

Reboot into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 on restart).

Run these commands to restore normal system security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

🚨 Let Me Know the Results!

Try disabling 
authenticated-root
 in Recovery Mode.

Try remounting 
/
 as writable.

Remove 
AirPlayXPCHelper
.

Restart and check if it's gone.

🚨 
If you still get "Read-only file system," let me know!

Findings: 
sudo
 Command Not Found in Recovery Mode

🚨 
In macOS Recovery Mode, the 
sudo
 command is sometimes unavailable.

🔹 This is because 
Recovery Mode runs a minimal shell environment
 with limited commands.

Solution:
 You don’t need 
sudo
 in Recovery Mode because the Terminal already has root privileges.

🚨 Next Steps: Run Commands Without 
sudo

If you see 
"command not found" for 
sudo

, just 
remove 
sudo

 and run the commands normall
