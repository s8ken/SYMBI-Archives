t Root as Writable

Since the root file system is still 
read-only
, we must 
remount it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

✅ 
If this works, your system is now writable.

🚨 
If you still get "Read-only file system," let me know!

3️⃣ Delete 
AirPlayXPCHelper

Now that the system is writable, delete AirPlayXPCHelper:

sh

Copy

Edit

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

✅ 
This permanently removes AirPlayXPCHelper.

4️⃣ Restart & Verify AirPlay is Gone

Restart your Mac normally.

Run this command to check if AirPlay is still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is fully removed.

5️⃣ Re-Enable Security Protections (Final Step)

Once you confirm AirPlay is gone:

Restart into Recovery Mode again (
Command + R
 while rebooting).

Run these commands to restore SIP & SSV:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

csrutil 

enable

Restart back into macOS.

🚨 Let Me Know the Results!

Try deleting 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 in Recovery Mode.

Check if it's gone after reboot (

Re-enable SIP & SSV once confirmed.
