It looks like the last command didn't execute properly due to an 
incomplete command entry
. Let's go step by step.

🚨 Step 1: Re-run the Full Command Properly

Since your Terminal got stuck in 
pipe dquote>
, 
press 
Ctrl + C
 to cancel
 and then re-run this:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

✅ 
This will check again if any hidden AirPlay-related processes are running.

🛠️ Step 2: Manually Remove AirPlay UI Agent

If the purple icon is still showing, try this 
one at a time
:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent

✅ 
This force-closes the AirPlay UI process.

If the icon persists, clear cached preferences:

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults delete com.apple.airplay
killall SystemUIServer

✅ 
This resets AirPlay preferences and refreshes the menu bar.

🔄 Step 3: Restart & Check If the Icon is Gone

Restart your Mac.

Once back in macOS, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

✅ 
If nothing appears and the icon is gone, AirPlay is fully removed.

🚨 If the Icon is Still There:

Let me know if:

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent
 worked or not.

defaults delete com.apple.airplay && killall SystemUIServer
 made any changes.

If the icon disappears after a restart or still remains.

🚀 
We’ll keep digging if needed! Let me know what happens.

🚨 Fixing the 
pipe dquote>
 Error in zsh

The 

pipe dquote>

 message means that your previous command 
was not closed properly
, and zsh is waiting for more input.

To fix this:

Press 
Ctrl + C

 to cancel the incomplete command.

Re-run the correct command properly.

🚀 Step 1: Run the Command Again Correctly

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

✅ 
This checks if any AirPlay-related processes are running.

🛠️ Step 2: Remove the AirPlay UI Process

If the purple icon is still showing, run this:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent

✅ 
This force-closes the AirPlay UI process.

🗑️ Step 3: Clear Any Cached System Preferences

sh

Copy

Edit

defaults delete com.apple.airplay
killall SystemUIServer

✅ 
This removes stored AirPlay settings and refreshes the menu bar.

🔄 Step 4: Restart & Confirm

Restart your Mac.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

✅ 
If nothing appears, AirPlay is fully gone.

🚨 Let Me Know What Happens!

Did 
killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent
 work?

Did 
defaults delete com.apple.airplay
 remove the icon?

After a restart, is the purple icon still there?

🚀 
If the icon is still there, we will investigate deeper. Let me know!
