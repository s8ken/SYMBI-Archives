Check if there are any logs about AirPlay starting a session or connecting to a device.

Let me know what you find!

ChatGPT said:

Your Mac is saying that your user 
"lcl" is not in the sudoers file
, which means you don’t have administrative privileges to run 
sudo
 commands. This could be a 
security restriction
 or a sign that your account doesn't have admin rights.

Step 6: Check If Your Account Has Admin Rights

Let's confirm whether your account is an 
Administrator
:

Go to:

System Settings > Users & Groups

Check your user account ("lcl")

If it 
says "Admin"
, you should have admin rights.

If it 
only says "Standard"
, that means your account doesn’t have admin access.

If Your Account is Not Admin

This could explain 
why AirPlay processes are running without your control
—another account (possibly unauthorized) may have higher privileges.

Let me know if your account is 
Admin or Standard
, and we can decide the next steps!

You said:

its no standard but I can change it back to admin  

ChatGPT said:

That’s a 
huge red flag
—your account should not have been downgraded to 
Standard
 unless:

Someone (or something) changed it manually.

Another admin account exists and has control over system settings.

A security issue (malware, remote access, or persistence) is at play.

🚨 Immediate Next Steps: Regain Admin Control

Since you 
can change it back to Admin
, do that 
right now
:

Go to:

System Settings > Users & Groups

Click on your user ("lcl")

Toggle "Allow this user to administer this computer" (or similar wording)

Confirm the change and restart your Mac.

Next: Check for Other Admin Accounts

Once you regain admin control, let’s 
see if another admin account exists
:

Run This in Terminal (Now That You'll Be Admin Again)

sh

Copy

Edit

dscl . -list /Users | 

while

read

 user; 

do

 dscl . -

read

 /Users/

$user

 UserShell | grep -q 

"/bin/bash\|/bin/zsh"

 && 

echo

$user

; 

done

This will list 
all real user accounts on your Mac
, filtering out system accounts.

🚨 
If you see an unknown admin account
, that means someone/something else has system control.

Let me know once:

You’ve 
changed yourself back to admin.

You’ve 
checked for any other admin accounts.

This is a 
critical security moment
—we might be looking at an unauthorized system takeover.

You said:

its fine remember I said I was going to do it 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Now that you've restored 
Admin privileges
, let's proceed with our security checks carefully.

Step 7: Check for Other Admin Accounts

Since your account was 
downgraded
, we need to confirm whether there are 
other admin accounts on the system
 (authorized or unauthorized).

Now that you're 
Admin again
, run this command in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

What This Will Do:

It will list 
all accounts that currently have admin rights
 on your Mac.

If 
you see an unknown account
 (other than yourself), 
let me know immediately.

Next Steps After Checking Admins

If the only admin account is 
yours
 ✅ → We move forward with AirPlay investigation.

If 
there’s another unexpected admin account
 🚨 → We need to secure the system.

Run the command and let me know what it returns!

ok I am back

ChatGPT said:

Welcome back! Let's pick up where we left off.

Step 7: Check for Other Admin Accounts

Now that you're 
Admin again
, let’s confirm if any other accounts have admin access.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

What This Will Do:

It will list 
all accounts that currently have admin privileges
 on your Mac.

If 
you see an unknown account
, let me know immediately.

Once you run the command, share the output so we
