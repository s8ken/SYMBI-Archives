🚨 New Findings: macOS Still Thinks AirPlay is Supported

✅ 
No active AirPlay processes

✅ 
No AirPlay services running

✅ 
But system logs still show AirPlay errors

🚨 
Your Mac is detecting the TV as an "AV Receiver," which might be triggering the icon.

AirPlay logs show connection errors (
kConnectionErr -6753
).

This means macOS is 
trying and failing to communicate with an AirPlay service
—even though we removed it.

AirPlayReceiverKit
 is still "advertising access."

This suggests some AirPlay-related feature is still 
enabled on a UI level
 (even though the backend is gone).

🚀 Next Steps to Finally Remove the Icon

We now

:

Stopping macOS from treating your TV as an AirPlay receiver.

Forcing macOS to forget AirPlay preferences permanently.

🖥️ Step 1: Disconnect the TV & Restart

Physically unplug the HDMI cable from the Mac
 (or turn off the TV).

Restart your Mac
 and check if the icon disappears.
