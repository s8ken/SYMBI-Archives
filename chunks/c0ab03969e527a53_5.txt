I am admin now

Great! Now that you have 
admin access
, let’s continue our security check.

Step 7: Verify Admin Accounts

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to list all admin accounts:

sh

Copy

dscl . -

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

Why This Matters

If only 
your account
 is listed → ✅ No other admin users exist.

If you 
see an unknown account
 → 🚨 Possible unauthorized access.

After running it, let me know the output so we can determine if there’s anything suspicious.

Got it! Let's refocus on 
AirPlay and the TV/AV system
 issue.

Recap of What We Know

Your TV is connected as an external display
, but the 
purple indicator appeared
, which usually means 
AirPlay or Screen Recording is active
.

The Screen Mirroring icon was purple
, meaning macOS 
recognized the TV as an AirPlay-like display
 instead of a direct HDMI connection.

AirPlay-related processes were running
, even though you didn’t manually enable it.

Your account was downgraded from admin
, which is unusual but now fixed.

Step 8: Check AirPlay Display Mode

Now that you’re an admin again, let’s check 
exactly how macOS is treating the TV
.

1. Check System Settings

Go to:

System Settings > Displays

Look for an "AirPlay Display" setting.

If it 
says "Off"
, AirPlay should not be active.

If it 
lists your TV
, macOS is using 
AirPlay Extended Display Mode
 instead of a standard HDMI connection.

Let me know what it says!

You said:

it doesn't say airplay display at all but we found airplayy processes running and the airplay icon is purple in the task bar

ChatGPT said:

Got it—since 
AirPlay Display is missing from System Settings
, but 
AirPlay processes are running and the icon is purple
, that means macOS is 
treating your TV as an AirPlay target in the background
, even though it's not showing up in the UI.

This isn't normal behavior for a 
wired HDMI connection
, so we need to 
dig deeper
.

Step 9: Check Active AirPlay Services

Since AirPlay processes are running, let’s find out 
what triggered them
.

Run This Command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --info --last 10m

✅ 
If it works
 → Look for entries mentioning:

AirPlay session started

Connected to [TV Name]

Mirroring active

AirPlay receiver running

🚨 
If you get "Operation not permitted" again
, we need to 
enable Full Disk Access
 for Terminal first:

Go to:

System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access

Find "Terminal" in the list and enable it

Restart Terminal and try the command again

Why This Matters

If the logs show an 
active AirPlay session
, something is 
forcing
 AirPlay to run instead of standard HDMI.

If the logs 
don’t show AirPlay activity
, the process could be stuck in the background without an active connection.

Let me know what the logs say!

Findings from the AirPlay Logs

From your 
AirPlay logs
, we can confirm that:

AirPlay is actively running in the background
, despite the fact that your TV is not explicitly listed as an AirPlay display in System Settings.

AirPlayXPCHelper is managing endpoints and advertising services
, meaning macOS is treating your system as an 
AirPlay receiver and sender
.

Bonjour and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) AirPlay discovery are enabled
, suggesting that your Mac is searching for or being discovered by AirPlay-capable devices, even if you didn’t initiate it.

Endpoints and clusters are being created
, which could mean that 
macOS is establishing an AirPlay session without showing it in the UI
.

🚨 What This Means

Your Mac 
seems to be auto-enabling AirPlay features
, even though you connected the TV 
via HDMI
.

The system is 
advertising itself for AirPlay connections
, which it shouldn’t be doing unless you manually enabled AirPlay Receiver or mirroring.
