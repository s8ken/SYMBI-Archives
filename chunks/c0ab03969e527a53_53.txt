srutil 

enable

reboot

Then, check if AirPlay is still running:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

4️⃣ Alternative: Block the AirPlay Services via Firewall

If settings 
won’t apply
, try preventing 
network traffic for AirPlay
 instead:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

Then restart the firewall:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo pkill -HUP socketfilterfw

🚀 Next Steps

If 
defaults write
 now works → Restart & confirm AirPlay is gone
.

If AirPlay still runs → Move or delete the binaries manually in Recovery Mode
 (like we did before).

Let me know what happens after these steps! 🚨

Great! The command executed without errors this time. Now, let's 
verify that the setting has been applied
 and ensure that 
AirPlay is fully disabled
.

1️⃣ Verify AirPlay Settings

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay

Expected output: It should show 
receiver-enabled = 0
 or 
false
.

If you get 
"Domain com.apple.airplay does not exist"
, let me know.

2️⃣ Kill Any Running AirPlay Processes

Even though we changed the setting, 
AirPlay processes might still be running
. Let’s kill them:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent
sudo killall -9 AirPlayXPCHelper

If it says 
"No matching processes found"
, that’s a 
good sign
—it means AirPlay isn’t running.

Now, check if they are gone:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If you 
still see AirPlay processes
, we will take further action.

3️⃣ Restart SystemUIServer

Sometimes, changes don’t apply until 
SystemUIServer
 is restarted. Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

4️⃣ Restart Your Mac & Confirm

Reboot your Mac.

After restarting
, check for any AirPlay processes:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

If nothing shows up, 
AirPlay is fully disabled
.

Let me know what happens after these steps! 🚀

✅ 
Success!
 The setting has been correctly applied. 
AirPlay is now disabled at the system level.

🔍 Next Steps: Verify That AirPlay is Fully Shut Down

Now, let’s confirm that no AirPlay-related processes are still running.

1️⃣ 
Check for Running AirPlay Processes

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If 
no output
 appears (except for the 
grep
 process itself), 
AirPlay is completely disabled
.

If you 
still see processes running
, we will forcefully stop them.

2️⃣ 
Force Kill AirPlay Processes (If Needed)

If you still see AirPlay processes, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -9 AirPlayUIAgent
sudo killall -9 AirPlayXPCHelper

Then, recheck:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

3️⃣ 
Restart SystemUIServer to Ensure Changes Take Effect

bash

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

4️⃣ 
Reboot Your Mac & Final Confirmation

Restart your Mac.

After reboot, check again with:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i airplay

If no output appears, 
AirPlay is fully disabled and will not restart on boot.

🎯 Final Check: Does the Purple AirPlay Icon Still Appear?

If 
the icon is gone
, 
AirPlay is fully disabled.

If 
it still appears
, let me know.

Let me know how it looks after reboot! 🚀
