it

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If they are still running, proceed to 
Step 2
.

2️⃣ Lock AirPlay Launch Files to Block Auto-Restart

If 
launchctl
 does not prevent them from coming back, we will 
disable their launch files
.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper.plist
sudo 

touch

 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist

Then 
restart SystemUIServer
:

bash

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

Now, recheck:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

3️⃣ Restart Your Mac & Verify

Restart your Mac.

After reboot, check again:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If no processes appear, 
AirPlay is finally disabled.

4️⃣ Final Confirmation: Check If the Purple Icon Still Appears

If the 
AirPlay icon is gone
, then 
AirPlay is successfully disabled.

If 
it still appears
, let me know.

Let me know what happens after these steps! 🚀

🚨 SIP (System Integrity Protection) is Blocking Changes

macOS 
SIP (System Integrity Protection)
 is 
preventing you from fully disabling AirPlay services.
 This means AirPlay processes 
will keep restarting
 unless we temporarily 
disable SIP
 to make the necessary changes.

🛠️ Next Steps: Temporarily Disable SIP, Block AirPlay, Re-enable SIP

We need to 
disable SIP
, block AirPlay, and then 
re-enable SIP
 for security.

1️⃣ Disable SIP (Temporarily)

Restart your Mac in Recovery Mode
:

Power off your Mac.

Hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 and press the power button to turn it on.

Keep holding 
Command (⌘) + R
 until you see the Apple logo.

Open Terminal in Recovery Mode
:

In the menu bar, click 
Utilities > Terminal
.

Disable SIP
 by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

reboot

This will 
disable SIP and restart your Mac
.

2️⃣ Permanently Block AirPlay Services

Now that SIP is disabled, run the following commands:

bash

Copy

Edit

# Disable AirPlay services

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo launchctl 

disable

 gui/$(

id

 -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent
sudo launchctl bootout gui/$(

id

 -u)/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent

# Prevent AirPlay from being re-enabled

sudo 

touch

 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper.plist
sudo 

touch

 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent.plist

# Kill SystemUIServer to remove the icon

killall SystemUIServer

Now check if AirPlay is still running:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If 
AirPlay processes are gone
, proceed to 
Step 3
.

3️⃣ Re-enable SIP for Security

Once AirPlay is blocked, 
re-enable SIP to protect your system
.

Restart your Mac in Recovery Mode again
 (hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 at startup).

Open 
Terminal
 in Recovery Mode.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

reboot

This 
reenables SIP
 while keeping AirPlay 
disabled
.

4️⃣ Final Verification

After reboot, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If 
AirPlay is gone and the
