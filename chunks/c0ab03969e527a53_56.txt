I hear your frustration—we've been through multiple attempts, and AirPlay is 
still persisting
 despite SIP toggling, launchctl commands, and file permission changes.

Let's 
reassess the persistence
 by looking for 
hidden processes, deep system calls, or re-enabling mechanisms.

🔎 Next Steps: Advanced Investigation

1️⃣ Check if any process is automatically restarting AirPlay

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -i airplay
sudo launchctl 

print

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo launchctl 

print

 gui/$(

can you search is there a program or something on GitHub we can put over the top of all this to block it instead of disabling and removing things? Sure some enterprises disable airplay for privacy or commercial reasons in a business setting

I understand your frustration with the persistent 
AirPlay services
 on your Mac. 
Given the challenges we've encountered in disabling these services through traditional methods, exploring enterprise-level solutions may offer a more robust approach.

Enterprise Solutions to Disable AirPlay:

Configuration Profiles via MDM (Mobile Device Management):

Organizations often use MDM solutions to enforce device configurations, including disabling AirPlay. By deploying a configuration profile, you can set the 
allowAirPlay
 key to 
false
, effectively preventing AirPlay functionality.

Jamf Pro Example:

Administrators have utilized Jamf Pro to disable AirPlay Receiver by creating a custom configuration profile.

This involves using a JSON schema with the domain 
com.apple.controlcenter
 and setting the appropriate keys to disable AirPlay.

Apple Business Essentials:

Apple provides guidance on configuring AirPlay settings using Apple Business Essentials, allowing administrators to disable AirPlay on managed devices.

Custom Scripts:

There are scripts available that can disable AirPlay by modifying system permissions or settings. However, these often require disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP), which may not be advisable in a production environment. For instance, a GitHub Gist provides a script to disable AirPlay by changing permissions on the 
AirPlayUIAgent
 executable. 

Considerations:

System Integrity Protection (SIP):

Many methods to disable AirPlay involve altering system files, which SIP protects.

Temporarily disabling SIP can allow these changes but may expose the system to security risks.

Re-enabling SIP after making the changes is crucial.

MDM Deployment:

Utilizing an MDM solution provides centralized control and is the recommended approach for managing multiple devices in an organization.

This method ensures compliance with organizational policies without compromising system security.

Recommendation:

For a secure and scalable solution, implementing an MDM strategy to deploy configuration profiles that disable AirPlay is advisable.

This approach aligns with enterprise best practices and maintains system integrity.

If you're managing a personal device, carefully consider the implications of disabling SIP before making system-level changes.
