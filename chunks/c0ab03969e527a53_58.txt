Conclusion:

The script by chrisgeo offers a method to disable AirPlay by altering system file permissions.

However, due to SIP, you'll need to temporarily disable this protection to execute the script effectively.

Alternatively, if you're using a newer macOS version, you might disable AirPlay directly through system settings without modifying system files.

If you decide to proceed with the script, ensure you understand the implications of disabling SIP and follow the steps carefully to maintain your system's security.

I understand your frustration with the persistent 
AirPlay services
 on your Mac and the repeated need to disable 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 during our attempts to resolve this issue. 
While I don't have the capability to track the exact number of times we've disabled SIP during our troubleshooting sessions, it's clear that this process has been repeated multiple times without achieving the desired outcome.

Alternative Solutions to Consider:

Enterprise-Level Management:

Mobile Device Management (MDM):

Utilizing MDM solutions allows for centralized control over device settings, including the ability to disable AirPlay. This approach is commonly used in organizational environments to enforce specific configurations.

Network-Level Restrictions:

Firewall Rules:

Implementing firewall rules to block AirPlay ports can prevent devices from using AirPlay services. This method doesn't require modifications to individual devices and can be managed at the network level.

Third-Party Tools:

Custom Scripts:

Some community-developed scripts aim to disable AirPlay by altering system settings. However, these often require disabling SIP and may not be reliable across different macOS versions.

Recommendation:

Given the challenges faced with disabling AirPlay through standard methods and the repeated need to disable SIP, it may be beneficial to consult with an IT professional or consider using an MDM solution if this is within an organizational context. 
These approaches can provide more robust and manageable solutions to control AirPlay functionality without compromising system integrity.
