le icon confirms an AirPlay session is active
, even if the UI doesn’t display it properly.

This could be due to:

A bug or persistence issue
 keeping AirPlay enabled even when not needed.

Another device (attacker or rogue system) trying to force an AirPlay session.

Some accessibility or automation settings forcing AirPlay into an active state.

🔧 Next Steps: Stop and Disable AirPlay

Step 1: Manually Turn Off AirPlay Receiver

Even though it doesn’t show up in 
System Settings > Displays
, 
there is another place where AirPlay Receiver settings exist
.

Go to:

System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff

Look for "AirPlay Receiver"

If it’s ON → 
Turn it OFF

If it’s already OFF → That means AirPlay is being forced by another process.

Let me know what you find there.

Step 2: Kill AirPlay Processes

Since 
AirPlayXPCHelper is actively running
, we can try stopping it manually.

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to stop AirPlay-related processes:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo pkill -9 AirPlayXPCHelper

If 
sudo
 doesn’t work, try:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall -9 AirPlayXPCHelper

After running it, check if:

The 
purple AirPlay icon disappears
 from the menu bar.

Your 
TV stays connected as a regular display without AirPlay interference
.

Step 3: Prevent AirPlay From Restarting

To 
stop AirPlay from auto-running
, disable its system service.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper

Then restart your Mac to see if AirPlay stops being forced.

What to Look Out For

If 
AirPlay reactivates after killing the process
, we might be dealing with 
a deeper persistence mechanism
.

If 
AirPlay Receiver was already OFF
, that means something else is triggering AirPlay sessions 
outside of user control
.

If you 
see another device trying to connect via AirPlay
, that could indicate unauthorized network activity.

Let me know what happens after 
turning off AirPlay Receiver and killing the process
! 🚨

its all off 

ChatGPT said:

Good! Since 
AirPlay Receiver is off and the processes are no longer running
, that means we’ve successfully stopped it for now.

Final Check: Confirm AirPlay Stays Disabled

To make sure AirPlay doesn’t automatically restart:

1. Restart Your Mac

After restarting, 
check if the purple indicator appears again.

If 
AirPlay stays off
, we’ve solved the issue.

If it 
comes back
, something is forcing it to restart.

2. Check if AirPlay Processes Are Still Gone

After rebooting, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

If 
AirPlayXPCHelper is gone
, that’s a ✅ good sign. If it’s back, we need to investigate persistence.

What This Tells Us

If 
AirPlay stays off
, it was likely a system bug keeping it active.

If 
AirPlay turns back on
, something (malware, automation, or another system process) is forcing it to restart.

After rebooting, let me know 
if AirPlay stays disabled or if it comes back!
