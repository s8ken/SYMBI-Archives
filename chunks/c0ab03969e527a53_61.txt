is this using his script?

ChatGPT said:

I understand your desire to disable AirPlay on your Mac using 
Chrisgeo's script
. 
This script modifies the permissions of the 
AirPlayUIAgent
 executable to enable or disable AirPlay functionality.

The previous steps I provided involve directly renaming or removing the 
AirPlayUIAgent
 application, which is a more direct method to achieve the same goal.

Comparison:

Chrisgeo's Script:

Adjusts the file permissions of 
AirPlayUIAgent
 to disable or enable AirPlay.

Previous Method:

Renames or removes the 
AirPlayUIAgent
 application to disable AirPlay.

Recommendation:

Both methods require modifying system files and temporarily disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP) and the authenticated root.

The choice between using the script or manually renaming/removing the application depends on your comfort level with scripting versus manual file management.

If you prefer to use Chrisgeo's script, ensure you follow the steps to disable SIP and mount the system volume as writable before executing the script. 
After running the script to disable AirPlay, remember to re-enable SIP to maintain your system's security.

If you need further assistance with either method, feel free to ask!
