Based on your current 
diskutil list
 output, the system volume you need to mount as writable is identified as:

bash

/dev/disk3s3

When you follow the steps provided earlier to disable AirPlay (using Chrisgeo's script), ensure you use this exact identifier (`disk

The error you're getting (
zsh: permission denied: /dev/disk3s3
) happens because you're directly trying to execute or access a disk device instead of using it in the proper command.

Here's how you correctly make the system volume writable step-by-step:

1. Restart into Recovery Mode

Apple Silicon (M1/M2)
: Shut down, then press and hold the power button until "Loading startup options" appears. Select 
Options
, then 
Continue
.

2. In Recovery, open Terminal:

From the top menu bar: 
Utilities → Terminal
.

3. Disable SIP and allow modifications of the system volume

In Terminal, run:

shell

Copy

Edit

csrutil disable
csrutil authenticated-root disable

4. Restart back into macOS normally:

Type:

shell

Copy

Edit

reboot

5. Remount the system volume as writable (once booted normally):

Open Terminal and run:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /
sudo killall Finder

At this stage, the system volume 
/
 is writable, and you can apply Chrisgeo’s script or manual changes to disable AirPlay components.

Why the earlier permission issue occurred:

You cannot directly execute or access disk partitions (
/dev/disk3s3
) as regular files or commands.

You must mount the 
system volume
 (
/
) as writable using the correct syntax shown above.

Follow these exact instructions to achieve a writable system volume safely. Let me know if you need further help.

Here’s exactly how to do it clearly, step-by-step:

✅ Step-by-Step to Make System Writable on macOS:

Step 1: Boot into Recovery Mode

Shut down your Mac completely.

Press and hold the 
Power Button
 (on M1/M2 MacBooks) until you see 
"Loading startup options"
.

Select 
Options
, then click 
Continue
 to boot into 
Recovery Mode
.

Step 2: Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

Once Recovery loads:

From the top menu, select:

Utilities
 → 
Terminal

Step 3: Disable SIP and Enable Writable System Volume

In Terminal, enter these commands one by one:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Both commands must say they've successfully completed.

Step 4: Restart Normally

Still in Terminal, type:

bash

Copy

Edit

reboot

Your Mac will restart normally.

Now, once your Mac boots normally:

Step 5: Mount the System Volume as Writable

Open a normal Terminal window, and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /
sudo killall Finder

After this command, your system volume (
/
) is writable, and you can proceed to run the AirPlay disable script from Chrisgeo or apply manual changes as intended.

⚠️ Important Notes:

After you've finished your modifications, you'll later re-enable SIP to protect your system again by booting back into Recovery and running:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

You don't need to immediately reboot again after booting normally; you can do your tas
