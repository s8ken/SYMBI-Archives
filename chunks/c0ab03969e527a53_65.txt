Confirm once you reach this stage, or if you have any questions.

This error occurs because the snapshot is still active, preventing you from mounting the volume as writable.

Let's fix it clearly, step by step:

✅ Correct Steps to Fix the "Permission Denied (66)" error:

Step 1: Boot into Recovery Mode again

Shut down
 your Mac.

Press and hold 
Power
 until you see 
"Loading startup options"
.

Select 
Options
, then 
Continue
.

Step 2: Open Terminal in Recovery

Click 
Utilities → Terminal
 from the top menu.

Step 3: Properly Mount the System Volume as Writable in Recovery

Run this command exactly:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

If the command above gives you an error like 
mount_apfs: volume could not be mounted: Permission denied
, run the following commands exactly to find and mount the correct volume:

1. 
Find your system volume
:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil apfs list

From the output, identify your macOS volume (likely labeled 
Macintosh HD
). It will look something like this:

mathematica

Copy

Edit

Volume

diskXsY

Mount

Point

:

/

Volume

Name

:

Macintosh

HD

For example, if it's 
disk3s3
, proceed:

2. 
Mount volume explicitly
 (replace 
disk3s3
 with the volume you identified):

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /dev/disk3s3

Now, your system volume should successfully mount as writable.

Step 4: Verify Writable Mount

Ensure no error appears. If no error, you're good.

You can now safely proceed to your original plan—deleting or modifying AirPlay files as per the script you planned to use.

Next Steps After Completing Your Changes:

Once you've done your task, remember to:

Make sure to re-enable SIP
 afterward by rebooting into Recovery and entering:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Reboot
 to your main system again normally.

✅ 
Confirm if this resolves your mount issue or if you encounter a different problem.

Touch ID
 (Power button) until you see "Loading startup options."

🔄 Step 2a: 
Reboot the Mac (Critical Step)

🔑 Step 3: 
Remount your macOS System Volume as Writable

When you're back in your regular user session (logged into your account), open Terminal and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /

Enter your password if asked.

If you get a permission error, try explicitly:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /dev/disk3s3

(Use your actual disk identifier from 
diskutil list
, e.g., 
disk3s3
.)

Now your volume should be writable.

🚧 Step 3a: 
(Optional but Recommended) Verify Writable Volume

Check by:

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 /System/testfile && 

ls

 /System

If no error appears, you’re successfully writable.
