would run the ChrisGeo script you've chosen to disable AirPlay fully. Copy/paste or run according to the script instructions.)

⚠️ 
After you’re done: Re-enable Security Protections!

Reboot into Recovery again
 (repeat step 1 above).

Enter:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

(This re-enables SIP and security features.)

Then reboot normally.

You can now proceed carefully through these steps.

Confirm clearly if you encounter any issues.

I think you are missing the point that current sip is already disabled and we got the error 66

You’re right
—let’s clarify carefully. Since 
SIP is already disabled
 and you still received the error:

vbnet

Copy

Edit

mount_apfs:

 volume could 

not

 be mounted: Permission denied

mount:

 / failed 

with

66

This happens because even with SIP off, your root volume isn't writable yet.

You need to explicitly run the following command to disable authenticated-root and make the system volume fully writable (which is separate from standard SIP disabling):

🔑 
Correct steps from your current state (SIP already off):

✅ 
Step 1: Reboot to Recovery again (just once)

Restart and enter 
Recovery Mode
:

Shut down your Mac completely.

Hold down the 
Power Button (Touch ID)
 until you see 
"Loading startup options"
.

Select 
Options → Continue
.

✅ 
Step 2: In Recovery Terminal, explicitly disable authenticated-root

Run exactly:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Confirm the message indicating it’s successfully disabled.

(Even though SIP itself is off, this step is specifically required to make macOS root volume writable.)

✅ 
Step 3: Reboot back into regular macOS

Restart normally.

✅ 
Step 4: Remount the macOS Volume as writable (this fixes the error 66):

Open Terminal in your normal session and run carefully:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /

If you still get an error here, explicitly mount your root volume with:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil list

Identify your root system volume (likely 
disk3s3
 from your earlier output) and run explicitly:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /dev/disk3s3

This step should now complete without error 66.

✅ 
After completing these steps
, your root volume will be writable, and you're prepared to fully implement the ChrisGeo script.

No additional restarts or extra Recovery sessions are needed until you’re ready to re-enable SIP after you finish running your script.

Let me know if you encounter any issues.

This error:

vbnet

Copy

Edit

mount_apfs:

 volume could 

not

 be mounted: Permission denied

mount:

 / failed 

with

66

indicates that 
authenticated-root
 protection is still enabled, or the volume wasn't remounted correctly.

Double-check the following steps:

Boot into Recovery Mode
 (restart and hold the power button, select 
Options
, continue).

In Recovery Terminal, explicitly run:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

While still in Recovery
, verify the status by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil status

This should clearly state:

lua

Copy

Edit

Authenticated Root 

status

: disabled

Then
, restart back into normal macOS.

After logging back into your normal session
, run again:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /

This exact procedure is required—doing the authenticated-root disable in Recovery is not enough if you skip verifying or if you restart incorrectly. The error you're currently seeing (
66 Permission denied
) occurs because macOS is still enforcing the sealed system volume.

Please confirm carefully in Recovery Terminal that:

Authenticated Root
 is explicitly listed as 
disabled
 after the 
csrutil authenticated-root disable
 command.

Do this carefully and let me know the result when you come back.
