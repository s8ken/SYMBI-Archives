overy boot to ensure the root filesystem is writable.

Run exactly this in Terminal and send back the output:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo mount -uw /
mount
csrutil status

This will confirm:

The root filesystem is now writable (
mount
).

SIP (System Integrity Protection) and authenticated-root settings (
csrutil status
).

Once you share this output, we'll proceed clearly from there.

Your root filesystem (
/
) is still mounted as 
sealed and read-only
, even though SIP is disabled. That's why you see the 
Permission denied (66)
 error.

To make the system volume writable, you 
must explicitly disable the authenticated root
 (a separate security feature beyond SIP):

Perform these steps exactly in Recovery Mode:

Reboot into 
Recovery Mode
 again:

Shut down the Mac.

Hold down the power button until "Loading startup options" appears.

Click 
Options
, then 
Continue
.

Open 
Terminal
 from the Recovery menu bar (Utilities → Terminal).

Execute the following command exactly:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

After the command completes successfully, reboot normally:

bash

Copy

Edit

reboot

After rebooting normally:

Open Terminal and run these commands to verify the status:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil status
mount | grep 

" / "

You should see:

Authenticated Root
: disabled

System Integrity Protection
: disabled

The root filesystem (
/
) should 
no longer be sealed and read-only
 after rebooting.

Return here once you've completed these steps and verified the status above.

if I got back into recover and into terminal and type csrutil authenticated-root disable it will say its already disabled

It means macOS is currently booted from a sealed snapshot rather than the writable root volume. This usually happens when the system is still booting from the protected snapshot of the operating system, even if you disabled SIP and Authenticated Root.

Here’s exactly what you should do next to resolve this:

Step-by-Step (one more recovery boot):

Restart your Mac again into Recovery Mode:

Shut down your Mac.

Press and hold the power button until you see “Loading startup options.”

Choose 
Options
, then click 
Continue
.

Open Terminal
 (from the top menu bar: 
Utilities → Terminal
).

Identify your macOS volume
:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil apfs list

Look carefully at the output. Identify your primary macOS volume named something like 
"Macintosh HD"
 (not "Data" or "Preboot"). Make a note of the exact 
identifier
, which is something like 
disk3s3
 (yours was previously 
disk3s3
).

Mount the volume as writable:

Use the exact disk identifier from above:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD

(Make sure to use your exact volume name above, typically 
"Macintosh HD"
.)

If it returns no error, it's successful.
