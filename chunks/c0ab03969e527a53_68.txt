ou get permission errors again, first explicitly mount the correct device:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /dev/disk3s3 /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD

(Replace 
disk3s3
 with your actual disk identifier from the previous step.)

Verify the mount succeeded
:

bash

Copy

Edit

mount | grep Macintosh

Ensure you see output showing it mounted as 
read/write
 (
rw
), not sealed or read-only.

Rebuild a writable snapshot of the volume
 (required for persistent changes):

bash

Copy

Edit

bless --folder /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot

(This step creates a new writable snapshot that macOS boots from.)

Reboot into normal mode:

bash

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting back normally:

Run these checks again in 
Terminal
 to confirm:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil status
mount | grep 

" / "

You should see:

Authenticated Root: disabled

System Integrity Protection: disabled

Volume mounted as 
read/write
 (no longer sealed)

Return here after confirming this step-by-step.

I filled the steps but it kept saying sealed 

ChatGPT said:

When you repeatedly see the "sealed" error despite following the exact steps, it typically means that macOS is still enforcing a cryptographic seal on the snapshot of the system volume.

The error you're seeing:

pgsql

Copy

Edit

mount_apfs: volume could 

not

 be mounted: Permission denied
mount: / failed 

with

66

/dev/disk3s3s1 

on

 / (apfs, sealed, 

local

, 

read

-

only

, journaled)

What this means clearly:

Your Mac is still booting from a sealed snapshot (a cryptographically signed read-only state). Even though you've disabled System Integrity Protection (
csrutil disable
) and Authenticated Root (
csrutil authenticated-root disable
), macOS is still enforcing the sealed snapshot.

To resolve the issue with the sealed snapshot and get the filesystem writable, please carefully follow these 
exact steps
. We'll do this slowly and clearly, step-by-step:

1. Boot into Recovery Mode again:

Restart your Mac.

Hold down the 
power button
 until you see "Loading startup options".

Select 
Options
, then 
Continue
.

Enter your admin credentials.

2. Open Terminal in Recovery:

From the recovery menu, select 
Utilities > Terminal
.

3. Double-check your SIP and Authenticated-root status first:

Run this command in Terminal:

lua

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

status

And then:

lua

Copy

Edit

csrutil authenticated-root 

status

If you see something like:

System Integrity Protection status: disabled.

Authenticated-root status: disabled.

Then proceed to step 4. If either one says "enabled," disable it with:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

then reboot back to Recovery mode again.

4. Mount your System Volume writable (remove the snapshot sealing):

Now, run these commands 
exactly as they appear
:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil list internal

Locate your 
Macintosh HD
 system volume. Typically it will be 
/dev/disk3s3
 or similar.

Then enter (replace disk identifier if different):

bash

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

If you get an error again, you must manually mount the main volume writable by specifying the volume explicitly:

bash

Copy

Edit

diskutil apfs unlockVolume disk3s3
diskutil mount disk3s3
mount -uw /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD

Replace 
disk3s3
 if needed based on the diskutil output.

If this succeeds without errors, your volume is now writable.

Important check
:

Confirm with:

nginx

Copy

Edit

mount

You should 
no longer see
 the word 
sealed
 in the output for your root (
/
) volume.

STOP HERE. DO NOT PROCEED BEYOND THIS POINT YET.

Please confirm if you're successfully at this point without errors. Let me know clearly the output or any errors, and then we'll continue safely.
