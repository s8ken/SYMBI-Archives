he complexity we've reached.

Your Original Goal:

You want to 
fully and permanently disable AirPlay
 on your macOS system to ensure:

No remote access through AirPlay.

No unauthorized screen mirroring or streaming.

No unwanted processes (
AirPlayXPCHelper
, 
AirPlayUIAgent
) running.

Why We've Been Struggling:

macOS treats 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 and 
AirPlayUIAgent
 as critical system services.

These services are protected by 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 and Apple's "sealed" APFS snapshot, meaning macOS intentionally prevents users from modifying or disabling them under normal conditions.

Each attempt to disable these processes temporarily has been undone upon reboot because macOS continuously enforces system integrity.

Repeatedly disabling SIP and trying to manually remove or restrict these components has created frustration without achieving lasting results.

What We Actually Need:

A solution that reliably stops AirPlay functionality without fighting the OS directly:

Ideal Outcome:

Prevent AirPlay from activating or being usable at the OS/network level.

Leave SIP and authenticated-root intact (ideally re-enabled later).

Avoid complex filesystem hacks, as macOS may revert these changes after updates.

Practical and Reliable Alternatives:

Instead of manually deleting or disabling system services, consider these more sustainable solutions:

1. Firewall-based blocking:

Use a firewall (built-in or third-party) to explicitly block AirPlay services (
AirPlayXPCHelper
 and 
AirPlayUIAgent
) from communicating over the network.

This ensures the services exist but remain completely isolated.

2. Configuration Profiles (Enterprise Approach):

macOS allows creating a Configuration Profile (
.mobileconfig
) that explicitly disables AirPlay, permanently enforcing this at the system level.

Such profiles are widely used by companies and educational institutions to block AirPlay for privacy and security.

3. Network-level blocking (Router):

Configure the network/router to block AirPlay-related traffic (usually via Bonjour/mDNS, which runs on UDP port 5353).

Very effective and low-risk.

Recommended Way Forward (Stable & Reliable):

I strongly recommend approach #2 (a 
Configuration Profile
), as it is designed precisely for what you're attempting:

✅ 
Configuration Profile approach (Easy and Reliable)
:

We can create a simple, signed configuration profile.

This explicitly instructs macOS: "AirPlay must remain off."

Once installed, macOS enforces the profile continuously without needing to disable SIP or alter system files.

Would you like me to guide you step-by-step through this more stable approach?

It achieves your ultimate goal—permanently and robustly blocking AirPlay—without continually fighting macOS system protections.

You said:

I simply do not want my screen being shared without my permission if say I am on a zoom call or any other meeting situation. 

ChatGPT said:

That's exactly the clarity we needed.

Your goal isn't specifically "remove AirPlay"—your goal is:

✅ 
"Prevent my Mac's screen from being shared or mirrored without explicit permission, especially during Zoom or other video calls."

This greatly simplifies the solution, because AirPlay itself isn't the root problem—the real issue is unwanted screen sharing or recording functionality. Let's 
refocus
 clearly on practical, effective solutions:

🔐 Practical Steps to Stop Unauthorized Screen Sharing or Mirroring on macOS

1. Disable Screen Sharing, Remote Management, and Remote Login:

Open

System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
Sharing
.

Ensure these settings are 
OFF
:

✅ 
Screen Sharing

✅ 
Remote Management

✅ 
Remote Login

(You've already confirmed Remote Login is off previously.)

2. Disable AirPlay Receiver via macOS Settings:

Go to 
System Settings
 → 
General
 → 
AirDrop & Handoff
 → 
AirPlay Receiver
.

Set 
AirPlay Receiver
 to 
OFF
.

(You have attempted terminal-based solutions before, but please confirm this via GUI again.)
