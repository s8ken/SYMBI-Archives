onnections.

Now, let me know what you’d like to check next. Do you want to:

See if the purple indicator is still appearing?

Check if AirPlay processes are still running in the background?

Look into why AirPlay was activating despite these settings being off?

I’ll wait for your direction.

I'm telling you the purple icon is there and we know processes are running!!

Understood! Since 
AirPlay is turned off in settings, but the purple icon is still there and processes are running
, something is forcing AirPlay to stay active despite your settings.

Next Step: Find Out What’s Forcing AirPlay to Stay On

Since we've already checked settings, let's now check 
system services and logs
 to see what is triggering AirPlay.

1. Check if AirPlay is Being Forced by a System Service

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to see if 
AirPlayXPCHelper
 or other AirPlay-related services are actively running:

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl list | grep -i airplay

🔹 
If you see "com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper" or similar, macOS is still running AirPlay despite being turned off in settings.

2. Check for Recent AirPlay System Logs

Now, let's check 
why AirPlay is running
 and 
what triggered it
 in the last 10 minutes:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --info --last 10m

🔹 
This will tell us if AirPlay is starting a session, connecting to a device, or being triggered by something else.

Run these two commands and let me know the results. Then, we’ll decide the next step based on the findings! 🚨

Findings: AirPlayUIAgent is Still Running

The command output shows that 

com.apple.AirPlayUIAgent
 is still active
, which means macOS is 
still running AirPlay UI components
, even though you've turned off AirPlay in settings.

Next Step: Check AirPlay Logs

Now, let's see 
why
 AirPlayUIAgent is still running.

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.airplay"'

 --info --last 10m

This will tell us:

✅ 
If an AirPlay session is active

✅ 
If a device is connecting (or trying to connect) to your Mac

✅ 
If macOS is forcing AirPlay for another reason

Run the command and let me know the results! 🚨
