t Firewall to Block AirPlay Completely:

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper

This ensures macOS firewall explicitly blocks network access to AirPlay.

4. Block mDNS (Bonjour/AirPlay Protocol) at Your Router:

Log in to your router.

Block the 
UDP port 5353
 (mDNS/Bonjour), which AirPlay relies upon.

If this port is blocked, AirPlay cannot advertise or discover devices, completely preventing remote connections via AirPlay from external devices.

5. Configure Zoom and Other Apps Specifically:

Zoom:

Open Zoom → 
Settings
 → 
Screen Sharing

Set to: 
Host Only
 or fully disable as needed.

Other video-conferencing apps:

Review their settings to explicitly forbid or require consent before screen sharing or recording.

🚨 
Key Security Check (Already Done by You):

You've verified multiple times:

shell

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E "AirPlay|screensharing|screencapture|VNC"

Keep periodically checking this to confirm these processes aren't unexpectedly active.

Your Next Step (Recommended):

I strongly suggest first implementing the Firewall-based solution (
Step 3
) right now. It's immediate, simple, effective, and doesn't require repeatedly disabling SIP or dealing with sealed APFS volumes.

Afterward, if you'd like, we can further reinforce security with a 
Configuration Profile
.

Do you want me to walk you slowly through executing Step 3 (Firewall Blocking)?

This will directly and immediately achieve the outcome you're really looking for.

These two AirPlay processes running are standard macOS system processes, not necessarily signs of unauthorized use:

AirPlayUIAgent
 (user interface agent)

AirPlayXPCHelper
 (background helper for AirPlay communications)

They will appear by default on recent macOS systems even if AirPlay is disabled. Their mere presence does 
not automatically indicate active or malicious screen sharing
.

✅ 
What this means for you right now:

These processes appearing in the list are expected. It doesn't imply your screen is currently being mirrored or recorded.

If you followed 
Step 3 (Firewall Blocking)
 from the previous instructions, these agents 
cannot communicate externally
, effectively neutralizing unauthorized AirPlay usage.

📌 
How to verify active AirPlay connections (Recommended sanity check):

Run this command to check for actual network-based AirPlay connections:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -iUDP:5353

If it returns nothing, 
no external devices are actively connected or communicating
 via AirPlay.

If you see any AirPlay-related processes actively communicating, then we know we still have a live issue.

🔐 
Recommended immediate action:

Could you run this quick command right now?

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -iUDP:5353

This simple step will conclusively determine if there's active AirPlay traffic on your network interface.
