 to ensure rules haven't changed.

This configuration is robust and meets your goal of confidently preventing unauthorized screen sharing during Zoom or other video meetings.

Almost there! It looks like both AirPlay components have been 
added
 to the firewall's application list, but your output doesn't show if they’re currently 
blocked
.

Let's quickly verify explicitly if they're blocked or not.

🔍 
Quick Check:

Please run these two commands separately:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getappblocked "/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app"

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getappblocked "/usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper"

✅ 
Expected Result:

You should see output similar to:

swift

Copy

Edit

/System/

Library

/CoreServices/

AirPlayUIAgent

.app 

is

 blocked

/usr/

libexec

/

AirPlayXPCHelper

is

 blocked

🔒 
If they’re NOT blocked (e.g., "is NOT blocked"):

Run the commands again explicitly:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp "/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app"
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp "/usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper"
killall SystemUIServer

Then, re-check the blocking status as shown above.

This step ensures these AirPlay-related components are explicitly and clearly 
blocked
 at the firewall level, preventing unauthorized outbound/inbound connections.

Great! 🎉

Now that both AirPlay components are explicitly 
blocked
 by your Mac’s firewall, here's what's happening:

✅ 
What you've achieved:

AirPlayUIAgent.app
 (the AirPlay user interface component) is fully blocked from any network communication.

AirPlayXPCHelper
 (the background service enabling AirPlay functionality) is also blocked.

This means even if AirPlay processes run, they cannot send or receive data through your firewall.

⚠️ 
Why the processes still show up:

macOS automatically restarts certain system processes (like AirPlay services) because they're considered integral OS components.

However, 
with the firewall blocking them
, these services become essentially non-functional from a networking perspective.

📌 
Next Steps (Recommended Verification):

Verify in Network Monitor:

Open 
Activity Monitor
, go to the 
Network tab
, and observe the processes.

Ensure AirPlay processes show minimal to no network activity.

Quick System Check via Terminal (double check):

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -iUDP | grep -i airplay

You should see no output, confirming no UDP connections exist for AirPlay.

🎯 
Your primary objective (preventing unauthorized screen sharing in meetings)
 is effectively addressed because:

AirPlay requires active network communication.

With firewall blocks in place, AirPlay can't transmit your screen.

🔐 
Optional (to strengthen security further):

Keep 
Stealth Mode
 enabled:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on

Occasionally verify firewall status:

shell

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --listapps | grep -i airplay

📍 
Final Recommendations:

Re-enable System Integrity Protection (SIP) if you haven't already:

Boot into Recovery Mode.

Open Terminal and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

Restart normally.

Your Mac is now securely configured against unwanted AirPlay-based screen sharing!

Great job! You've successfully secured AirPlay and applied firewall rules. Your router settings are in place, and System Integrity Protection
