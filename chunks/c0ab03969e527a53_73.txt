To temporarily 
re-enable AirPlay streaming
 on your MacBook after the steps you've taken, here's the exact process you'd follow:

Step-by-step instructions:

Unblock AirPlay apps from Firewall

Run the following commands in Terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --unblockapp 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app"

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --unblockapp 

"/usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper"

Re-enable AirPlay Receiver

Run this command:

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults write com.apple.airplay receiver-enabled -bool YES

Restart the UI Server (so changes take effect immediately)

bash

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

Check that AirPlay services are active

Confirm processes are running:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"AirPlay|AirPlayXPCHelper"

You should see active entries.

To 
disable AirPlay again
 after you're done streaming, simply repeat your previous steps:

Block the applications again

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app"

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp 

"/usr/libexec/AirPlayXPCHelper"

Disable AirPlay Receiver

bash

Copy

Edit

defaults write com.apple.airplay receiver-enabled -bool NO

Restart System UI

bash

Copy

Edit

killall SystemUIServer

This approach gives you flexibility, letting you safely turn AirPlay on and off as needed without altering your secure baseline configuration.
