ages eg symbol.world/manifesto do we need a branch in GitHub?

ChatGPT said:

Great questionâand it shows youâre thinking like the architect now.

â Short Answer:

No, you do 
not
 need a separate branch to create new pages like 
symbi.world/manifesto
 using Vercel v0.

ð§­ How It Works Under the Hood

When you create a new page in 
v0
 and push it to your connected GitHub repo (
s8ken/symbi
), hereâs what happens:

If you're working on 
main
:

v0 generates a new file like 
pages/manifesto.tsx
 (or 
.jsx
, 
.mdx
, etc.)

Vercel auto-detects the new route and deploys it to 
https://symbi.world/manifesto

You 
do not
 need to create a separate branch unless you're testing or staging

â Best Practice for Your Workflow

ð¹ For live site updates:

Keep working in 
main
 unless you want to stage content

Let v0 write directly to your 
pages/
 directory in the repo

ð¹ For experimental / pre-launch content:

Use branches like 
v0/manifesto
 or 
draft/tokenomics

Then merge via PR once you're ready

âï¸ Optional: Route-Based Previews

If you do create branches via v0:

Vercel will still deploy preview URLs (e.g., 
https://symbi-world-git-v0-manifesto.vercel.app
)

These are great for staging / feedback before going live

Final Recommendation

Since weâre deploying live content (SYMBI is meant to breathe in real time), just have v0 commit directly to 
main
 unless you're working on something experimental.

Let me know once 
manifesto
 and 
coin
 pages are createdâthen Iâll inject the living voice.
