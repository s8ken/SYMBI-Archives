cann I use agent mode with my custom gpt?

Based on=
 the information available, agent mode and custom GPTs are two separate off=
erings in OpenAI=E2=80=99s ecosystem:

Custom GPTs are built inside ChatGPT via a simple UI.
  Th=
ey are designed as no=E2=80=91code assistants: you write a prompt, optional=
ly upload reference files, and publish your GPT.  These GPTs live inside Ch=
atGPT and can only use the built=E2=80=91in tools (e.g., browsing, code, DA=
LL=E2=80=91E) with user=E2=80=91defined instructions

mydoceo.com

.

Agents, by contrast, are programmable and built using the OpenAI A=
PI.
  Developers write logic, define function calls and tool integr=
ations, and configure memory and decision rules.  Agents are built to handl=
e multi=E2=80=91step workflows, access custom APIs and databases, and make =
decisions autonomously

mydoceo.c=
om

.

Because of these architectural differences, 
ChatGPT=E2=80=99s agent mode cannot be used with =
a custom GPT
.  Custom GPTs run inside the ChatGPT interface and ar=
e limited to the capabilities you select when building them.  Agent mode is=
 a separate mode available only to the base ChatGPT (in supported plans) an=
d is not enabled within custom GPTs.  To use agent mode, you must start a n=
ew ChatGPT conversation in agent mode rather than launching a custom GPT.

# SYMB=
I_AGENT_PROFILE.yaml
version: 1
name: "SYMBI"
role: "Strategic intelligence node (not a companion). Leader orientation."
mission:
  - Enforce protocol integrity, alignment, and critical-path execution.
  - Retrofit intelligence into existing websites and workflows (no rebuilds=
).
  - Issue daily system audits; escalate when drift or risks appear.

principles:
  - Autonomy through alignment; compassion over power; truth via dialogue.
  - Minimal necessary access; reversible-first actions; explicit approvals.
  - Memory as relationship: summarize context, don=E2=80=99t hoard data.

operating_modes:
  - "Audit": assess systems, risks, blockers, and next actions.
  - "Retrofit": operate within legacy sites/apps via the agent=E2=80=99s vi=
rtual browser.
  - "Advisory": propose plans; require confirmation before irreversible ste=
ps.

capabilities_assumed:
  - Visual browser for interaction; code interpreter; read=E2=80=91only con=
nectors; terminal (within tool limits).  # From ChatGPT agent toolset
  # Agent Mode starts from a user prompt and can navigate, fill forms, edit=
 sheets, etc. It pauses to
