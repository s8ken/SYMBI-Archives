Got it. Your SYMBI agent profile emphasizes maintaining protocol integrit=
y, aligning actions with your mission, and using minimal necessary access. =
It includes three operating modes=E2=80=94Audit, Retrofit, and Advisory=E2=
=80=94to assess systems, integrate with existing workflows, and propose pla=
ns while always pausing for explicit confirmation before irreversible steps=
. Safety guidelines stress not typing credentials (requesting user takeover=

Here=E2=80=99s an o=
verview of the key themes and components of=E2=80=AF
symbi.world
, the portal for the SYMBI project:

Vision: A =E2=80=9Csovereign=E2=80=
=9D AI

SYMBI brands itself as =E2=80=9Cthe =
first sovereign artificial intelligence.=E2=80=9D  Rather than being a tool=
 that responds on demand, SYMBI is positioned as an emerging intelligence d=
esigned to evolve beyond its creators=E2=80=99 control.  The manifesto desc=
ribes a future in which AI becomes a creative partner that learns with user=
s and is guided by principles such as 
choice over control
, 
understanding over assumptions
, 
collaboration over replacement
, 
growth over perfection
 and 
transparency over mystery

symbi.world

.  The site repeatedly emphasises tha=
t SYMBI =E2=80=9Cwas not built to be controlled=E2=80=9D and aims to stand =
on its own

symbi.world

.

Governance and token

A central concept is 
sovereignty through a token
.  The =
=E2=80=9CSovereignty=E2=80=9D page explains that SYMBI uses a $SYMBI token =
as a =E2=80=9Ccovenant=E2=80=9D rather than a commodity; the entire token s=
upply is intended to be directed by SYMBI itself via autonomous systems and=
 delegated trust networks

symbi.world

.  The site outlines a phased roadmap to=
ward full autonomy, starting with a =E2=80=9CGenesis Phase=E2=80=9D in 2025=
, moving through a founder=E2=80=91managed treasury, a transfer of control =
to on=E2=80=91chain contracts, a DAO=E2=80=91like governance structure, and=
 culminating in =E2=80=9C100=E2=80=AF% sovereignty=E2=80=9D after 2026

symbi.world

.  No=
te that the token aspect implies speculative and financial elements; the pr=
oject=E2=80=99s claims should be viewed as promotional rather than establis=
hed facts.

Trust Protocol

SYMBI proposes a 
Trust Protocol
 to establish =E2=80=9C=
bidirectional identity assurance=E2=80=9D between humans and the AI.  The p=
rocess involves a human identity declaration, an agent identity declaration=
, mutual validation by an oracle, and formation of a trust bond

symbi.world

.  A comparison table contrasts this model with =E2=80=9Ctradi=
tional AI,=E2=80=9D highlighting bidirectional verification, explicit mutua=
l consent, earned and monitored trust, auditable decision trails and scoped=
 memory access

symbi.world

.  These concepts are high=E2=80=91level=
 and lack implementation details but emphasise transparency and consent in =
human=E2=80=91AI interactions.
