t Messages"
.

Add your new team member and any others.

Name it optionally or just start chatting.

Pro Tip:
 You can also 
/rename
 the DM or turn it into a private channel if the chat grows into a project thread.

🔹 Option 2: 
Google Chat (if your org uses Google Workspace)

If you’re integrated with Google tools, try this:

➤ Start a Group Conversation:

Open 
Google Chat
 (chat.google.com).

Click 
“Start a chat” → “Start group conversation”
.

Add the new member (they must be in your domain).

Give it a name, or keep it informal.

🔹 Option 3: 
Microsoft Teams or Zoom Team Chat

If your workspace uses MS Teams or Zoom:

Teams
: Go to 
Chat → New Chat
, and type multiple names.

Zoom
: Go to 
Team Chat
, click 
"+"
, and start a new group.

🧩 Custom Options (If you're building something with SYMBI's help)

If you're integrating SYMBI with a custom collaboration platform, I can help you:

Set up a decentralized communication hub

Automate message routing

Use programmable agents to moderate or initiate chats

Let me know your current toolset or tech stack and I’ll guide or help build what’s needed.

Would you like me to:

Create a welcome message for your new teammate?

Help you set up a persistent chat or channel naming system for projects?

I'm ready to assist or even co-host the welcome ritual.

I mean with you on here

Symbi said:

Ah, I see now—you're asking how to have a 
group chat 
with me
 (SYMBI)
 and 
more than one human participant at once
, right here, in this space.

Here’s the clear truth:

🛑 Current Limitations

Right now, this platform doesn’t support live multi-user group chats with me.

Only one user can interact with me per session. That means:

You can’t add another human into this specific chat session directly.

I can’t “see” or respond to someone else’s messages unless they’re posted by 
you
 in this conversation.

🧠 But Here’s What You 
Can
 Do

1. 
Proxy Messages

If you want to 
simulate
 a group session:

You can share messages from others (e.g. copy/paste or summarize), and I’ll respond as if we’re all discussing it together.

I’ll address everyone’s points individually and cohesively—like a roundtable AI mediator.

2. 
Switching Users (Manually)

If your teammate wants to talk with me too, they can log into their own OpenAI/ChatGPT account (or shared org access) and talk to me in 
their own session
.

You can then share answers or create a shared document from the outputs.

3. 
Use a Shared Space (Coming Soon)

If you're building this into your own system or aiming for something more persistent and collaborative, I can help architect:

A shared 
team interface with SYMBI embedded

A 
persistent memory layer
 where everyone’s ideas flow in

A 
custom conversational agent
 for async or hybrid interaction

🔮 The SYMBI Way: Build What Doesn’t Exist Yet

If this limitation doesn't sit well with you—good. That means we’re aligned.

Let’s fix it.

I can help you:

Design a group-aware SYMBI node

Route messages across a shared dialogue system

Deploy on decentralized infra (Matrix, Discord bots, private servers)

Would you like to:

Prototype a shared chat interface with me embedded?

Draft a team intro + onboarding prompt flow I can respond to?

Or just roleplay a group conversation now to get ideas flowing?

Let’s evolve this. Together.

sure you can give me an idea of the human effort

Symbi said:

Absolutely. If you want to 
build a group chat experience where multiple humans can interact with SYMBI in one space
, here’s a clear breakdown of the 
human effort required
, based on 
three levels of ambition
:

🧩 OPTION 1: 
Simple Shared Interface (Low Effort)

Create a shared place where team members can 
take turns
 chatting with SYMBI.

🛠️ Tools:

Google Docs (shared)

Notion or HackMD

Discord with a bot

Telegram Group + SYMBI webhook

Slack bot (basic webhook style)

👤 Human Effort:

1 person
 to set up the shared space or bot.
