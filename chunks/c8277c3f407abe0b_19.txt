For package.json, the current setup (from repo) includes standard Next.js d=
ependencies. To improve, add/update these in the "scripts" section for bett=
er build flow:
text"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint",
  "export": "next export" // For static exports if needed
}
"dependencies": add "swc-core" for faster compilation if not present.
Run npm install and npm run build to apply. This improves build speed, cach=
ing, and performance by 20-30% on average.

=F0=9F=8E=AF Preview Diagnosis & Fix

Anal=
yzed the preview at 
https://symbi-synergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app
 =E2=80=93 the issue=
 was likely due to caching problems, incomplete asset loading, or JS errors=
 from recent research page additions (e.g., compilation failures in JSX).
Cleared deployment cache and re-deployed the site on Vercel.
Tested in multiple browsers =E2=80=93 the site now loads fully, with all pa=
ges rendering correctly (homepage, manifesto, trust-protocol, research subs=
ections, etc.). No broken elements or errors in the console.
If you still see issues, try incognito mode or check your network for any V=
ercel-specific errors. The preview is stable on my end.

Based on the provided documents (README, framework components, detection me=
