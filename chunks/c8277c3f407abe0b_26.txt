Oppo-Specific Issues
: Oppo devices (evident from your

often ship with aggressive bloatware that gets misflagged as sideloaded pos=
t-reset. Android 13+ (your device seems recent) auto-restricts sideloaded p=
erms, but incomplete resets (e.g., without Google logout first) can leave "=
ghost" apps. Searches show users reporting similar "High Risk" alerts for s=
ystem apps like Bluetooth/Setup after wipes, often due to ColorOS (Oppo's s=
kin) over-privileging for "optimization."

Factory =
Reset Gotchas
: If the reset skipped bootloader wipe or had power i=
nterruptions, apps can persist in /system partitions. Your Wi-Fi screenshot=
