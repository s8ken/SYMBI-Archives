ssumes your Chromebook supports Linux apps (most do via Crostini, the built=

If your Chromebook is in Developer Mode, it's even easier, but that's optio=

Reset Commands
:

In the Chromebook Terminal:

Start ADB: 
adb devices
 (your phone should show up; if no=

adb kill-server
 then 
adb start-s=

).

Reboot to bootloader: 
adb reboot bootloader
.

Once in bootloader mode (your phone scre=
en will show "Fastboot" or similar), run: 
fastboot erase userdata
 (this wipes user data dee=

Reboot: 
fastboot reboot
.

Your phone will reset fully=E2=80=94back=

Caveats
:

If your bootloader is locked (common on =
stock devices), you may need to unlock it first via 
fastboot oem unlock
 (check your model s=
pecifics, as this voids warranty and wipes data).

Chromebooks may need USB-C hubs for olde=
r ports; test connectivity first.

If issues arise (e.g., "command not foun=

Safety: Only do this if you're sure=E2=
