noting, especially in=
 the context of your phone's post-reset weirdness and potential rooting/deb=
ugging history. I'll break it down:

1. 
The "checkro=
ot.internal.sh" Script (First Screenshot)
:

What It =
Does
: This is a Bash shell script designed to detect root access o=
n Android. It:

Loops through directories like 
/system/app
, 
/data/app
, 
/data/user/0
 (system and user ap=
ps).

Counts apps in each (expecting no more t=
han 2 in some dirs for a "clean" non-rooted system).

Checks user ID (
id
) to see if it's running as root (uid=
=3D0).

Outputs messages like "checkroot: access=
 to $dir > $count -> OK" or "id =3D $id is NOT root."

Unusual?=

: Mildly. This isn't stock Android behavior=E2=80=94it's a custom =
script, likely from a rooting tool, security scanner, or backup app (e.g., =
Magisk or NeoBackup uses similar checks). The "# ATTENTION! This expects mo=
re than two apps in each dir" comment suggests it's tuned to detect tamperi=
ng (e.g., extra apps indicating root mods). On a factory-reset device, seei=
ng this implies you (or someone) installed an app that bundles such scripts=
, possibly for debugging your sideloaded issues. No red flags for malice, b=
ut it's not "normal" for a vanilla phone.

2. 
DevTools Plu=
gins List (Second Screenshot)
:

What It =
Shows
: A list of "plugins" or special files in a dev tool interfac=
e (possibly from an app like "DevTools" or a root explorer). Items include:=

wifi.access.points
 and 
wifi.access.points.up.to.sdk29
: Likely regex or c=
onfig files for Wi-Fi scanning/access point management, up to Android 10 (S=
DK 29).

do.not.stop
: A regex file to prevent stopping certain pr=
ocesses/packages.

ignored_packages
: Regex to ignore specific packages (e.g=
., system ones).

checkroot
: The script from the first screenshot.

pause
 and 
tar
: Shell scripts for pausing or archiving (tar is a standard=
 compression tool).

Unusual?=

: Yes, somewhat suspicious. "do.not.stop" and "ignored_packages" c=
ould be for persisting apps or evading detection=E2=80=94e.g., in malware, =
this might hide sideloaded packages from scans. However, in context, this l=
ooks like plugins for a legitimate dev/root tool (e.g., Magisk modules or a=
 backup app's internals). The "InternalRegex" and "InternalShellScript" cat=
egories suggest it's from an app managing system tweaks. Tied to your sidel=
oaded apps, it might indicate remnants of a root attempt or security tool y=
ou installed to investigate the high-risk apps. Not inherently malicious, b=
ut odd for a reset device=E2=80=94check if you have apps like "Neo Backup" =
or "Magisk" installed.

3. 
ignored_pack=
ages.internal_regex File (Third Screenshot)
:

What It =
Does
: A regex file listing patterns for packages to ignore during =
scans or backups. Examples:

# *the* system
: Ignores core Android/Google packages lik=
e 
com.google.android.sy=
stemui
, 
com.goog=
le.android.externalstorage
, 
com.google.android.providers.media.b.*
.

Comments explain: "do not backup or rest=
ore packages that may use files in data directories of other apps" and "som=
e may be questionable if the stopping strategy is changed."

Unusual?=

: Not really=E2=80=94this is standard for backup tools to avoid me=
ssing with system-critical packages (e.g., avoiding boot loops). It's focus=
ed on Google/Android internals, which aligns with safe backup practices. Ho=
wever, the "# and anchored at both ends (^$)" note suggests precise matchin=
g to hide or protect specific apps, which could be abused in malware. In yo=
ur case, it might explain why some sideloaded apps persist or aren't flagge=
d properly.
