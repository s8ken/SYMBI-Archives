Ah, got it=E2=80=94thanks for clari=
fying! You're referring to linking your iPhone (via Apple CarPlay) and Andr=
oid device (via Android Auto) to the Audi's MMI (Multi Media Interface) sys=
tem for in-car infotainment, like navigation, music, and calls. This is a c=
ommon setup for Audi owners with multi-phone households, and it's fully sup=
ported on most modern Audis (e.g., MIB2+ or MIB3 systems from 2017+ models)=
. However, switching between them can be finicky, and there are some securi=
ty/privacy angles that might tie into your earlier concerns about sideloade=
d apps and device weirdness. I'll break it down based on the latest info (a=
s of October 2025), including common issues and risks.

How Linking Works (iOS + Android to Audi=
 MMI)

Audi=
's MMI supports 
separate setups
 fo=
r CarPlay (iOS) and Android Auto=E2=80=94no direct "linking" between your i=
Phone and Android devices, but you can connect either one independently via=
 USB or wirelessly (depending on your Audi model year). Here's the quick se=
tup:

For iPho=
ne (Apple CarPlay)
:

Requirem=
ents
: iPhone 5+ on iOS 7.1+ (iOS 18+ recommended for 2025 features=
 like enhanced Siri).

Wired
: Plug into the USB port in the center console (glovebox or armrest).=
 MMI prompts: Select "Apple CarPlay" > "Yes, agree."

Wireless=

 (2019+ models like A6/A7/A8/Q8): Enable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/Siri on i=
Phone. Go to MMI > Phone > Connect Mobile Device > Pair via Blueto=
oth (it'll show as "Audi_MMI_XXXX"). CarPlay launches automatically.

Switchin=
g
: In MMI, tap the source icon (e.g., radio/music) > Select "Ap=
ple CarPlay" to activate.

For Andr=
oid Device (Android Auto)
:

Requirem=
ents
: Android 6.0+ phone (e.g., your Oppo on Android 14). Download=
 the Android Auto app from Google Play if not pre-installed.

Wired
: USB connection, then MMI > Phone > Connect > "Android Auto=
."

Wireless=

 (2022+ MIB3 models like A3/A4/A5): Pair Bluetooth first (shows as=
 "Audi_MMI_#"), then enable Wi-Fi hotspot on phone. MMI detects and connect=
s.

Switchin=

In MMI: Go to Menu > Connection > =
Forget the previous device if needed, then pair the new one.

Pro Tip: For seamless swaps, use wired f=
or both=E2=80=94wireless can lag if multiple devices are nearby (MMI priori=
tizes the last connected). If your Audi has dual USB ports, you could theor=
etically have both plugged in, but only one activates at a time (manual swi=

Your=
 Oppo (OP5EA7L1, Android 14) should work fine with Android Auto, but Oppo's=
 ColorOS sometimes needs tweaks like disabling battery optimization for the=
 Auto app (Settings > Battery > App Optimization > Android Auto &g=
