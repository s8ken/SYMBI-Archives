with a dark history for somethi=
ng tied to "gifting" (often a red flag in Telegram's crypto/NFT scene) can =
seem tone-deaf or suspicious. Based on recent searches (up to October 2025)=
, I'll break down what "Project Mayhem" refers to historically, how it's re=
surfaced, its connection to "@mrkt gifting," and why your Telegram might be=
 acting up. This isn't financial advice, and I'll flag potential risks with=
out lecturing.

1. 
The Original=
 "Project Mayhem" Controversy (2023)

What It =
Was
: A Telegram channel (@projectmayhem or similar variants) run b=
y a white supremacist influencer (Paul Nicholas Miller, aka "Gypsy Crusader=
"). It coordinated doxxing raids=E2=80=94flooding targets (e.g., journalist=
s, activists) with hate mail, swatting threats, and harassment campaigns.

Issues
: It sparked widespread online hate, with victims reporting death th=
reats and privacy breaches. USA Today exposed it in May 2023 as a single-pe=
rson operation amplifying extremism. Telegram banned the channel, but echoe=
s lingered in fringe groups.

Why Cont=
roversial?
: The name nods to 
Fight Club
's anarchic "Proje=
ct Mayhem," but here it fueled real-world harm. No direct ties to scams, bu=
t it eroded trust in Telegram channels with that branding.

2. 
The Resurfac=
ing: New "Project Mayhem" (2025 Crypto/NFT Twist)

What's H=
appening Now
: A fresh Telegram channel (@project_soap) launched in=
 early 2025, explicitly branded as "Project Mayhem." It's themed around a "=
Tyler Durden" sticker/NFT collection (again, 
Fight Club
 reference=
=E2=80=94Tyler is the chaotic alter ego). It's not the old hate group=E2=80=
=94it's a crypto project promoting giveaways and trading on TON (The Open N=
etwork, Telegram's blockchain).

Core Foc=
us
: Users buy/sell "Tyler" stickers as NFTs/gifts via @mrkt (a min=
i-app marketplace). To join: Purchase stickers on @mrkt, then get access to=
 exclusive chats/giveaways.

@moremanUQ

@mrkt Gi=
fting
: @official_mrkt is Telegram's official NFT marketplace (laun=
ched May 2025), where users trade digital gifts/stickers using Telegram Sta=
rs (in-app currency). "Gifting" here means sending NFTs (e.g., rare sticker=
s worth $10=E2=80=93$100+ in Stars). Project Mayhem runs contests: "Subscri=
be to @project_soap, buy a Tyler sticker on @mrkt, win gifts."

Why Your Tel=
egram Feels "Unusual" (Likely Causes)

Resurfac=
ing Spam/Invites
: If you're in crypto/NFT circles (e.g., via SYMBI=
's TON integrations?), bots or groups might be spamming Project Mayhem invi=
tes or @mrkt links. Recent X posts (April 2025) show hype around Tyler's "p=
rivate chats" and refunds/gifts, leading to viral DMs. This could cause:

Unsolicited messages: "Join Project Mayh=
em giveaway on @mrkt=E2=80=94win free NFTs!"

Notification floods: Auto-joins or muted=
 group pings.

App glitches: Telegram's mini-apps (like=
 @mrkt) can lag or pop up ads if you interact.

@0xdamx

Gifting =
Scam Overlap
: Legit @mrkt is safe (TON-secured), but scammers mimi=
c it. Common ploy: "Gift" a fake NFT, then ask for "gas fees" or wallet acc=
ess. Telegram Premium gift scams surged in 2024=E2=80=932025, with 20% tied=
 to NFT "gifts." If your unusual behavior involves unsolicited gifts/DMs, i=
t's likely fraudsters riding the @mrkt wave.
