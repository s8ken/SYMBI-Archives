current "Project Mayhem" you're encountering on Telegram (@project_soap) is=
 a crypto/NFT project launched in early 2025, focused on sticker/NFT giftin=

Tyler Durden
=E2=80=94explicitly a reference to the chaotic character from 
Fight =

. No real name is publicly disclosed; he's described as a major "N=
FT Gift Whale" in the TON ecosystem, known for high-value trades like snagg=
ing a Green Gift NFT for 25,000 TON (~$100,000) in April 2025. This is dist=

olas Miller (aka Gypsy Crusader), which was banned for doxxing and hate cam=
