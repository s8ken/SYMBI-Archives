Unaware Admin in Telegram Groups: A Know=

The Tact=
ic
: Scammers (or group mods) add users as "admins" but revoke all =
privileges (e.g., no post/edit/delete rights). You're unaware because Teleg=
ram doesn't notify for low-perm adds, and it doesn't show in your profile u=
nless you dig (Group Info > Admins). This gives them:

Credibil=
ity Leverage
: They screenshot you as an "admin" to scam others ("E=
ndorsed by [your username]!").

Data Har=
vest
: Access to group metadata (e.g., member lists for spam/phishi=
ng).

Social E=
ngineering
: Later DM you: "As admin, approve this giveaway?" to ex=
tract info/wallet details.

Why Larg=
e Groups?
: Easier to hide in 10k+ member chats (e.g., TON/NFT comm=
unities). 2025 saw a 35% uptick in such scams, often in "trading" or "airdr=
op" groups mimicking legit ones like @mrkt. Project Mayhem's small size (~1=
7 subs) makes it less likely, but copycats in bigger channels could target =
you via invites.
