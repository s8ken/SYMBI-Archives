What Does E2EE Mean?

E2EE=
 stands for 
End-to-End Encryption

 It's a security protocol where messages, calls, or data are encrypted on t=
he sender's device and can only be decrypted on the recipient's device=E2=
=80=94meaning no intermediary (like the app's servers, ISPs, or hackers) ca=
n access the content in transit. Apps like Signal or WhatsApp use E2EE by d=
efault for chats and calls, ensuring privacy. Without it, servers can read =
or log data, opening doors to surveillance or breaches. It's crucial for se=
nsitive comms, but not all apps implement it fully (e.g., Telegram's defaul=
