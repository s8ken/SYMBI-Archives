Mechanis=

: Pulse intercepts or forwards calls via Android's Call Forwardin=

It routes the audio stream through its s=

Diverts metadata (location, duration) to=

For voicemail diversion: It uses carrier=

How Can This Be Used to Rebroadcast Some=

Call=
 diversion apps like Pulse introduce risks if misused, especially without E=

Backgrou=
