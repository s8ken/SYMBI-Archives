GCam saves photos/videos to Google Photo=

On ports, Google Photos is often require=

If you're seeing this package in GCam co=

or storage/processing.

With=

Gcam Services Provider

to run GCam ports on devices

Purpose
: Enables GCam on privacy-focused setups by simulating dependencies=
 (e.g., for photo viewing). Since April 2023, GrapheneOS has native GCam su=
pport via a built-in shim, so this app is mainly for the "view last photo" =
button without installing Google Photos.

How It W=
