Thanks for clarifying=E2=80=94since you=E2=80=99ve already found GCam =
(likely a port) installed on your Oppo (OP5EA7L1, Android 14), it explains =
why you're questioning its presence, especially given your earlier concerns=
 about sideloaded apps and unusual device behavior. The fact that it=E2=80=

ut its origin and potential implications. Let=E2=80=99s dive into why it mi=
ght be there, its connection to the 
com.google.android.apps.photos
 package and the 
lukaspieper/gcam-services-provi=
der
 GitHub project, and what to do next.

Why Is GCam on Your Oppo?

GCam=
 isn=E2=80=99t officially supported on non-Pixel devices like your Oppo, so=
 its presence suggests one of these scenarios:

Preinsta=
lled by Oppo or Carrier
:

Some Oppo models (especially mid-to-high=
-end ones like the Reno or Find series) ship with Google apps preloaded via=
 ColorOS=E2=80=99s Google Mobile Services (GMS) integration. However, GCam =
itself (package 
com.goo=
gle.android.GoogleCamera
) is typically Pixel-exclusive in official f=
orm. Your OP5EA7L1 might have a custom ROM or a carrier-bundled version mim=
icking GCam (e.g., a rebranded camera app with GCam-like features).

Check: Settings > Apps > Show Syst=
em > Search for 
com.=
google.android.GoogleCamera
. If it=E2=80=99s there with a version (e=
.g., 9.6.19), it=E2=80=99s likely a port or OEM tweak.

Sideload=
ed Post-Reset
:

Given your earlier issues with sideloade=
d apps (e.g., "Android Setup" with high-risk perms), someone (or a process)=
 might have installed a GCam APK. Ports are widely distributed on sites lik=
e celsoazevedo.com or via Telegram groups (e.g., your Project Mayhem exposu=
re). The 
lukaspieper/gc=
am-services-provider
 could have been bundled to support it on a de-G=
oogled setup.

Check: File Manager > Storage > Lo=
ok for an APK named 
GCa=
m_*.apk
 or similar in 
/sdcard/Download
.

Automati=
c Installation via Google Photos
:

The 
com.google.android.apps.photos
 package (Google Photo=
s) often auto-installs related Google apps if linked to your account. If yo=
u restored a backup post-reset with Google Photos active, it might have pul=
led GCam as a dependency=E2=80=94though this is rare without user action.

Check: Google Photos > Settings > =
Backup & Sync > See if it=E2=80=99s tied to a Pixel or GCam data.

Malware =
or Misidentification
:

A malicious app could masquerade as GCam=
, using a similar package name (e.g., 
com.google.android.apps.ph
 typo could be a spoof). Yo=
ur Oppo=E2=80=99s weirdness (e.g., Wi-Fi glitches, battery drain) might hin=
t at this, especially if perms like 
CAMERA
 or 
RECORD_AUDIO
 are overactive.

Check: Settings > Apps > GCam >=
 Permissions > Revoke anything unusual (e.g., mic access).

Give=
n your Oppo=E2=80=99s stock nature (no mention of rooting), option 1 or 2 i=
s most likely. The GitHub project suggests someone tried optimizing it for =
a minimal Google setup, which aligns with your privacy concerns.
