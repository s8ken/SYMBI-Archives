It looks like you're encounteri=
ng permission issues while trying to run the 
sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-t=
ools-adb android-tools-fastboot
 command on your Chromebook's Linux e=
nvironment (likely via Crostini, given the 
stephen@penguin
 prompt). The errors indicate tha=
t the APT package manager cannot access or modify the required directories =
(
/var/lib/apt/lists/
 and 
/var/cache/apt=
/
) due to insufficient permissions. This is a common issue when the =
Linux container's filesystem permissions are misconfigured or when you're n=
ot running the command with the correct privileges in the right context. Si=
nce it=E2=80=99s 07:57 PM AEDT on Friday, October 10, 2025, let=E2=80=99s r=
esolve this quickly so you can proceed with resetting your Oppo A3x.

Why This Happened

Permissi=
on Denied
: The 
sudo
 command elevates privileges, but if the Linux container's file=
system is mounted read-only or owned by a different user (e.g., the rootfs =
setup in Crostini), APT can't write to its cache or lock files.

Crostini=
 Specifics
: ChromeOS's sandboxed Linux environment sometimes requi=
res a restart or permission fix after initial setup, especially if the cont=
ainer was recently created or updated.

Lock Fil=
e Issue
: The 
/=
var/lib/apt/lists/lock
 error suggests another process (e.g., a previ=
ous APT session) might be holding the lock, or the directory permissions ar=
e off.

Steps to Fix and Install ADB/Fastboot

Foll=
ow these steps carefully on your Chromebook:

Restart =
the Linux Container
:

Exit the Terminal: Type 
exit
 or close the window.

Open Settings > Advanced > Develop=
ers > Linux > Click "Turn Off" (this stops the container).

Wait 10 seconds, then "Turn On" to resta=
rt it. This resets permissions and clears locks.

Reopen Terminal and log back in (
stephen@penguin:~$
 shou=
ld reappear).

Run the =
Command Again with Sudo
:

Type: 
sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-tools=
-adb android-tools-fastboot

Enter your Chromebook password (set duri=
ng Linux setup) when prompted.

If it works, you=E2=80=99ll see package =
lists updating, followed by ADB/Fastboot installation. Ignore the "WARNING:=
 apt does not have a stable CLI interface" unless scripting=E2=80=94this is=
 a standard Debian caution.

Fix Perm=
issions Manually (If Step 2 Fails)
:

If the error persists, the directories m=
ight need ownership correction:

sudo chown -R stephen:stephen /var/lib/apt

sudo chown -R stephen:stephen /var/cache/apt

Then retry the command.

Note: Replace 
stephen
 with your actual username (check w=
ith 
whoami
).

Clear Lo=
cks (Alternative)
:

If a lock file is the issue, remove it m=
anually:

sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock

sudo rm /var/cache/apt/*.bin

Retry the command. This deletes stale lo=
cks=E2=80=94safe if no other APT process is running.

Verify I=
nstallation
:

After success, check: 
adb --version
 and 
fastboot --version
 should displa=
y versions (e.g., 1.0.41 for ADB).

If not found, ensure the PATH is updated=
