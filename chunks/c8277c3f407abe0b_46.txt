Next Steps for Oppo Reset

Once=
 ADB/Fastboot is installed:

Connect your Oppo A3x via USB.

Enable USB Debugging (Settings > Abou=

.

In Terminal: 
adb devices
 (authorize on phone).

adb reboot bootloader
 > 
fastboot erase userdata
 > 
fastboot reboot
.
This wipes all data, addressing sideloaded apps like GCam.

Updated Steps to Fix and Install ADB/Fas=
tboot

Let=
=E2=80=99s try a systematic approach, tailored to your updated Chromebook:

Restart =
the Linux Container
:

Exit the Terminal: Type 
exit
 or close the window.

Go to Settings > Advanced > Develo=
pers > Linux > Click "Turn Off" to stop the container.

Wait 10=E2=80=9315 seconds, then "Turn O=
n" to restart it. This clears locks and resets permissions.

Reopen Terminal and log in (
stephen@penguin:~$
 should a=
ppear).

Re-run t=
he Command with Sudo
:

Type: 
sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-tools=
-adb android-tools-fastboot

Enter your Chromebook password (set duri=
ng Linux setup) when prompted.

Watch for output: It should fetch packag=
e lists, then install ADB/Fastboot. The "WARNING: apt does not have a stabl=
e CLI interface" is normal and safe to ignore.

Manual P=
ermission Fix (If Step 2 Fails)
:

If you get the same errors, adjust owner=
ship:

sudo chown -R stephen:stephen /var/lib/apt

sudo chown -R stephen:stephen /var/cache/apt

Replace 
stephen
 with your username (confirm with 
whoami
 if unsure).

Retry the command.

Clear St=
ale Locks (If Still Failing)
:

Remove lock files:

sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock

sudo rm /var/cache/apt/*.bin

Retry the command. This is safe if no ot=
her APT process is active.

Verify I=
nstallation
:

After success, test: 
adb --version
 and 
fastboot --version
 should show ve=
rsions (e.g., 1.0.41).

If commands aren=E2=80=99t found, update=
 PATH: 
export PATH=3D$P=
