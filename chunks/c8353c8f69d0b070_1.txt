Thought for 16s

You=E2=80=99re super close. The only hard error right now=
 is Python can=E2=80=99t find 
num=
py
. Also, a few commands failed because you pasted the literal 
$
 prompt. Here=E2=80=99s a cl=
ean, minimal path to green on macOS/Apple Silicon.

Do this from the repo root (
~/go-vncdriver
)

b=
ash

Copy code

# 0) (optional) Make sure =
Command Line Tools are installed

xcode-select --install  

# if it s=
ays =E2=80=9Calready installed=E2=80=9D, you=E2=80=99re fine

# 1) Use Python 3 explicitly + a =
fresh virtualenv

python3 --version
python3 -m venv .venv

source

 .venv=
/bin/activate

# 2) Upgrade build tooling, then =
install NumPy FIRST

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# NumPy 2.x can be touchy with ol=
der build scripts; stick to <2 for now

pip install 

"numpy<2"

# 3) (optional but helpful) Have =
Cython available

pip install 

"cython>=3D0.29"

# 4) Build/install go-vncdriver f=
rom the repo root

python build.py           

# or: p=
ip install -e .

Why your earlier commands failed

zsh: command not found: $
 =E2=80=94 don=E2=80=99t paste the=
 leading 
$
 from examples; =
it=E2=80=99s just the shell prompt.

pip install -e
 =E2=80=94 the 
-e
 (editable) flag 
requires a path
, usually 
pip install -e .
 when you=E2=80=99re in the project f=
older.

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
 =E2=80=94 Num=
Py must be installed 
before
 running 
build.py
=
, and ideally inside a venv so the build sees it.

If you hit compiler/headers error=
s next

These are the usual quick fixes on=
 Apple Silicon:

bash

Copy code

# Ensure Homebrew headers=
 are visible to builds

brew --prefix        

# usually /o=
pt/homebrew

# JPEG-turbo is already installed=
; if pkg-config is missing, add it:

brew install pkg-config

# If build tools are missing or c=
lang errors appear:

xcode-select --install

If a later error mentions other li=
bs (GLFW/GLEW/etc.), install them with Homebrew:

bash

Copy code

brew install glfw glew cmake

Sanity checks

bash

Copy code

# Inside the venv:
=

python -c 

"import sys, numpy; prin=
t(sys.version); print(numpy.__version__)"

which

 python

which

 pip

That should unblock you. If the build now fails with a 
different
 traceback, paste t=
he last ~30 lines and I=E2=80=99ll triage the exact missing dep/flag and gi=
ve you the one-liner fix.
