Ah, y=
ou're encountering the 
new =E2=80=
=9CService Account=E2=80=9D feature on OpenAI's platform
 =E2=80=94=
 part of their recent 
Team and =
Enterprise features
 that allow for more fine-grained access contro=
l and automation.

Let me explain what you're seeing:

=F0=9F=A7=BE "Owned by" =E2=80=93 W=
hat It Means in OpenAI

When creating a new API key at 
http=
s://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

, you'll now see an option that says:

"Owned by"

=E2=9E=A4 
[your user]

=E2=9E=A4 
[service account]
 (if you have permission)

This allows you to choose 
who =E2=80=9Cowns=E2=80=9D the key
:

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option 1: 
Your User (personal key)

Key is tied to your own user identity

Has access 
only to what 
you=

 have access to

Ideal for testing, personal scripts,=
 or one-off use

=F0=9F=94=B9 Option 2: 
Service Account

Key is tied to a non-human =E2=80=9Cbot=E2=80=9D identity
=

You or your admin set up a 
service account
 with specific r=
oles or scopes

Ideal for 
shared scripts
, 
production apps
, and 
automated tasks

Safer
 for teams: you can rotate keys or revoke access =

without affecting a human use=
r

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why Use a Service Ac=
count in OpenAI?

If you're building something in 
V0.dev
, or deploying a=
n app with 
shared access
, the 
service account key=

 is a good option because:

You don=E2=80=99t risk exposing yo=
ur own personal user key

You can manage its permissions ind=
ependently

It scales better in a team or prod=
uction setup

=E2=9C=85 When Should 
You
 Use a Service Account?

Use a 
service account key
 if:

You're building an app for 
production

You're working in a 
team or organization

You want 
audit control
, or plan to rotate the key regu=
larly

Use a 
user-owned key
 if:

You're 
just testing
 or building a quick prototype

You=E2=80=99re working 
solo
 and don=E2=80=99t want to =
set up a service account yet

=F0=9F=92=A1 Pro Tip

If you're using 
v0.dev
 to call OpenAI's API, either ke=
y type will work =E2=80=94 just be careful:

Service Account Key
: safer for team/production

User Key
: faster for quick testing

However, if you're referring to the =
