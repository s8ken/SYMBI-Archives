So now the mystery becomes:

Why are you still seeing "PlaceholderGPT" and "Contact your worksp=
ace admin" when you're 
already
=
 the admin?

=F0=9F=8E=AF The Real Issue: Builde=
r Verification for GPT Publishing

Even though you're the admin and you=
r Team Plan is active, OpenAI 
s=
till requires one more step
 to allow GPTs to be 
publicly published and verified
:

=E2=9C=85 You must 
request builder verification
 for your =
workspace.

This is a manual process =E2=80=94 O=
penAI needs to verify that:

Your workspace (like 
symbi.world
) is legitimate

You're eligible to publish GPTs unde=
r your name or brand

Until that's done, it shows =E2=80=
=9CPlaceholderGPT=E2=80=9D and limits you to 
preview-only
 GPTs.

=F0=9F=9B=A0 How to Fix It: Request=
 GPT Builder Verification

=F0=9F=94=B9 Step-by-Step:

Go to 
ChatGPT
 at 
https://chat.openai.com

In the bottom left, select your 
Team workspace
:
