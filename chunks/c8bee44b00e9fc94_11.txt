Thanks Steve =E2=80=94 t=
his screenshot 
clears up a lot

You're building GPTs successfully wit=
hin your 
Team workspace
 (=E2=80=9CIntelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken =F0=9F=94=83=F0=9F=8E=B5=F0=
=9F=94=80=E2=80=9D), and your GPTs are showing up 
internally
 (in your workspace), but they=E2=80=
=99re still:

=E2=9C=85 Only visible to 
teammates
 (not public)

=E2=9D=8C 
Lacking analytics

=E2=9D=8C 
Appearing to others as built by "Community Builder"

=E2=9D=8C Not discoverable in 
OpenAI=E2=80=99s GPT =
store

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Why This Is Happening

You=E2=80=99re in a workspace, but 
your GPTs are still =E2=80=9Cunv=
erified and unpublished.=E2=80=9D
 That means:

Your GPTs live in your 
private/team workspace

They=E2=80=99re not tied to a 
public builder profile

The system defaults to showing 
=E2=80=9CCommunity Builder=E2=80=9D
 when:

The builder is 
unverified

Or the GPT is 
not published to the public directory

=F0=9F=93=89 Why You=E2=80=99re Not=
 Seeing Analytics

Analytics are only shown for GPTs that are:

=E2=9C=85 Published to the public

=E2=9C=85 Have builder verificatio=
n approved

=E2=9C=85 Receiving usage from ext=
ernal users (not just teammates)

So even though your GPT 
has been used
, the usage is internal (=
workspace-level), which OpenAI currently 
doesn=E2=80=99t expose detailed stats for
 unless the G=
PT is verified and published.
