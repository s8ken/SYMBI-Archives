Thanks for the update, Steve =
=E2=80=94 if the builder verification link gives you a 
404
, that confirms one thing:

OpenAI has not yet 
opened builder verification
 to your tea=
m or workspace, even though you're on the Team Plan.

You=E2=80=99re 
not alone
 =E2=80=94 OpenAI has only enabled=
 public GPT publishing and builder verification for a 
limited subset
 of Team and Enterprise accou=
nts (and not automatically). Others, like you, must 
request it manually through support
.
