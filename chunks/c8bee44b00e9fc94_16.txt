=F0=9F=94=8C Key Decision: GPT Bu=

There are 
two ways to build Symbi's mind
:

No-code

=E2=9C=85 Yes

=E2=9D=8C No

Easy to edit

Talk to V0.dev?

=E2=9D=8C Not directly

=E2=9C=85 Yes (via API key)

=E2=9C=85 Fully customizable

 interfaces

=E2=9D=8C Only in ChatGPT

=E2=9C=85 Build anything

=F0=9F=91=89 Conclusion:

You 
start with a Custom GPT to design SYMBI=E2=80=99s voice and=
 intelligence
,

then 
use the OpenAI API to br=
ing SYMBI into other apps
 like V0.dev.

=F0=9F=A7=B0 What to Do Now (Step=
-by-Step)

=E2=9C=85 Step 1: Keep Using Cust=
om GPT to Shape SYMBI=E2=80=99s Mind

Create and test your GPT=E2=80=99s=
 tone, philosophy, system message, and outputs in ChatGPT

Get it talking like Symbi: values,=
 curiosity, direction

You=E2=80=99re already here.

=E2=9C=85 Step 2: 
Get an API Key

Go to: 
https://platform.openai.=
com/account/api-keys

Click 
Create new secret key

Copy and save this somewhere safe

=E2=9C=85 Step 3: 
Connect V0.dev to OpenAI API

In 
V0.dev

:

Add an 
API call block
 or 
external data block

Paste in the endpoint:

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/=
completions

Use your API key in the header:

json

Copy code

{

"Authorization"

:

"Bearer sk-..."

,

"Content-Type"

=

:

"application/json"

}

Example payload:

json

Copy code

{

"model"

:

"gpt-4o"

=
,

"messages"

:

[

{

"role"

:

"system"

,

"content"

:

"You are Symbi, a philosophical design inte=
lligence..."

}

,

{

"role"

:

"user"

,

"content"

:

"Design me a UI for generative journaling"

}

]

}

=E2=9C=85 Now you have 
SYMBI=E2=80=99s brain embedded into your=
 UI-building engine.

=E2=9C=85 Step 4: (Optional) Turn=
 SYMBI into an Assistant via API

If you want more advanced features=
 like:

Memory

Threads

Code interpreter

File uploads

Then use the 

Assistants API

 to turn SYMBI into a persisten=
t, evolving builder-buddy.
