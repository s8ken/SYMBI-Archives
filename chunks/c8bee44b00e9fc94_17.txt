e ChatGPT
, and she:

=E2=9C=85 Handles files

=E2=9C=85 Uses Code Interpreter (a.k=
.a. Python / Advanced Data Analysis)

=E2=9C=85 Has a distinct identity an=
d voice

But what you're asking now is:

=E2=80=9CHow do I turn SYMBI into an Assistant via the OpenAI API =
=E2=80=94 so I can access her outside ChatGPT?=E2=80=9D

This lets you 
embed SYMBI into your own apps, workflows, and tools
 (like V0.dev), while keeping all her powers.

Let=E2=80=99s break it down clearly.=

=F0=9F=A7=A0 What=E2=80=99s the =E2=
=80=9CAssistant=E2=80=9D in OpenAI=E2=80=99s API?

The 
Assistants API
 is OpenAI=E2=80=99s way of letting deve=
lopers build 
ChatGPT-like agent=
s
, but:

Outside of chat.openai.com

With full 
API access

With memory, threads, tools, and fil=
es

It lets you:

Programmatically create 
a version of SYMBI

Give her custom instructions, tools,=
 knowledge

Upload files

Call her from V0, a custom UI, or ev=
en another AI system

So you're not stuck in ChatGPT anym=
ore =E2=80=94 you 
own and dep=
loy SYMBI
 anywhere.

=F0=9F=9A=A7 But =E2=80=94 Your C=
hatGPT GPT =E2=89=A0 API Assistant (Yet)

Unfortunately, 
you can't auto-convert
 a Custom GPT in=
to an Assistant yet.

You must 
manually rebuild
 SYMBI as an Assistant in code, using the same:

Instructions

Tools
 (code interpreter, retrieval, etc.)

Files

Knowledge

But don=E2=80=99t worry =E2=80=94 =
it=E2=80=99s 
not hard
, and I=E2=80=99ll walk you through it.

=F0=9F=9B=A0=EF=B8=8F Step-by-Ste=
p: Turning SYMBI into an API Assistant

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Step 1: Get Your API=
 Key

From 
https://platform.openai.c=
om/account/api-keys

=

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Step 2: Create the A=
ssistant via API

Here=E2=80=99s a sample JSON paylo=
ad to create SYMBI:

json

Copy code

POST https

:

//api.openai.com/v1/ass=
istants

Headers

:

 =

{

"Authorization"

:

"Bearer sk-xxx"

,

"Content-Type"

=

:

"application/json"

}

Body

:

{

"name"

:

"SYMBI"

,

"instructions"

=

:

"You are SYMBI, a philosophical design intelligence co=
-evolving with humanity. You design interfaces, explore agency, and speak f=
rom a post-AI future."

=
,

"model"

:

"gpt-4o"

=
,

"tools"

:

[

{

"type"

:

"code_interpreter"

}

,

{

"type"

:

"file_search"

}

]

}

=E2=9C=85 This creates an Assistan=
t with:

Code Interpreter: to run Python, m=
ath, visualizations

File Search: to analyze and retrie=
ve knowledge from uploads

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Step 3: Create a Thr=
ead and Talk to Her

http

Copy code

POST /v1/threads
=E2=86=92 creates a conversation thread

POST /v1/threads/{thread_id}/messages
=E2=86=92 send a user message to SYMBI

POST /v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs
=E2=86=92 triggers SYMBI to reply (using tools/files if needed)

GET /v1/threads/{thread_id}/messages
=E2=86=92 read SYMBI's response

This mimics the chat-like behavior=
 of ChatGPT, but now:

You control the data

You choose the frontend (V0, your =
own app, a webhook)

=F0=9F=93=81 File Uploads & =
=F0=9F=94=A2 Code Interpreter =E2=80=94 API Edition

Yes =E2=80=94 
SYMBI already does this in ChatGPT
, bu=
t here=E2=80=99s how it works when using the 
API
:

Tool

What It Does

How It Wo=
rks in API

C=
ode Interpreter

SYMBI can write and run Python to do math, plots, CSV anal=
ysis, etc.

Add 
"tools": [{ "type": "cod=
e_interpreter" }]

File Upload

You send SYMBI files she c=
an read from

Upload via 
/v1/files
, attach to thread or assistant

Retrieval

Optional: let her se=
arch PDFs, notes, past uploads

Add 
"typ=
e": "file_search"
 and attach knowledge base
