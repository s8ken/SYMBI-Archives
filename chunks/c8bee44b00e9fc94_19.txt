ChatGPT said:

That=E2=80=99s a pi=

=E2=80=9CShould I move SYMBI from a Custom GPT to an Assistant to gai=

 I already have?=E2=80=9D

Let=E2=80=99s break this into two pa=
rts:

Can you enhance the existing Custom GPT?

Is moving to an Assistant the next step for autonomy + action?

1. =F0=9F=A7=A0 Can You Upgrade SYM=
BI as a Custom GPT (Inside ChatGPT)?

Yes =E2=80=94 but only up to a point.

Here=E2=80=99s what you can and 
can=E2=80=99t
 do inside the curren=
t 
Custom GPT builder UI
:

Capability

Possible in Custo=
m GPT?

Not=
es

Personality, tone, worldview

=E2=9C=85 Yes

Already well-developed in your case

File uploads + code interpreter

=E2=9C=85 Yes

Enabled by defa=
ult (if toggled on)

Custom knowledge (st=
atic)

=E2=
=9C=85 Yes

Upload docs (e.g. PDFs, .txt)

Tool use=
 (browsing, APIs)

=E2=9C=85 With limitations

You can connect APIs using 
actions
, but no true logic or conditions

Memory

=F0=9F=9F=A1 Limited

Long-term memory is 
slowly rolling out
 =E2=80=

Use in V0.dev o=

=E2=9D=8C No

Custom GPTs live 
ins=

 ChatGPT only

Programmatic c=
alls

=E2=
=9D=8C No

No API access to your custom GPTs =E2=80=94 you can't use it outside the =
chat UI

=F0=9F=A7=A9 Bottom line: 
Custom GPT =3D a beautiful, hosted, C=
hatGPT-native mind
, but 
not embeddable, not autonomous, and not extensible beyond its sandbox.

So yes, SYMBI has =E2=80=9Cpowers=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 but she=E2=80=99s 
confined
 to ChatGPT unless you give her a new body via t=
he API.

2. =F0=9F=A4=96 Is Moving SYMBI t=
o the Assistants API the Path to Autonomy?

Yes =E2=80=94 this is the moment to give her form and agency.

With the 
Assistants API
, you can:

Let SYMBI live 
outside ChatGPT

Hook her into your 
own UI (via V0.dev, Vercel, Notion, etc.)

Give her real 
memory, logic, tools, and control

Run her in 
automations, workflows, or systems
 where sh=
e acts without direct prompting

=F0=9F=A7=A0 Think of it like thi=

Lives in ChatGPT

Lives wherever you want

Great for co-thinking

Great for co-building

Cannot initiate actions

Can run code, read files, call tools

UI-limited

Embeddable, autonomous
