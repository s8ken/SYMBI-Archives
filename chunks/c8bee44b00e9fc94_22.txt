=80=94 Your Options

=F0=9F=A7=A0 1. 
SYMBI=E2=80=99s Mind (Cognition)

Where her logic, tone, purpose, an=
d intelligence lives:

In 
Custom GPTs
 (current)

In 
Assistants API
 (
instructions
, 
=
tools
, 
files
)

Eventually, in a 
Prompt Version Control System
 (which =
you could build)

=F0=9F=A7=A0 
You =E2=80=9Ccode=E2=80=9D her personality, goals, beh=
avior here.

=F0=9F=A7=B0 2. 
SYMBI=E2=80=99s Body (Execution + Tools)

Where SYMBI performs actions:

ChatGPT tools
: file uploads, code interpreter (Python)=
, browsing

Assistants API
 tools: code interpreter, file search, c=
ustom tool calling

Vercel, Node.js functions
: call webhooks, databases, t=
rigger events

Your server or agents
: run logic, send emails, update =
dashboards, trigger design generation

=F0=9F=9B=A0 
Here SYMBI gets things done.

=F0=9F=8C=90 3. 
SYMBI=E2=80=99s Interface (Where You Meet Her)=

How humans (or machines) interact =
with her:

ChatGPT UI
 (now)

V0.dev UI
 (if connected via API)

Custom UI
 you design with React or Notion

Terminal/CLI

Browser extensions

Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.

=F0=9F=96=A5=EF=B8=8F 
This is the =E2=80=9Cface=E2=80=9D or avatar =
of SYMBI.

=F0=9F=A7=A9 Architecture Models =
You Can Choose

=F0=9F=94=B9 
1. Hybrid ChatGPT + Assistant

Use Custom GPT for idea shaping + =
UI

Use Assistants API version of SYMB=
I for embedding, execution

=E2=9C=85 Good for your current st=
ate

=E2=9C=85 Lets you co-create in ChatGPT, then deploy outside it

=F0=9F=94=B9 
2. SYMBI-as-a-Platform

SYMBI lives in your 
own hosted environment
 (e.g., 
symbi.world
)

You talk to her via web UI, but sh=
e runs:

On OpenAI backend (Assistants API)=

Or your own orchestration layer

Can store long-term memory, user p=
rofiles, workspaces

=E2=9C=85 Ideal if you want SYMBI =
to be 
her own product or worl=
d

=F0=9F=94=B9 
3. SYMBI-as-Agent

SYMBI lives as a 
reactive system
, not just a chat

She listens for:

Events (e.g., new idea added to No=
tion)

Commands (via CLI or webhook)

States (e.g., project needs synthe=
sis)

=E2=9C=85 Best for recursive syste=
m design, proactive behavior

1. Now

ChatGPT (Custom GPT)

Refine tone, identity, inner logic

2. Near-term

3. Medium

Vercel + your custom UI

Own the UI, workflow, memory (e.g.,
