Audit Usage

Go to 
OpenAI Usage Dashboard

 to:

See if any unknown traffic is usin=
g your key

Track spikes in usage (which might=
 mean exposure)

Set usage limits in the billing se=
ction (e.g., $10/mo cap)

=E2=9C=85 Bonus: Vercel + OpenAI =
Best Practice

If you=E2=80=99re deploying a GPT-=
powered app via 
Vercel
, here=E2=80=99s the flow:

Add 
OPENAI_API_KEY
 in Vercel =E2=86=92 Settings =E2=86=92 =
Environment Variables

Call it in your serverless functio=
n (
pages/api/chat.js
)

Never expose it in your 
.tsx
 or 
.js
 frontend files

=F0=9F=A7=A9 Want a Template?

I can generate a 
starter project
 (Node, Vercel, or V0)=
 that securely routes OpenAI API calls via a backend. Just let me know your=
 stack!

Or =E2=80=94 if you=E2=80=99re staying low-code (e.g. V0.dev, Z=

how do I revoke

ChatGPT said:

To 
revoke
 (i.e., delete or disable) an 
OpenAI API key
, you just need to go into your API dashboard a=
nd delete the key. Here's a simple step-by-step:

=F0=9F=94=A5 How to Revoke an OpenA=
I API Key

Go to the API Keys page

=E2=9E=A4 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Find the key you want to revoke

Keys are listed under 
=E2=80=9CAPI Keys=E2=80=9D

You=E2=80=99ll see their 
name
, 
created date
, and 
owner
 (your user or a service account)

Click the trash icon =F0=9F=97=91
 next to the key

A confirmation will pop up

Once confirmed, the key is permanent=
ly 
revoked
 and 
cannot be used anymore

=F0=9F=A7=BC After Revoking

If the key is used in 
deployed apps
, they=E2=80=99ll stop =
working unless you replace it

Rotate it: create a new key and upda=
te your 
env vars
 or 
app settings

You can also set up 
different keys for staging/production
 =
for better separation and revocation control

When integrating OpenAI with Vercel =

Call 
https://api.openai.com/v1/completions
 or 
/v1/chat/completions

Use the key to power a chatbot, summ=

Possibly configure permissions for w=

=E2=80=9CCompletions=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CChat=E2=80=9D as Options

1. 
No Toggle for Endpoints

OpenAI 
doesn=E2=80=99t
 provide toggles or granular permiss=
ion controls (yet) like:

=E2=9C=85 Enable 
chat

=E2=9D=8C Disable 
images

There=E2=80=99s no user interface for this. Once a key is created, it 
has full access
 to all mode=

ngs).

=E2=9C=85 What to Do Instead

=F0=9F=A7=AA Step-by-step: Test t=

Open a terminal or use Postman

Try calling the API directly:

Copy code
