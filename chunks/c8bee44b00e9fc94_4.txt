gs =E2=86=92 Environment Variables

Ensure the key is 
the full service account key
 (starts=

)

Make sure it=E2=80=99s used in 
backend code only
, not =
exposed in frontend files

=F0=9F=94=84 If Using V0.dev with=
 Vercel

You paste the API key inside the a=
ction or logic block that connects to OpenAI
