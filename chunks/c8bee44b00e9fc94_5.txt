V0.dev, paste the full endpoint URL and key i=
nto the action setup.

=E2=9C=85 Checklist to Fix

=E2=9C=85 Use this 
exact endpoint
:

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/=
completions

=E2=9C=85 Confirm the key starts w=
ith 
sk-
 and is not expir=
ed or revoked

=E2=9C=85 Test with 
curl
 or Postman to verify it's not a V=
ercel/V0 issue

=E2=9C=85 Use backend to call Open=
AI API, not frontend browser directly (or it will expose the key)

Would you like to paste your code or setup here (redact the key=
), and I=E2=80=99ll check it line-by-line for issues?

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Let=E2=80=99s break this down, becau=
se 
service accounts use a diffe=
rent endpoint and authentication flow
 from regular 
sk-
 keys.

=F0=9F=94=90 Service Account Keys W=
ork Differently

When you use a 
Service Account key
 in OpenAI, the key is 
not
 a direct-use 
sk-
 string.

Instead, it=E2=80=99s a 
JSON key file
 that includes:

client_email

private_key

project_id

And more...

You cannot use this key directly with curl or fetch.

You must first exchange it for an 
access token
 using 
OAuth 2.0 JWT flow
. Then yo=
u use 
that token
 in th=
e 
Authorization
 header.

=E2=9C=85 Here's How to Use a Servi=
ce Account with OpenAI's API

=F0=9F=94=81 1. Generate an Access =
Token

You need to:

Create a 
JWT (JSON Web Token)
 signed with your service acc=
ount's private key

Exchange it for an access token via=
:

bash

Copy code

POST https://auth.openai.com/oauth2/token

With this payload:

json

Copy code

{

"grant_type"

:

"urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer"

,

"assertion"

:

"<your-signed-jwt>"

}

(You can do this in Node.js, Pytho=
n, or with Google=E2=80=99s 
goo=
gle-auth-library
.)

=E2=9A=99=EF=B8=8F 2. Use the Acc=
ess Token

Once you have the token, then you =
call:

bash

Copy code

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

With:

http

Copy code

Authorization: Bearer <access-token>

=E2=9C=85 Now your request will wo=
rk!

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Why You're See=
ing =E2=80=9CPage Not Found=E2=80=9D

You likely tried to call the OpenA=
I API with the raw 
service ac=
count key
 like this:

bash

Copy code

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer <se=
rvice-account-private-key>"

 \
  ...

This 
doesn=E2=80=99t work
, and OpenAI will return 
404
 or 
401
.

=F0=9F=9B=A0 Want a Working Code =
Sample?

I can generate a 
Node.js
 or 
Python
 snippet that:

Loads the service account JSON

Exchanges it for an access token

Calls the 
chat/completions
 endpoint securely

u prefer.
