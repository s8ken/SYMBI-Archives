You've:

=E2=9C=85 Signed up on 
platform.openai.com

=E2=9C=85 Created a 
Service Acc=
ount

=E2=9C=85 Downloaded a 
JSON key=
 file

=E2=9C=85 Gave that file to Vercel or something else

=F0=9F=9A=AB But when you try to call the API (like 
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
) it sa=
ys 
Page Not Found

=F0=9F=9A=A7 Why It=E2=80=99s Not W=
orking

The problem is: 
Service Account keys are 
not
 =E2=80=9Cplug and play=E2=80=9D like regular API k=
eys
.

They are like ID badges =E2=80=94 y=
ou need to 
use them to request =
a temporary access pass
, called an 
Access Token
, before you can talk to the OpenAI API.

=E2=9C=85 The Beginner-Friendly W=
ay to Fix It

Since you=E2=80=99re using 
Vercel
, and possibly 
V0.dev
 or a no-code tool, =
you have two beginner-friendly options:

=F0=9F=94=B9 
Option 1: Skip the Service Account =E2=80=94 Us=
e a Regular API Key Instead

This is 
best for solo builders
 or beginners.

Go to: 
https://platform.openai.=
com/account/api-keys

Click 
"Create new secret key"

Copy the 
sk-xxxxxxxx...
 key

Paste it into your Vercel environm=
ent, V0.dev, or any API setup

In Vercel: Project =E2=86=92 Setti=
ngs =E2=86=92 Environment Variables =E2=86=92 
OPENAI_API_KEY

=E2=9C=85 This key 
works immediately
 with the 
/v1/chat/completions
 endpoint

=F0=9F=9A=AB Don=E2=80=99t put it directly into frontend files =E2=80=94 al=
ways use it in backend or secure environments

=F0=9F=94=92 It=E2=80=99s just lik=
e a password =E2=80=94 keep it private

=F0=9F=94=B9 
Option 2: Stick With the Service Account (Advan=
ced)

If you 
really
 want to use the Service Account securely=
 (for team apps or production):

You=E2=80=99ll need to:

Use code to 
sign the key
 (JWT)

Exchange it for a 
temporary token

Call the API with that token

But since you said you're new to c=
ode, 
I recommend Option 1 for=
 now
 =E2=80=94 it'll save you hours of complexity.

=F0=9F=A7=A9 What Do You 
Want to Build
 with the API?

If you tell me:

What you=E2=80=99re trying to crea=
te (e.g. chatbot, prompt app, summarizer, etc.)

What tools you=E2=80=99re using (V=
0.dev? Vercel? No-code? Bubble?)

I=E2=80=99ll walk you through the =

simplest possible version
 that works securely =E2=80=94 without needing to write code.

=F0=9F=A7=98 TL;DR

If you=E2=80=99re okay with using =
a 
regular API key
, I=
 can show you 
exactly how to =
hook it up to V0.dev or Vercel
 =E2=80=94 just say the word.

Or if you still want to use the service account route, I can gu=

ChatGPT said:

Thanks Steve =E2=80=94 this error message:

"Missing bearer or basic authentication in header"

Type: 
invalid_request_error

means that the OpenAI API is rejecti=
ng your request because it 
does=
n=E2=80=99t see any API key or access token
 in the request headers=
.

This is super common and easy to fix=
.

=E2=9C=85 What the API Expects

Every request to OpenAI=E2=80=99s AP=
I 
must include an 
Authorization
 header
 that look=
s like this:

h=
ttp

Copy code

Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Or, if using a 
service account
, it needs:

h=
ttp

Copy code

Authorization: Bearer <OAuth access token>

But in your case, you're probably:

Using a 
service account key file directly
 (invalid here),

OR didn't add the 
Authorization
 header correctly in your req=
uest setup

=F0=9F=94=A7 Your Fix (Beginner-Fri=
