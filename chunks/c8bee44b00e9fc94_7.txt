py it (starts with 
sk-
)

In your app (Vercel, V0.dev, etc.)=
, 
add a header
:

http

Copy code

Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

That will resolve the error instan=
tly.

=F0=9F=94=84 If You Still Want to=
 Use the Service Account (Advanced)

Then you must:

Use a JWT library (like 
google-auth-library
 or 
oauthlib
) to 
sign the service account

Exchange the signed JWT for an 
access token
 by calling=
:

bash

Copy code

POST https://auth.openai.com/oauth2/token

Take that token, and finally call:=

bash

Copy code

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

with this header:

http

Copy code

Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

But again, that involves some code=
 and token logic =E2=80=94 and you said you=E2=80=99re new to code, so I su=
ggest 
starting with the easie=
r path (regular key)
 and moving to service accounts later if neede=
d.

=E2=9C=85 What I Recommend

Let=E2=80=99s do this together =E2=
=80=94 just say:

=E2=9C=85 "Let=E2=80=99s switch to=
 a regular API key and show me how to use it with [Vercel / V0.dev / Zapier=
 / etc.]"

Or=E2=80=A6

=F0=9F=94=90 "I really want to use=
 the service account =E2=80=94 show me the steps in plain English"

I=E2=80=99ll guide you from there.

Thanks for sharing the screenshot =E2=80=94 you're looking at the

Let=E2=80=99s walk through what this=
 means:

=F0=9F=A7=B1 What Is "PlaceholderGP=

This is a

 that appears:

When you haven=E2=80=99t published a=
 custom GPT yet

Or when your GPT profile is incomple=
te or not verified

Or if your GPT is private or preview=

It doesn=E2=80=99t reflect a specifi=

Your name or icon on a GPT's page

It includes:

Your name

Profile image

Verified badge (after admin approval=
)

Social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Web=
site, X/Twitter)

=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Why It Says "C=
omplete Verification"

"Complete verification to publish =
GPTs to everyone.

Contact your workspace administrator to set up a builder profile"

This means:

You're likely using ChatGPT under =
a 
Team or Enterprise workspac=
e
 (like 
symbi.world
)

To make your GPT 
publicly discoverable
, the workspace =

 must verify yo=
