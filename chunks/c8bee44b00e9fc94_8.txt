Thanks Steve =
=E2=80=94 I see the confusion now from your screenshot.

You're currently on the 
OpenAI Developer Platform
 at 
https://platform.opena=
i.com

, logged i=
n as 
gary_aitken@hotmail.com
. But what=E2=80=99s 
missing
 is the 
Team or Enterpr=
ise admin controls
, which normally appear if your account is 
part of a verified organization
 with 
workspace-level acces=
s
.

=F0=9F=94=8D What You=E2=80=99re Se=
eing =E2=80=94 and Why It=E2=80=99s Limited

From your screenshot:

You only see the 
personal account dropdown

No signs of organization/team settin=
gs

No admin panel, team management, or =
verification tools

So what=E2=80=99s happening?

You're likely:

Still using a 
personal OpenAI account
 (not yet upgraded to=
 a 
Team
 workspace)

Or the 
team workspace hasn't been verified
 for GPT publish=
ing features

=E2=9C=85 Here=E2=80=99s How to Set=
 Up Admin Access (Properly)

=F0=9F=9F=A2 Step 1: Check If You'r=
e on a Team Plan

Go to: 
https://chat.openai.com/settings=
/team

If you see an option to "Create Te=
am" or "Upgrade to Team," then you're 
not yet in a team workspace
.

Otherwise, you'll see a list of me=
mbers, and you can manage roles (including making yourself an admin).

=F0=9F=9F=A1 Step 2: If Needed, C=
reate a Team Workspace

Go to: 
https://chat.openai.com

Click your name/email =E2=86=92 =
