what do you make of these

This appears to be a WhatsApp=
 Service Extension log file from a Mac, showing the app's startup and conne=
ction sequence. Here's what I can see from analyzing the log:

Key I=
nformation

Device
: MacBoo=
k Pro (14-inch, 2021) running macOS 15.5

WhatsApp version
: 2.25.14.77

Time
: May 31, =
2025, 3:24-3:25 AM

Process
: Servi=
ce Extension (likely for notifications)

What =
Happened

Startup Phase (03:24:56-03:24:57)
:

WhatsApp Service Extension laun=
ched successfully

Initialized various components =
(databases, storage, crypto systems)

Memory usage started at ~9MB fo=
otprint, grew to ~16MB

All database loads succeeded qu=
ickly (0.00-0.01 seconds each)

Connection Attempt (03:24:57-03:25:17)
:

Attempted to connect to WhatsAp=
p servers (g.whatsapp.net)

Tried connecting to IP 157.240.=
8.54:5222

Connection was in "Connecting" =
state for about 20 seconds

Connection failed
 after ~14.5 seconds with error code -14

Termination (03:25:17)
:

Service extension was auto-canc=
elled after 20 seconds (typical timeout)

Disconnected from network

Cleaned up resources and shut d=
own

Notab=
le Observations

Performance
: T=
he app initialized very quickly with all storage systems loading in millise=
conds

Memory usage
: =
Reasonable footprint (9-16MB) for a service extension

Network issue
:=
 The connection failure suggests either network connectivity problems or se=
rver-side issues

Error code -14
=
: This appears to be a "happyeyeballs" error, likely related to IPv4/IPv6 d=
ual-stack connection attempts failing

This =
looks like a normal startup sequence that encountered a network connectivit=
y issue, causing the notification service extension to fail and terminate.

I notice this is the exact sa=
