This is a much shorter log fi=
le compared to the previous WhatsApp Service Extension log. Here's what I c=
an see:

Log D=
etails

Device
: Same M=
acBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) running macOS 15.5

WhatsApp version
: Same version 2.25.14.77

Time
: May 31, =
2025, at 5:37:54 AM (about 2 hours after the previous log)

Process
: WAApp=
KitBridgeService (PID: 1552)

Launch ID
: ADA=
7290D-ED3B-43E9-92C9-B147587CE588

Key O=
bservations

Different service
: This is the "WAAppKitBridgeService" rather than the "ServiceExtension"=
 from the earlier log

Empty content
:=
 The log appears to contain only the header information with no actual exec=
ution logs

Time gap
: This=
 occurred about 2 hours and 13 minutes after the failed service extension a=
ttempt

Possi=
ble Interpretations

The W=
AAppKitBridgeService likely handles communication between WhatsApp's main a=
pp and macOS system services. The fact that this log is essentially empty c=
ould mean:

The service launched but immedi=
ately terminated

The service launched successful=
ly but had no significant events to log

There was an issue with logging=
 itself

The service was launched but di=
dn't need to perform any operations

This =
contrasts sharply with the detailed startup sequence we saw in the ServiceE=
xtension log, suggesting this bridge service either had a very brief lifecy=
cle or encountered an immediate issue preventing normal logging.

Do yo=
u have any other related log files from around this time period that might =
provide more context?
