Overview of the Repositories

Base=
d on a detailed analysis of the three repositories=E2=80=94
SYMBI-Symphony
, 
SYMBI-R=
esonate
, and 
SYMBI-Vault
=E2=80=94they =
collectively form the foundational pillars of the 
SYMBI Framework
, an open-source ecosystem for ethical, cons=
titutional AI governance and human-AI collaboration. SYMBI stands for 
Symbiotic Constitutional AI
, emphasizin=
g principles like constitutional supremacy, measurable quality (via CIQ met=
rics: Clarity, Integrity, Quality), cryptographic trust (e.g., trust receip=
ts), progressive decentralization, and sovereignty without speculation.

SYMBI-Sy=
mphony
: An enterprise-grade orchestration platform for managing au=
tonomous AI agents at scale, focusing on workflow coordination, real-time m=
onitoring, and secure integration.

SYMBI-Re=
sonate
: A research and analytics lab for detecting "emergence" (co=
nsciousness-like behaviors) in AI models, with multi-agent experimentation,=
 trust scoring, and ethical evaluation tools.

SYMBI-Va=
ult
: The canonical artifact repository for the SYMBI Framework, ho=
using whitepapers, research kits, schemas, and partnership materials to ena=
ble replication, governance, and deployment.

Thes=
e repos are all in active early-stage development (roadmaps target 2024 mil=
estones, with no published releases or packages noted), use permissive lice=
nses (MIT primary, with CC BY-NC-SA for non-code assets in Vault), and shar=
e a TypeScript/Node.js core (with Python extensions in Vault). They lack pu=
blic metrics like stars/forks (likely due to low visibility or recent creat=
ion), but demonstrate strong internal consistency through shared terminolog=
y, integrations, and goals. Below, I break down the analysis across the req=
uested dimensions, drawing from READMEs, architectures, and documented feat=
ures.

Coherence with One Another

The =
repositories exhibit 
high coherence
 (8.5/10), forming a tightly integrated ecosystem where each serves a dist=
inct but interdependent role in the SYMBI Framework. They share a unified v=
ision of ethical AI governance, with explicit cross-references and technica=
l integrations that suggest a modular, layered architecture: Vault as the f=
oundational "constitution," Resonate as the evaluative "lab," and Symphony =
as the operational "conductor."

Coherence Score (1-10)

Evidence of Integration

Thematic Ali=
gnment

All revolve around ethical human-AI symbiosis: con=
stitutional principles (Vault), trust/emergence detection (Resonate), and s=
calable orchestration (Symphony). Shared concepts include CIQ metrics, trus=
t receipts/protocols, and multi-agent systems.

- Sympho=
ny explicitly integrates "SYMBI Vault" for secret management and references=
 "Trust Framework" (echoing Resonate's Trust Protocol).
- Resonate's SYMBI Framework (5D scoring: Reality Index, Trust Protocol, Et=
hical Alignment, Resonance Quality, Canvas Parity) directly builds on Vault=
's CIQ metrics and trust receipts.
- Vault positions itself as the "canonical" source, with replication kits t=
