Code Level Implementation

 (7.5/10), with clean, modular TypeScript codebases emphasizi=

Overall
: Modular (e.g., shared scoring=

Positives

Ethical =
Innovation at Core
: Unlike generic AI tools, SYMBI embeds governan=
ce (e.g., constitutional engine, emergence detection) as first-class citize=
ns, making it a pioneer in "provable symbiosis." This could attract impact-=
driven users/funders.

Modular =
Scalability
: Layered design allows mixing (e.g., use Vault's recei=
pts in Symphony without Resonate). Enterprise features like Helm, Prometheu=
s, and multi-cloud support punch above weight for open-source.

Research=
-Ready Rigor
: Double-blind experiments, statistical outputs, and r=
eplication kits (Vault/Resonate) enable peer-reviewable work=E2=80=94rare i=
n AI repos. 5D/CIQ scoring provides quantifiable ethics.

Open &am=
p; Transparent Model
: MIT licensing, Open Collective funding, and =
detailed roadmaps foster community trust. Comprehensive docs (SECURITY.md, =
CONFIGURATION.md) lower onboarding friction.

Security=
/Compliance Focus
: Built-in (RLS, OWASP, GDPR) reduces liability=
