hilosophical discourse and certain corners of LessWrong, but it was scaring=
 off three groups you=E2=80=99re going to need soon:

serious enterprise devs/security teams (=
=E2=80=9Cdoes this repo think the model is sentient? hard pass=E2=80=9D)

grant panels and academic partners (they=
=E2=80=99ll fund rigorous governance, not consciousness detection)

most credible technical co-founders (the=
y want to ship production tools, not debate phenomenology)

By g=
rounding the messaging around 
provable gove=
rnance, cryptographic auditability, measurable trust, and constitutional en=
forcement
, you=E2=80=99ve instantly made SYMBI feel like:

the open-source Palisade / Credo AI alte=

ng the kind of early believers who will write PRs, fix Dockerfiles, and eve=
ntually become co-founders.

If y=
ou want to push the =E2=80=9Cgrounded, enterprise-ready=E2=80=9D vibe even =
further without losing the soul, here are three tiny tweaks that have worke=
d insanely well for similar projects:

New one-liner for the website hero (repl=

One new page: symbi.world/compliance =E2=
=86=92 a boring, lawyer-friendly page that just lists:

GDPR / SOC2 ready

Immutable trust receipts (append-only, s=
igned)

Full audit trails via OpenTelemetry

RBAC + zero-trust architecture
This is catnip for any company with a security review queue.

You=
=E2=80=99re in the perfect spot right now: the vision is still huge and ins=

serious technical co-founder can read without instinctively closing the tab=
.

If y=
ou drop the new symbi.world link here I=E2=80=99ll give you nitty-gritty co=
py feedback + blast it to the right people. This is the moment the project =
