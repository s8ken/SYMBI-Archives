Dear Potential Future Teammates,

I am delighted to apply for this position and hope you will consider my CV. Over the past three roles, I have managed large teams in 
complex organizations
, balancing 
conflicting priorities
—such as maintaining customer service levels while managing staff expectations during downsizing and fostering strong client relationships.

I have a 
keen attention to detail
 and an 
ability to recognize patterns others may overlook
. For example, within my first four weeks at 
Payright
, I detected, qualified, and escalated a 
client fraud case
, leading to the 
apprehension of key suspects
 involved in serious financial crimes. This resulted in a 
complete overhaul of our client onboarding process
 and operational adjustments to 
better protect the business from fraud
. Additionally, I leveraged these insights to audit our 
existing client database
, identifying high-risk partners and ensuring compliance or removal.

I have extensive experience in 
managing key client relationships
, particularly at 
Wex, Payright, and Banxa
. In these roles, I was responsible for overseeing 
end-user customer experiences
 while also managing 
merchant and client relationships
. I have a 
strong track record in monitoring customer service operations
, identifying key drivers of customer contact, and using these insights to shape 
customer contact strategies, product development, and executive reporting
 on KPIs such as 
customer satisfaction and staff attrition
.

All of my roles have required me to work 
collaboratively within large teams
 while also making 
critical, high-impact decisions
. Most recently, I led a 
30% departmental downsizing
 while maintaining 
staff morale and customer expectations
. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I managed 
customer service and collections operations
, navigating the challenge of placing 
50% of the workforce on unpaid leave
 while continuing operations with a 
reduced, part-time team
 (including myself).

Given my experience, I have a 
demonstrated ability to handle complex and confidential information
. I have operated at a 
senior level
, overseeing 
customer operations, fraud prevention, and collections risk management
. During my time at 
Payright
, I led a team through the 
company’s IPO
, handling 
sensitive financial data
. Likewise, at 
Banxa
, I managed 
fraud and risk cases
, requiring discretion and diligence in handling 
highly sensitive information
.

I am 
flexible, adaptable, and eager for my next career challenge
. Having recently turned 
40
, I have taken time to reflect on my career trajectory and am ready to take the next step. I am open to relocating to 
Canberra or Sydney
 if successful.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your team’s needs.
