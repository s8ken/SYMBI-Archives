Title
: "sample=
s from automatic evals"

Scale
: This is=
 a massive commit that added 197,243 lines across 9 files

Content
: The c=
ommit appears to contain automatic evaluation samples, likely used for trai=
ning or evaluating language models on instruction-following tasks

The f=
iles added include what appear to be various evaluation datasets or sample =
collections (the GitHub interface shows "Large diffs are not rendered by de=
fault" for most files due to their size).

Based=
 on the repository name and the nature of this commit, this appears to be r=
elated to OpenAI's research on training language models to better follow hu=
man instructions using human feedback - likely related to their work on tec=
hniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) that were us=
ed in developing models like ChatGPT.

The s=
pecific URL fragment you included (
#diff-922d91e519bcd64faf83d9cc9402338133fc9d85=
0a0ef402c861ab361c16dcac
) suggests you were looking at a particular =
file diff within this commit, but the large size of the files means GitHub =
isn't rendering the full content by default.
