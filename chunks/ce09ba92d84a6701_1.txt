Near-term adds (this week)

Changelog
: small

 that auto-summarizes each release and updates KPI =
methodology diffs (helps regulators/auditors). 

YCQ Sonate

Security note
: one paragraph on how signatures/receipt=
s are stored, rotation policy, and privacy posture. 

YCQ Sonate

Docs stub
: minimal 
/docs
 index that mirrors npm README sections (DID method, =
VC schema, revocation, verifier API).

Ops checks

Ensure the =E2=80=9Cmethodology=E2=
=80=9D link actually resolves (404s kill trust). 

YCQ Sonate

Wire a basic uptime + error budget=
 monitor for the verifier endpoint.

Add a simple cookie-less analytics=
 (Plausible) to track clicks on receipts/CTA.

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll draft th=

Methodology
 page (=
definitions + formulas + examples) and a 
Trust Receipt Verifier
 snippet next so it=E2=80=99s sh=
