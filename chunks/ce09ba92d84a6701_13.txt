y note: =E2=80=9CAudibility=E2=80=9D =3D how well something can be heard. I=
 suspect you meant 
Auditability
 (ability to verify). If it=E2=80=99s intentional wordplay, it=E2=
=80=99s memorable but could confuse. Here are clean options either way:

Tight taglines

Awareness through Auditability.

Auditability =E2=86=92 Awareness.

Trust is Awareness, Proven.

See it. Check it. Trust it.

Make Outcomes Audible, Make Decisions Auditable.

(bridges both words)

If you keep =E2=80=9CAudibility=E2=

 If you love the =E2=80=9CAudibility=E2=80=
