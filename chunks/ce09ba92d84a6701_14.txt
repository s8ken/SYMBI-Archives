what about other threads do you get acces=
s to them?

Sho=
rt answer: I only see 
this
 conversation and any files you upload here. I don=E2=80=99t have automat=
ic access to your other ChatGPT threads or workspace chats unless you paste=
/export them or share files.

If you want cross-thread continuity,=
 two quick options:

Export the other threads (or paste t=
he key bits) and I=E2=80=99ll consolidate them into a single 
Continuity Log
 with decisions, open =
items, and owners.

Drop summaries/bullets per thread, a=
nd I=E2=80=99ll merge them into the same log plus a unified checklist.

Want me to spin up a canvas =E2=80=
=9CContinuity Log=E2=80=9D now and we can paste in anything you want preser=

I tr=

If the archives page is new, private=
, or blocked to crawlers, two quick ways to proceed:

Share the direct URL (if it=E2=80=99=
s a different path) or export the content here, and I=E2=80=99ll fold it in=
to a single Continuity Log.

Or give me a static dump (HTML/PDF) =
and I=E2=80=99ll parse and summarize it.

Meanwhile, based on what=E2=80=99s p=
ublic on symbi.world, here=E2=80=99s the ultra-short continuity snapshot to=
 align with YCQ:

Positioning:

Bridging copy for YCQ:
 You can safely reference the Tr=

If you can drop the archives text =
(or confirm the exact URL), I=E2=80=99ll ingest it and produce:
