Here=E2=80=99s how to use it safely w=
ithout letting summary drift bite us:

What to assume

Treat the Archives as 
AI-derived secondary notes
, not the =
primary record.

They=E2=80=99re great for narrative/=
ethos; risky for exact figures, dates, and repo mappings.

Quick safety layer (drop-in)

Provenance banner (on Archives + any page quoting it):

Derived from conversations between 
SYMBI =E2=86=94 Stephen (Feb=E2=
=80=93Oct 2025)
, summarized by an external model (Claude). Figures=
 are validated against live repos and receipts.

30-minute validation sweep (do this=
 once, then you=E2=80=99re clear)

Numbers & dates:
 Lock the three public counts that ma=

025=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9C70+ pages=E2=80=9D). If any differ from your own exp=
ort, use your export and note =E2=80=9C=E2=89=88=E2=80=9D.

Repo mapping:
 Ensure every mention resolves to the curren=

Claims with stakes:
 Anything about KPIs, coverage %, o=
r compliance =E2=86=92 cross-check against the new
