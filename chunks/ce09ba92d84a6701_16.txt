Th=

Nice=E2=80=94saw the new 
/demo
 page. Here=E2=80=99s the quick tig=
hten-up so it=E2=80=99s YC-ready and consistent with what we built.

What=E2=80=99s good

Clear demo creds and a single 
Launch Interactive Demo
 CTA.=

YCQ Sonate=

Strong protocol walkthroughs (DID me=
thods, VC issuance, Status List 2021, audit chain).

Performance + coverage badges alread=
y on-page (47ms, 95% cache hit, 95% test coverage).

Add these 5 things (today)

Wire the verify flow

Add buttons under the demo CTA: 
Get Demo Receipt
 =E2=86=92 
Verify in Browser
 (opens 
/verifier.html
 preloaded). This connects the narrative to a=
 tangible proof. (We already drafted the UI + API.)

Link methodology

Under =E2=80=9CProduction Performance Metrics,=E2=80=9D add: 
View methodology & assumptions =E2=86=92 =

/metrics-methodology

 so the 95% number is anchored.

Public key endpoint mention

In the =E2=80=9CCryptographic Audit Trail=E2=80=9D or after the verify butt=
ons, add: 
Public verify key
 =E2=86=92 
/.well-known/=
ycq-receipt-pubkey
. This reassures reviewers the receipts are third-=
party verifiable. 

YCQ Sonate

Tagline lock

Place the subhead =E2=80=9C
Aw=
areness through Auditability
=E2=80=9D above the =E2=80=9CComplete =
Trust Protocol Flow=E2=80=9D or above the buttons to emphasize proof-over-c=

Demo limits note near creds

You already mention limits lower on the page=E2=80=94mirror it right under =
the email/password so folks don=E2=80=99t miss it (3 convos =E2=80=A2 10 ms=
gs =E2=80=A2 24h purge). 

YCQ Sonate

Nice polish (if you have 15 mins)=

Make the 
Launch Interactive Demo
 button open in a new =
tab and keep a small =E2=80=9CRequires JavaScript=E2=80=9D hint, since the =
Vercel app shows that when JS is disabled. 

Sym=

Add a tiny =E2=80=9CHow to verify=
=E2=80=9D 3-step list above the buttons: 
Mint =E2=86=92 Paste/Preloaded =E2=86=92 Click Verify
.

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll paste th=
