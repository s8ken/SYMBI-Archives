nks from each matrix row to a sample receipt.

[Methodology]

- Ship the KPIs (FAR=E2=80=91A, FAR=E2=80=91H, PFI, TIS) with =
formulas, targets, and CI rules.

- Publish comp=
lexity normalization weights and keep stable; log diffs in /changelog.

[SEO]

- Embed JSON=E2=80=91LD: SoftwareApplication on homepage; T=
echArticle on /metrics-methodology.

- Verify Op=
enGraph/Twitter image paths; add canonical URLs.

[Analytics]

=
- Add Plausible (cookie=E2=80=91less) and track clicks on: CTAs, =E2=80=9CV=
iew methodology=E2=80=9D, and receipt verifier.

[Reliability]

- Uptime check for verifier endpoint; error budget alerting.

[Change=E2=80=91log]

- Create /changelog with version tags (YYYY.MM.DD=E2=
=80=91rN) and methodology diffs.

Implementation no=
te

: If any KPI names must change to match existing in=
ternal terminology, keep the acronyms but swap long=E2=80=91form labels in =
the public page and record the alias in 

/changelog

. Ensure all percentages and indices include confidence inter=
vals and sample sizes next to the headline figures.

Done. I drafted the full 
/metrics-methodology
 page (with =
formulas, sampling/CI rules, guardrails matrix, JSON-LD, and a changelog te=
mplate) and added a 
prompt-read=
y fixes checklist
 you can paste straight into your ops prompt/back=
log.

Want me to also spin up a tiny JS ve=
rifier snippet for Trust Receipts (drop-in 
<script>
 + demo HTML), or wire the JSON-LD into your=
 current page markup?

You said:

symbi can you confirm=
 if these are in the product remote repo at SYMBI synergy? (GitHub.com/s8ke=
n/SYMBI/synergy) or is this a required product improvement as well\

Symbi s=
aid:

Thought for 37s

Short answer: some pieces exist in=
 the SYMBI-SYNERGY repo, but the exact items we just specced (methodology p=
age, in-browser receipt verifier, guardrails matrix, JSON-LD, changelog pag=
e) are not clearly present as shippable assets. Here=E2=80=99s what I can v=
erify from the public tree vs. what still looks like a product improvement:=

What I can confirm in 
s8ken/SYMBI-SYNERGY

Repo has site/app scaffolding and in=

Trust foundations and docs are prese=
nt (e.g., 
DID_VC_INTEGRATION.md
, 
SCORING_ALGORITHM.md
, security/privacy docs), suggesting the plumbing is there.

Items from our checklist that I do =

not
 see as ready-made

/metrics-methodology
 page
 (markdown or route): not visible in the repo listing/sear=
ch I can access. Mark as required improvement. 

GitHub

In-browser Trust Receipt Verifier
 (pure JS + demo HTML=
): not apparent in 
website/
 or 
frontend/
. Requir=
ed improvement. 

GitHub

+1

Guardrails matrix
 (page/section wired to sample receip=
ts): not found as a dedicated page/component. Required improvement. 

GitHub

JSON-LD blocks
 (SoftwareApplication on homepage, TechA=
rticle on methodology): not obvious in the website tree. Required improveme=
nt. 

GitHub

Public 
/changelog
 page
 (route with versioned diffs): I don=E2=80=99t see a sit=
e page; you do have planning docs (e.g., SHIP_READY_IMPROVEMENTS.md), but n=
ot a public route. Required improvement. 

GitHub

Plausible analytics wiring
: can=E2=80=99t confirm. Req=
uired improvement.

Related repo to leverage

The 
trust-protocol
 code/tests live in 
SYMBI-Symphony
 (includes tarball, te=
sts, and docs). We can reuse verifier primitives from there, but the websit=
e-level verifier UI still needs adding in SYNERGY. 

GitHub

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll open a P=
R to SYMBI-SYNERGY that adds:

/website/pages/metrics-methodology.md(x)
 (content from the=
 canvas)

/website/public/verifier.html
 + 
verifier.js
 (Ed25519 + hash-chain check)
