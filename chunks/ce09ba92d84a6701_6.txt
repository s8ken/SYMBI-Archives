 can you confirm you can see all the repos clearly now as there is a new Op=

Short answer: I can clearly see the 
public
 repos, but I don=E2=80=99t hav=
e visibility into any 
private
 workspace repos the new OpenAI integration might expose. From what=
=E2=80=99s public today:

SYMBI-SYNERGY
 =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9CAI Trust First Platform=
=E2=80=9D app layer (YCQ-facing). 

GitHub

SYMBI-Symphony
 =E2=80=94 trust-protocol core with DID/VC,=
 revocation, tests, and a 
website=
-materials/
 bundle; it also contains folders named 
SYMBI SYNERGY
 and 
SYMBI RESONATE
 inside the mono-repo. A tagg=
ed release exists (
v0.1.0
).

SYMBI-Resonate

YCQ-Sonate

I 
cannot
 see any additional repos or private branches tha=
t might be available via your new OpenAI workspace integration from here; i=
f there are private org repos, I=E2=80=99ll need either public links or exp=
licit shared access to confirm them.

Clean mapping (pick one =E2=80=9C=
source of truth=E2=80=9D per layer)

Core trust protocol:

SYMBI-Symphony
 (versioned, release tag v0.1.0).

Website badge copy

=9CBacked by SYMBI Symphony v0.1.0 (W3C DID/VC, revocation, audit trails).=
=E2=80=9D Link to the release.

Product/app layer (YCQ offering):

SYMBI-SYNERGY
 =E2=87=92 marketed as 
YCQ Sonate
.

Website truth
: yseeku.com sh=
ould point to SYNERGY for app features and to Symphony for protocol underpi=
nnings.

Research/metrics layer:

SYMBI-Resonate
 (emergence/ethics research).

an R&D initiative, not a runtime dependency.

What this means for the site (acc=
uracy without renaming code)

Keep the site copy: 
=E2=80=9CBuilt on SYMBI Trust Protocol (Sym=
phony v0.1.0)=E2=80=9D
 and 
=E2=80=9CYCQ Sonate powered by SYNERGY.=E2=80=9D

Link protocol docs/examples to 
Symphony
; link product =
features, verifier UI, and KPIs to 
SYNERGY / YCQ-Sonate
.

Minimal consolidation steps (no c=
ode moves, just clarity)

Add a footer provenance line
 on yseeku.com:

=E2=80=9CCore trust: SYMBI-Symphony v0.1.0 =E2=80=A2 Product layer: SYMBI-S=
YNERGY (YCQ Sonate).=E2=80=9D Link both.

If you want me to validate any

 repos that the =

nches to check, and I=E2=80=99ll confirm they align with the above mapping.=
