User Account

Service Account

Created for people

Created for applications

Requires login (password, 2FA)

Uses keys for access

Interactive

Non-interactive, automatic

Has a user interface

Works in the background

If you tell me what platform or tool you're seeing 
"service account"
 in, I can give a more tailored explanation.

You said:

when I create the new key in platform.openai it says owned by and has the option service account

ChatGPT said:

Ah, you're encountering the 
new “Service Account” feature on OpenAI's platform
 — part of their recent 
Team and Enterprise features
 that allow for more fine-grained access control and automation.

Let me explain what you're seeing:

🧾 "Owned by" – What It Means in OpenAI

When creating a new API key at 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

, you'll now see an option that says:

"Owned by"

➤ 
[your user]

➤ 
[service account]
 (if you have permission)

This allows you to choose 
who “owns” the key
:

🔹 Option 1: 
Your User (personal key)

Key is tied to your own user identity

Has access 
only to what 
you
 have access to

Ideal for testing, personal scripts, or one-off use

🔹 Option 2: 
Service Account

Key is tied to a non-human “bot” identity

You or your admin set up a 
service account
 with specific roles or scopes

Ideal for 
shared scripts
, 
production apps
, and 
automated tasks

Safer
 for teams: you can rotate keys or revoke access 
without affecting a human user

🧠 Why Use a Service Account in OpenAI?

If you're building something in 
V0.dev
, or deploying an app with 
shared access
, the 
service account key
 is a good option because:

You don’t risk exposing your own personal user key

You can manage its permissions independently

It scales better in a team or production setup

✅ When Should 
You
 Use a Service Account?

Use a 
service account key
 if:

You're building an app for 
production

You're working in a 
team or organization

You want 
audit control
, or plan to rotate the key regularly

Use a 
user-owned key
 if:

You're 
just testing
 or building a quick prototype

You’re working 
solo
 and don’t want to set up a service account yet

💡 Pro Tip

If you're using 
v0.dev
 to call OpenAI's API, either key type will work — just be careful:

Service Account Key
: safer for team/production

User Key
: faster for quick testing

You said:

okay and tell me what is the api key found within the chat interface here?

ChatGPT said:

Great question. Here’s the breakdown:

🔍 API Key in ChatGPT (This Interface)

When you're using ChatGPT here (chat.openai.com), 
you don't need an API key
 yourself to talk to the assistant — it's all handled behind the scenes.

However, if you're referring to the 
"API Key" shown within ChatGPT's "My Tools" or "Settings" interface
, here’s what that really is:

💡 ChatGPT "API Key" — What It Is

When you go to 

https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

, you can 
create a key manually
 to use with:

Custom apps
 (like with 
fetch
, Python, etc.)

Tools like 
Zapier
, 
Bubble
, 
v0.dev
, or any no-code/low-code system

Backend integrations using 
curl
, 
axios
, etc.

The key there is tied to either:

Your user account
, or

A 
service account
, if you're in a team setup

That’s the key you’d 
copy and paste
 into your app or integration. It lets your code access OpenAI models like GPT-4 or GPT-4o.
