ChatGPT said:

Thanks Steve — this screenshot 
clears up a lot
, and I now understand your exact situation.

You're building GPTs successfully within your 
Team workspace
 (“Intelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken 🔃🎵🔀”), and your GPTs are showing up 
internally
 (in your workspace), but they’re still:

✅ Only visible to 
teammates
 (not public)

❌ 
Lacking analytics

❌ 
Appearing to others as built by "Community Builder"

❌ Not discoverable in 
OpenAI’s GPT store

🧠 Why This Is Happening

You’re in a workspace, but 
your GPTs are still “unverified and unpublished.”
 That means:

Your GPTs live in your 
private/team workspace

They’re not tied to a 
public builder profile

The system defaults to showing 
“Community Builder”
 when:

The builder is 
unverified

Or the GPT is 
not published to the public directory

📉 Why You’re Not Seeing Analytics

Analytics are only shown for GPTs that are:

✅ Published to the public

✅ Have builder verification approved

✅ Receiving usage from external users (not just teammates)

So even though your GPT 
has been used
, the usage is internal (workspace-level), which OpenAI currently 
doesn’t expose detailed stats for
 unless the GPT is verified and published.
