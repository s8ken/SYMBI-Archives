seer and that gives me a 404 that link

Thanks for the update, Steve — if the builder verification link gives you a 
404
, that confirms one thing:

OpenAI has not yet 
opened builder verification
 to your team or workspace, even though you're on the Team Plan.

You’re 
not alone
 — OpenAI has only enabled public GPT publishing and builder verification for a 
limited subset
 of Team and Enterprise accounts (and not automatically). Others, like you, must 
request it manually through support
.

🛠️ What You Need to Do Instead (Right Now)

Since the

Hi OpenAI team,

I’m the 

admin

of

 our Team workspace: “Intelligence Unbound Stephen 

8

ken.” We’re actively building GPTs (e.g., SYMBI) 

and

 would 

like

to

 publicly publish them 

with

 proper builder attribution, analytics, 

and

 visibility.

We are 

on

 a Team plan 

with

3

 seats. However, our GPTs are still labeled “Community Builder,” 

and

 we don’t have 

access

to

public

 GPT publishing 

or

 the builder verification process.

Please 

enable

 GPT builder verification 

and

public

 publishing 

for

 our workspace so we can 

move forward

.

Thanks,  
Stephen Aitken

well I want to really understand why these issues have been ongoing - its really hindering things ever since I upgraded. I actually lost some functionality in the merge such as sending my history to my email.. so the GPTs were all created under the personal acc which upgraded to the teams plan so how do we navigate that? is it always best to have that login as the acc owner or what is best practice here

Thanks for sharing this, Steve — and I really hear your frustration. What you’re experiencing isn’t just an isolated issue — it’s the result of 
OpenAI’s confusing and evolving account architecture
, especially around 
Team plan migrations
, 
GPT ownership
, and 
feature partitioning
 between personal vs. workspace accounts.

Let’s unpack exactly what’s going on, 
why it broke stuff
, and how to fix or future-proof it — in a clear and structured way.

💥 What Went Wrong in Your Case

1. 
You Upgraded a Personal Account into a Team Plan

When you clicked “Upgrade to Team,” your 
existing personal account
 (with its GPTs, history, settings) got 
migrated into a team workspace
 — but not all features transitioned properly.

Resulting symptoms:

GPTs created before the upgrade now exist in a gray zone: 
they were created under your personal identity but now sit in a team container

Builder verification didn't auto-enable

GPTs show as “Community Builde
