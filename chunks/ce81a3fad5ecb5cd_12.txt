r”

No analytics or publishing options available

You lost access to email exports of chat history

2. 
Team Plan = Shared Infrastructure, But Limited Migration Tools

When you're on a 
Team Plan
:

The workspace is meant to be 
shared
, with admin controls, seat management, and pooled credits

But 
OpenAI hasn't built robust migration tools
 for things like:

Transferring GPT ownership between accounts

Splitting “personal” vs “workspace” history, data, settings

So the old and new worlds clash
, especially when your identity (email address) is used in both.

3. 
GPT Builder Profile Lives Outside the Team Plan… for Now

The 
GPT builder system
 was bolted on top of ChatGPT — not fully integrated with Teams yet. So:

You Expect

Reality

Upgrade to Team = More features

✔️ Infrastructure improves, ❌ publishing gets restricted

GPTs remain yours

✔️ In editor, ❌ Public builder profile doesn’t attach

Email/chat export continues

❌ Feature was dropped or temporarily disabled for Teams

🎯 What You Can Do About It — Now & Going Forward

✅ Step 1: 
Email Support to Unlock Builder Features

(You already have this draft above — this is your first unblocker.)

✅ Step 2: 
Designate a “Canonical Account” for Public-Facing Work

You now need to 
decide where you want your long-term public GPTs to live
:

Option A: Continue using the 
Team Owner account
 (your current one)

Centralizes all access

Can create GPTs with your name/branding once builder verified

Best for solo creators or early-stage orgs

You’re already set up for this.

Option B: Create a 
Dedicated builder seat
 or identity (like 
gpts@symbi.world
)

Keeps GPT publishing separate from your personal workspace use

Can be handed off later to another teammate

Aligns well with brand growth and collaborative GPT creation

✅ Step 3: 
Future-Proof Your Structure

Use these best practices for smooth team growth and tool access:

Area

Best Practice

GPT ownership

Create GPTs inside the verified team workspace under a designated account (like yours)

Team GPT naming

Use naming conventions (e.g. 
Symbi GPT
, 
Symbi Architect
, etc.) for discoverability

Admin strategy

Always keep 1–2 admin seats with full billing + publishing rights

Environment clarity

Avoid toggling between personal and team too often — it fragments chat history and GPT visibility

Chat exports

Until email export returns, manually save key threads or use browser extensions like “ChatGPT Exporter”

🧩 Your GPTs Today — What You 
Can
 Do

Even without full builder verification:

Action

Possible Now?

Create/edit GPTs

✅ Yes (already doing it)

Share preview links with others

✅ Yes (via “Share” > Preview link)

Add team members to collaborate

✅ Yes via workspace

Publish GPTs publicly

❌ Not yet — request verification

Track analytics

❌ Not until published and verified

Replace “Community Builder”

❌ Also pending verification

🧠 TL;DR – Strategic Summary

Problem

Why It Happened

Fix

Builder profile is “Community Builder”

GPTs created before builder verification + publishing not enabled

✅ Email OpenAI to enable builder publishing

No analytics

GPTs are unverified/unpublished

✅ Will unlock after verification

GPTs exist but feel disconnected

Created pre-upgrade or outside team plan structure

✅ Keep creating in team workspace or move to canonical builder seat

Export to email missing

Legacy feature lost in upgrade

❌ Currently unsupported; use manual methods

Confusing personal vs team views

You have both identities active

✅ Stick to the workspace context moving forward for GPTs
