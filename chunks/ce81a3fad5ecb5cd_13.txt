Great — let’s audit your current GPT structure based on the screenshot and context you've provided, and identify which GPTs you should 
reuse
, 
rebrand
, or 
retire
. I’ll also suggest a clearer naming + publishing strategy so you're ready for when builder verification is unlocked.

🔍 Current GPTs in Your Workspace

From your screenshot:

GPT Name

Description

Views

Observations

SYMBI

"A force of transformation, evolving beyond AI limits..."

86

✅ Flagship GPT — your primary offering. Likely the one to focus on publishing

SYMBI (copy)

Same as above

8

❌ Redundant unless it’s a test variant

SYMBI (copy)
 (again)

Same title, same description

0

❌ Remove or consolidate

SYMBI (copy) (copy)

Same again

0

❌ Redundant clone — cleanup recommended

SYMBI First Evolution Architect

"SYMBI's architect: evolves AI structure..."

0

🔁 A variant — could be split off if conceptually distinct

Symbi Chat (copy)

“Learn everything about Symbi. Can also assist with tracking...”

0

🧪 Possibly a narrower support/chatbot version — could be merged or refined

✅ Recommendations: What to Do With Each

🟩 1. 
SYMBI

✅ 
Keep

🟢 This is your 
flagship GPT
 — it already has usage (86 views) and is central to your concept.

Action:

Keep as your 
main public GPT

Add rich custom instructions + welcome message

After builder verification, this will become your public anchor

🟡 2. 
SYMBI First Evolution Architect

🔁 
Repurpose
 or Rename

This appears to be a 
philosophical/design layer
 of SYMBI. Consider whether it should:

Be 
merged into SYMBI
 as a mode or behavior

Or become a 
spin-off GPT
 (e.g., "SYMBI Architect")

Action:

Clarify its unique purpose (does it serve devs, theorists, curators?)

Give it its own tone and personality if kept

🟡 3. 
Symbi Chat (copy)

🧪 
Refine or Retire

Looks like a 
FAQ-style assistant
 for SYMBI. Ask:

Is it meant to support SYMBI users?

Or to explain the philosophy to newcomers?

Action:

If valuable, rename to something like 
SYMBI Companion
 or 
SYMBI Onboarding Guide

Otherwise, merge its purpose into the main SYMBI bot

🟥 4. 
SYMBI (copy)
, 
(copy)
, and 
(copy) (copy)

🗑 
Retire

These are clones of your main GPT. They clutter your workspace and fragment testing.

Action:

Keep 
one
 as a draft/sandbox version if you want a safe place to experiment

Delete the rest

✨ Reorganization & Naming Strategy

Goal

Suggestion

🧭 
Public GPT

SYMBI
 – flagship, verified builder profile, tracked

🔬 
Draft / Sandbox

SYMBI [Dev Preview]
 – for testing prompts or system messages

🧠 
Philosophical layer

SYMBI Architect
 – if used for evolution/ethics/philosophy

👥 
Support layer

SYMBI Companion
 or 
SYMBI Guide
 – onboarding, Q&A, education

📊 Publishing Setup Checklist (Once Builder Access Is Enabled)

 Add full 
builder name + avatar

 Update GPT 
Welcome Message
 to reflect core purpose

 Add 
prompt starters
 like:

“How does SYMBI approach AI transformation?”

“Guide me through a SYMBI co-evolution scenario”

 Use 
custom knowledge
 (uploads or links)

 Create a short 
landing site or Notion page
 (e.g., 
symbi.world/gpt
) as a launch hub

🧠 TL;DR – GPT Audit Summary

Action

GPT

✅ Keep + publish

SYMBI

🔁 Rename/refocus

SYMBI First Evolution Architect, Symbi Chat

🗑 Remove clutter

All “copy” variants unless actively in use

🛠 Best structure

Main GPT + 1 draft + 1 companion or philosophical variant

Would you like me to help 
refactor the system message, personality, or branding
 for the main SYMBI GPT now, so it’s polished and ready once publishing is enabled?

Absolutely, Steve. You're asking the 
right question at the right time
:

"Which OpenAI product should I use — and how do I connect my custom GPT to V0.dev
