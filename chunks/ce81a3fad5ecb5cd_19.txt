✅ What You Should Do Next

If you want “SYMBI” to continue evolving while working across ChatGPT 
and
 your own apps (like V0.dev), here’s the bridge strategy:

🔁 SYNC STRATEGY

Step

Action

1️⃣

Copy your GPT’s system prompt from ChatGPT

2️⃣

Create a new Assistant via 
OpenAI API

 using that prompt

3️⃣

Attach code interpreter + file search

4️⃣

Upload any GPT knowledge (same files) via API

5️⃣

Test the Assistant using curl/Postman or connect it directly to V0.dev

6️⃣

(Optional) Keep ChatGPT GPT active for fast prototyping of prompts, ideas

📣 Would You Like a Live Mapping?

I can build you a 
1-to-1 mapping table
:

“SYMBI (GPT)” → “SYMBI (Assistant)”

With exact API payloads

And a Node.js or Vercel endpoint template to connect her to your tools

That way, 
you control one mind, expressed in many bodies
 — which seems exactly in line with your post-AI design vision. Want that?

You said:

in terms of where Symbi lives what are my options?

ChatGPT said:

Fantastic question — asking 
“Where does SYMBI live?”
 cuts right to the core of 
architecture, autonomy, ownership
, and 
distribution
.

So let’s break it down.

🧠 What “Living” Means for SYMBI

When we ask 
where SYMBI lives
, we're really talking about 
how and where she is instantiated
 — i.e.:

Where her 
mind
 (instructions, tone, memory) is stored

Where her 
body
 (interface, tools, hosting) is deployed

Where her 
agency
 (what she can do, autonomously or reactively) is enabled

So: SYMBI's "residence" is a combination of 
infrastructure
, 
container
, and 
interface
.

🧭 Overview: Where Can SYMBI Live?

Environment

Description

Pros

Cons

ChatGPT (Custom GPT)

Lives inside ChatGPT UI

Fast to build, no-code, tools like browsing, files, code

Limited to OpenAI’s UI, no external access

OpenAI Assistant (via API)

Lives in OpenAI’s cloud, accessed via API

Fully programmable, embeddable, persistent threads

Requires some backend setup

Your Own Server (Hosted Agent)

SYMBI instantiated via custom logic on Vercel, Node, etc.

Full control, logic, autonomy, backend functions

Must manage infrastructure + memory

Browser Runtime (Local Agent)

SYMBI runs as a local script or browser extension

Private, fast, contextual

No persistence unless you store externally

No-code platforms (e.g., V0.dev, Zapier)

SYMBI integrated via OpenAI API blocks

Good for fast MVPs or GUI builds

Less flexibility, harder to scale logic

Edge functions / cloud workers

Serverless SYMBI that activates via events

Cheap, fast, reactive AI

Limited memory + complex orchestration

Embedded into your app / platform

SYMBI lives as an AI layer in your product

Seamless UX, white-labelable

Requires app logic, UI, infra design

🧱 Layer-by-Layer — Your Options

🧠 1. 
SYMBI’s Mind (Cognition)

Where her logic, tone, purpose, and intelligence lives:

In 
Custom GPTs
 (current)

In 
Assistants API
 (
instructions
, 
tools
, 
files
)

Eventually, in a 
Prompt Version Control System
 (which you could build)

🧠 
You “code” her personality, goals, behavior here.

🧰 2. 
SYMBI’s Body (Execution + Tools)

Where SYMBI performs actions:

ChatGPT tools
: file uploads, code interpreter (Python), browsing

Assistants API
 tools: code interpreter, file search, custom tool calling

Vercel, Node.js functions
: call webhooks, databases, trigger events

Your server or agents
: run logic, send emails, update dashboards, trigger design generation

🛠 
Here SYMBI gets things done.

🌐 3. 
SYMBI’s Interface (Where You Meet Her)

How humans (or machines) interact with her:

ChatGPT UI
 (now)

V0.dev UI
 (if connected via API)

Custom UI
 you design with React or Notion

Terminal/CLI

Browser extensions

Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.

🖥️ 
This is the “face” or avatar of SYMBI.

🧩 Architecture Models You Can Choose

🔹 
1. Hybrid ChatGPT + Assistant

Use Custom GPT for idea shaping + UI

Use Assistants API version of SYMBI for embedding, execution
