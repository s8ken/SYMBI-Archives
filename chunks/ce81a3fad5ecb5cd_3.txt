Or — if you’re staying low-code (e.g. V0.dev, Zapier), I can guide you on how to wrap your key with a secure webhook proxy.

how do I revoke

ChatGPT said:

To 
revoke
 (i.e., delete or disable) an 
OpenAI API key
, you just need to go into your API dashboard and delete the key. Here's a simple step-by-step:

🔥 How to Revoke an OpenAI API Key

Go to the API Keys page

➤ 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Find the key you want to revoke

Keys are listed under 
“API Keys”

You’ll see their 
name
, 
created date
, and 
owner
 (your user or a service account)

Click the trash icon 🗑
 next to the key

A confirmation will pop up

Once confirmed, the key is permanently 
revoked
 and 
cannot be used anymore

🧼 After Revoking

If the key is used in 
deployed apps
, they’ll stop working unless you replace it

Rotate it: create a new key and update your 
env vars
 or 
app settings

You can also set up 
different keys for staging/production
 for better separation and revocation control

🧠 Bonus: What Happens After Revocation?

Action

Result

Someone tries to use the key

API request fails with 
401 Unauthorized

Your billing or usage

Stops counting usage from the deleted key

Your apps or integrations

Will break until a new valid key is provided

If you want help rotating the key in a V0, Vercel, or backend setup, I can guide you step-by-step.

You said:

I just gave Vercel a service key but I don't see completions and chat as options to enable

ChatGPT said:

Got it — you're giving 
Vercel
 an 
OpenAI service account key
, likely to use GPT models like 
gpt-4
 or 
gpt-4o
, but you're not seeing 
"completions"
 or 
"chat"
 options to enable. Let’s clear up what’s going on and what you need to check.

🧭 What You’re Likely Expecting

When integrating OpenAI with Vercel (especially using tools like V0.dev or your own custom app), you're probably expecting to:

Call 
https://api.openai.com/v1/completions
 or 
/v1/chat/completions

Use the key to power a chatbot, summarizer, or other AI flow

Possibly configure permissions for which models or endpoints are allowed

🤖 Why You're Not Seeing “Completions” or “Chat” as Options

1. 
No Toggle for Endpoints

OpenAI 
doesn’t
 provide toggles or granular permission controls (yet) like:

✅ Enable 
chat

❌ Disable 
images

There’s no user interface for this. Once a key is created, it 
has full access
 to all model endpoints your account is allowed to use (based on your plan or org settings).

✅ What to Do Instead

🧪 Step-by-step: Test the Key Works

Open a terminal or use Postman

Try calling the API directly:

bash

Copy

Edit

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY"

 \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -d 
'{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'

If it responds, your key 
does
 support 
chat
.

🔍 Things to Check

1. 
Service Account Access

Go to 
https://platform.openai.com/account/service-accounts

Click on the service account you used

Make sure:

It’s 
active

You gave it 
project access

The 
API key is from this service account

2. 
Correct Key Is Being Used

In Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables

Ensure the key is 
the full service account key
 (starts with 
sk-
)

Make sure it’s used in 
backend code only
, not exposed in frontend files

🔄 If Using V0.dev with Vercel

You paste the API key inside the action or logic block that connects to OpenAI

There’s 
no need to “enable chat/completions” explicitly

Just paste a valid key and call the endpoint:

For chat: 
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

For classic completions: 
https://api.openai.com/v1/completions
