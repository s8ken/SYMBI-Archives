🧠 TL;DR

There’s no UI option to “enable” completions or chat — your key has access by default

If you’re not seeing expected behavior:

Test the key with 
curl
 or Postman

Ensure the key is from a service account with valid project access

Use it only in backend code (especially on Vercel)

If you share how you're trying to use it in Vercel or V0 (e.g., a fetch block, API route, etc.), I can give you a snippet or fix any errors you're running into.

I get page not found

Thanks for the follow-up. If you're getting a 
"Page Not Found"
 error when trying to use the OpenAI API (especially the 
chat/completions
 endpoint), that usually means the 
URL is incorrect
, or there's a 
misconfigured request
.

Let’s walk through a full diagnostic and fix.

✅ Correct API Endpoint for Chat Completions

The 
chat endpoint
 must be:

bash

Copy

Edit

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Make sure:

It starts with 
https://
 (not 
http://
)

Includes 
/v1/chat/completions
 (not just 
/chat
, 
/completions
, etc.)

🧪 Quick Curl Test

Here’s a full working 
curl
 example. Run this in 
Terminal
 (Mac/Linux) or 
Git Bash
 (Windows):

bash

Copy

Edit

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

 \
  -H 

"Content-Type: application/json"

 \
  -d 
'{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'

Replace:

sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 with your 
actual
 API key

If it returns JSON with a response, it’s working.

🛠 Common Causes of "Page Not Found"

Error

Explanation

Fix

404 Page Not Found

The endpoint URL is wrong

Use the exact URL: 
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Typo in the path

e.g., 
/v1/chats
 or 
/v1/chat

Correct to 
/v1/chat/completions

Wrong domain

e.g., 
openai.com/api/...

Must be 
api.openai.com

Fetching from frontend

Could be blocked or hidden error

Use backend or proxy to test first

🧩 If Using 
fetch()
 or V0.dev

If you're calling it in code (like 
fetch()
 or in a V0.dev block), make sure your code looks like this:

js

Copy

Edit

await

fetch

(

"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

, {

method

: 

"POST"

,

headers

: {

"Authorization"

: 

`Bearer 
${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}

`,

"Content-Type"

: 

"application/json"

,
  },

body

: 

JSON

.

stringify

({

model

: 

"gpt-4o"

,

messages

: [
      { 

role

: 

"user"

, 

content

: 

"Say hi"

 }
    ]
  }),
});

Note:
 In V0.dev, paste the full endpoint URL and key into the action setup.

✅ Checklist to Fix

✅ Use this 
exact endpoint
:

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

✅ Confirm the key starts with 
sk-
 and is not expired or revoked

✅ Test with 
curl
 or Postman to verify it's not a Vercel/V0 issue

✅ Use backend to call OpenAI API, not frontend browser directly (or it will expose the key)

Would you like to paste your code or setup here (redact the key), and I’ll check it line-by-line for issues?

Ah, you're getting 
“Page Not Found”
 while using a 
service account key
 from OpenAI — and you're likely calling something like:

bash

Copy

Edit

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Let’s break this down, because 
service accounts use a different endpoint and authentication flow
 from regular 
sk-
 keys.

🔐 Service Account Keys Work Differently

When you use a 
Service Account key
 in OpenAI, the key is 
not
 a direct-use 
sk-
 string.

Instead, it’s a 
JSON key file
 that includes:

client_email

private_key

project_id

And more...

You cannot use this key directly with curl or fetch.

You must first exchange it for an 
access token
 using 
OAuth 2.0 JWT flow
. Then you use 
that token
 in the 
Authorization
 header.
