Create a 
JWT (JSON Web Token)
 signed with your service account's private key

Exchange it for an access token via:

bash

Copy

Edit

POST https://auth.openai.com/oauth2/token

With this payload:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"grant_type"

:

"urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer"

,

"assertion"

:

"<your-signed-jwt>"

}

(You can do this in Node.js, Python, or with Google’s 
google-auth-library
.)

⚙️ 2. Use the Access Token

Once you have the token, then you call:

bash

Copy

Edit

https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

With:

http

Copy

Edit

Authorization: Bearer <access-token>

✅ Now your request will work!

⚠️ Why You're Seeing “Page Not Found”

You likely tried to call the OpenAI API with the raw 
service account key
 like this:

bash

Copy

Edit

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 

"Authorization: Bearer <service-account-private-key>"

 \
  ...

This 
doesn’t work
, and OpenAI will return 
404
 or 
401
.

🛠 Want a Working Code Sample?

I can generate a 
Node.js
 or 
Python
 snippet that:

Loads the service account JSON

Exchanges it for an access token

Calls the 
chat/completions
 endpoint securely

Just let me know which language you prefer.

✅ TL;DR

You Tried

What Went Wrong

How to Fix

Called OpenAI API with service key directly

❌ Service account keys aren’t direct-use 
sk-
 keys

Use 
OAuth 2.0 JWT flow
 to get an access token

Got 404 or 401

Invalid or unrecognized bearer

Follow correct token exchange flow first

Expected chat/completion toggle

Doesn’t exist — access is controlled by scopes in the JWT

Let me know your language stack (Node.js, Python, Vercel backend, etc.) and I’ll give you a working snippet.

okay this is my first time using the https://api.openai.com site at all and im new to this and not too familiar with code

Thanks for sharing that, Steve — that helps a 
lot
. Since this is your first time using the 
OpenAI API platform

 and you're not super familiar with code, let's take it 
step-by-step
 in a 
low-code / beginner-friendly
 way.

We'll walk through 
exactly how to use your service account key properly
 — without getting lost in developer jargon.

🧠 First, Quick Recap of Where You're At

You've:

✅ Signed up on 
platform.openai.com

✅ Created a 
Service Account

✅ Downloaded a 
JSON key file

✅ Gave that file to Vercel or something else

🚫 But when you try to call the API (like 
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
) it says 
Page Not Found

🚧 Why It’s Not Working

The problem is: 
Service Account keys are 
not
 “plug and play” like regular API keys
.

They are like ID badges — you need to 
use them to request a temporary access pass
, called an 
Access Token
, before you can talk to the OpenAI API.

✅ The Beginner-Friendly Way to Fix It

Since you’re using 
Vercel
, and possibly 
V0.dev
 or a no-code tool, you have two beginner-friendly options:

🔹 
Option 1: Skip the Service Account — Use a Regular API Key Instead

This is 
best for solo builders
 or beginners.

Go to: 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Click 
"Create new secret key"

Copy the 
sk-xxxxxxxx...
 key

Paste it into your Vercel environment, V0.dev, or any API setup

In Vercel: Project → Settings → Environment Variables → 
OPENAI_API_KEY

✅ This key 
works immediately
 with the 
/v1/chat/completions
 endpoint

🚫 Don’t put it directly into frontend files — always use it in backend or secure environments

🔒 It’s just like a password — keep it private

🔹 
Option 2: Stick With the Service Account (Advanced)

If you 
really
 want to use the Service Account securely (for team apps or production):

You’ll need to:

Use code to 
sign the key
 (JWT)

Exchange it for a 
temporary token

Call the API with that token

But since you said you're new to code, 
I recommend Option 1 for now
 — it'll save you hours of complexity.
