Contact your workspace administrator to set up a builder profile"

This means:

You're likely using ChatGPT under a 
Team or Enterprise workspace
 (like 
symbi.world
)

To make your GPT 
publicly discoverable
, the workspace 
admin
 must verify you

Until that happens, your GPTs can be used in 
preview mode
, but not 
shared with everyone

✅ What You Can Do Next

🟢 To Replace “PlaceholderGPT” with Your Own Info:

Click 
your name ("Steve")

Add your:

Website

LinkedIn, GitHub, X links

Set your 
profile picture
 (once verification is enabled)

🟡 To Publish GPTs Publicly:

Ask your 
workspace admin
 to:

Verify your builder profile from the admin panel

Approve your ability to publish to the public directory

After that, your GPTs can appear on:

https://chat.openai.com/gpts

Searchable by anyone

You said:

I am the admin on the team account 

ChatGPT said:

Perfect, Steve — since 
you’re the admin on the team account
, that means 
you have full control
 to verify your GPT builder profile and unlock public publishing.

Here’s how to go from 
“PlaceholderGPT”
 to a full public GPT profile, step by step:

✅ Step-by-Step: Enable GPT Publishing for Yourself (as Admin)

🧭 1. Go to Your Admin Console

Visit: 
https://platform.openai.com

Click your 
organization name
 (e.g., 
symbi.world
) in the top-left dropdown

Go to 
Settings
 → 
Team Settings
 (or 
Workspace settings
)

🔐 2. Enable Builder Verification & Publishing

In your 
admin settings
, look for:

Builder Verification
 or 
GPT Publishing Permissions

Do the following:

✅ 
Verify your own builder identity
 (you may need to confirm your email/domain)

✅ 
Enable public GPT publishing
 for yourself and/or other members

If you see any of these toggles, make sure they are:

✔️ Allow GPTs to be shared publicly

✔️ Verified builder profile for [your name/email]

🧩 3. Return to ChatGPT and Refresh

Go back to 
https://chat.openai.com

:

Visit Settings → Account → GPT Builder Profile

You should now be able to:

Change your name and avatar

Add links

Publish GPTs 
publicly
, not just in preview mode

You’ll no longer see 
“PlaceholderGPT”
 — it will be replaced by the profile you configure.

Thanks Steve — I see the confusion now from your screenshot.
