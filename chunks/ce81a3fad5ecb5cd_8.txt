No signs of organization/team settings

No admin panel, team management, or verification tools

So what’s happening?

You're likely:

Still using a 
personal OpenAI account
 (not yet upgraded to a 
Team
 workspace)

Or the 
team workspace hasn't been verified
 for GPT publishing features

✅ Here’s How to Set Up Admin Access (Properly)

🟢 Step 1: Check If You're on a Team Plan

Go to: 
https://chat.openai.com/settings/team

If you see an option to "Create Team" or "Upgrade to Team," then you're 
not yet in a team workspace
.

Otherwise, you'll see a list of members, and you can manage roles (including making yourself an admin).

🟡 Step 2: If Needed, Create a Team Workspace

Go to: 
https://chat.openai.com

Click your name/email → “
Settings
”

Go to 
Team
 or 
Plan

Select 
“Upgrade to Team”
 (free trial or paid plan)

Add your domain (
symbi.world
) to enable GPT builder verification later

🔐 Step 3: Set Yourself as Workspace Admin

Once your team is created:

You’ll automatically be the 
admin

Now, return to the 
GPT builder profile
 in ChatGPT

You’ll be able to toggle the 
verification and public GPT publishing
 options

🧩 Why This Matters for PlaceholderGPT

You’re seeing 
“PlaceholderGPT”
 and the 
“Contact your administrator”
 warning because:

Your account isn’t tied to a 
verified team workspace

Or that workspace hasn't been configured for 
GPT builder verification

Even if you're the only one on the team, OpenAI still needs the 
workspace structure
 in place

✅ TL;DR – Fix Checklist

Step

Action

✅ Check if you're in a Team workspace

chat.openai.com/settings/team

🆕 If not, create one

Upgrade to Team plan (can be free trial)

👤 Become the admin

You will be by default if you create it

🔓 Enable public GPT publishing

Then edit your GPT Builder profile and remove the “PlaceholderGPT” warning

You said:

I got a 404

ChatGPT said:

Got it — if you got a 
404
 when trying to access:

👉 
https://chat.openai.com/settings/team

That means your account is currently 
not enrolled in a Team or Enterprise plan
. You're still on a 
free or individual Plus plan
, so the 
workspace features (like team admin, builder verification, and org publishing)
 aren’t available yet.

🧱 Why You’re Getting 404

The 
/settings/team
 page only exists for accounts that are part of:

A 
ChatGPT Team Plan

Or a 
ChatGPT Enterprise workspace

Since you’re getting a 404, your account:

Is personal (even if you’re using a domain like 
symbi.world
)

Doesn’t have access to team admin functions, verification toggles, or org-wide GPT publishing

✅ What You Can Do Next

🟢 Option 1: 
Upgrade to a Team Plan

To unlock:

Verified GPT builder profile

Admin tools

GPT sharing under your org name

Role-based access (for collaborators later)

Here’s how:

Go to: 
https://chat.openai.com

Click your name/profile photo → 
Settings

Under 
Plan
, click “
Upgrade to Team
”

(You'll get a 
free trial
, no card required upfront)

Once upgraded:

The 
team admin panel
 will appear

You’ll become the 
admin

You can enable GPT 
verification + public publishing

🔒 Option 2: Stay on Personal Plan — Use Preview Links Only

If you don't want to upgrade right now:

You can still 
create and share GPTs privately

But they’ll only show as 
“Preview”
, and people will need the direct link

You won’t be able to change the “PlaceholderGPT” name until you verify under a team
