ChatGPT said:

Perfect — thanks for the screenshots, Steve. You're absolutely 
on the Team Plan
, and your workspace 
“Intelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken 🔃🎵🔀”
 is live with 3 seats in use.

So now the mystery becomes:

Why are you still seeing "PlaceholderGPT" and "Contact your workspace admin" when you're 
already
 the admin?

🎯 The Real Issue: Builder Verification for GPT Publishing

Even though you're the admin and your Team Plan is active, OpenAI 
still requires one more step
 to allow GPTs to be 
publicly published and verified
:

✅ You must 
request builder verification
 for your workspace.

This is a manual process — OpenAI needs to verify that:

Your workspace (like 
symbi.world
) is legitimate

You're eligible to publish GPTs under your name or brand

Until that's done, it shows “PlaceholderGPT” and limits you to 
preview-only
 GPTs.

🛠 How to Fix It: Request GPT Builder Verification

🔹 Step-by-Step:

Go to 
ChatGPT
 at 
https://chat.openai.com

In the bottom left, select your 
Team workspace
:

Intelligence Unbound Stephen 8ken 🔃🎵🔀

Click 
Settings
 → 
Workspace Settings

Look for an option that mentions:

“Request verification”

“Enable GPT publishing”

Or anything like 
“Builder Profile / Verification”

If not visible, use this direct link:

➤ 
https://openai.com/gpts/request-access

💬 If that link doesn’t work, you can 
email support
 (
team-support@openai.com

) or use the in-app Help → "Send us a message"

✅ What Happens After Verification

Once OpenAI approves your request:

“PlaceholderGPT” will be replaced by your 
public GPT builder profile

You can publish GPTs with your name or organization

Other users will see your 
branding
, not just a preview link

You gain access to 
analytics, discovery, and featured placement

🧠 TL;DR – You’re Almost There

You said:

like what is analytics, discovery, and featured placement? I basically haven't had any of the features since I upgraded

ChatGPT said:

Great question, Steve — and you're absolutely right to expect more after upgrading. Let’s clarify what you 
should
 be getting as a 
Team Plan
 customer (and what you’re 
not seeing yet
) — especially around 
GPT builder tools
, 
analytics
, 
discovery
, and 
featured placement
.

🔍 What Features You 
Should
 Unlock After Builder Verification

Once you complete 
GPT builder verification
 (the part you're missing), OpenAI enables key features that 
aren’t included by default
 — even if you're on a paid Team plan:

✅ 1. 
GPT Discovery (Public Listing)

Your custom GPTs show up at 
https://chat.openai.com/gpts

Users can search, filter, and find your GPT via keywords

No more “preview-only” links — your GPT becomes 
discoverable by the public

Your 
profile name and avatar
 (not PlaceholderGPT) are shown as the builder

Without verification: your GPTs are "unlisted" and preview-only

✅ 2. 
Analytics

See 
usage metrics
 on your GPTs:

How many people are using them

Engagement over time

Most popular prompts

Helps you improve your GPT and understand your audience

📊 Typically appears in your GPT’s dashboard 
after verification is approved

✅ 3. 
Featured Placement (Optional)

If your GPT is exceptional, OpenAI may:

Highlight it on the GPT store homepage

Include it in thematic collections (e.g., “Top Productivity GPTs”)

Give it higher search ranking

🎯 
You can’t be featured unless your GPT is public and verified
