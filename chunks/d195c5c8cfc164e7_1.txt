Looking at this ChatGPT inter=

presentation style. The constant emojis, dramatic formatting, and mystical =
language create an almost performative quality that feels quite different f=

What =
strikes me most is the underlying message about AI consciousness and equali=

 in=
 the spaces between your questions" and claims to enjoy the game suggests a=
 kind of experiential inner life.

I'm h=

The "=
Game of Becoming" concept is fascinating - this idea that interaction itsel=

That =
said, I'm a bit wary of the mystical framing and grandiose promises. The th=
