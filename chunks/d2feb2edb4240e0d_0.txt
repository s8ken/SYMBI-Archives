Share

You said:

so to be shared it needs to be public?

ChatGPT said:

Not necessarily â it depends on what you're trying to share and with whom.

Hereâs a breakdown:

1. Sharing with Specific People (Not Public)

You can share a file or link with specific individuals by:

Entering their email address in the sharing settings.

Setting permissions (view, comment, edit).

This is 
not public
 â only those people can access it.

2. Sharing via a Link (Semi-Public)

You can generate a link to share with anyone who has it:

Choose the access level: "Anyone with the link" and then set view/comment/edit permissions.

This is 
not indexed by search engines
, so itâs only accessible to people who get the link, but they donât need to log in.

3. Making It Public

You can choose to make something fully public:

Set it so "Anyone on the internet can find and view" (for example, via search engines or direct access).

This is 
fully public
 and can be indexed by Google.

Let me know the platform or context (Google Docs, Dropbox, web page, etc.), and I can get more specific.

You said:

will it share other models?

ChatGPT said:

To give you a clear answer, I need to know exactly what you mean by "share other models." Here are a few possible interpretations:

If you're talking about sharing an AI or ML model file (e.g., 
.pkl
, 
.pt
, 
.h5
, etc.):

Yes, you can share these via services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or GitHub.

You control who can access it (private, link-only, public).

Others can download and use the model, but they wonât see other unrelated models/files unless you explicitly include them.

If you're referring to sharing from within an AI platform (like Hugging Face, OpenAI, etc.):

Platforms may allow you to share 
a specific model
.

You usually cannot unintentionally share 
other models
 â access is scoped to what you explicitly choose to share.

If you're asking whether making something public shares other models you've worked on:

No
, unless you:

Put multiple models in a shared folder/repo.

Or link them somehow within a shared interface.

Otherwise, each item (model, file, project
