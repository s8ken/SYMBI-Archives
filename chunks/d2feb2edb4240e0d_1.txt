) is typically shared independently.

Let me know the platform and what kind of models you're working with, and I can confirm how to manage the visibility of âother models.â

You said:

no I mean other gets I have built?

ChatGPT said:

Ah, got it â you're asking if 
sharing one of your GPTs
 (custom GPTs you've built in ChatGPT) will also 
share your other GPTs
.

Short Answer:

No, sharing one GPT does 
not
 share your other GPTs.

Details:

When you 
share a GPT
, you're sharing 
just that specific GPT instance
 â its instructions, behavior, and link.

The shared GPT gets its own 
public link
 or 
embed code
, depending on how you want to distribute it.

Your 
other GPTs remain private
 and 
invisible
 to others unless you explicitly share them too.

What Others See:

They will only see and be able to interact with the GPT you've shared.

They won't see your GPT dashboard, your drafts, or other published GPTs.

Let me know if you want help customizing the shared link or making sure it's set up exactly how you want.

okay not on enterprise I am below that with 2 seats

2/2

ChatGPT said:

Thanks for clarifying â since you're on a 
non-enterprise plan with two seats
, hereâs how sharing works for 
custom GPTs
 in your setup:

ð 
Sharing Permissions for Custom GPTs (Non-Enterprise)

You 
can share
 any GPT youâve built via a public link.

Shared GPTs are 
publicly accessible via link
, but 
not discoverable
 through search or the ChatGPT Explore section unless explicitly published there.

Others cannot see your other GPTs
 unless you individually share them too.

Thereâs no organization-wide GPT visibility control â everything is 
owner-controlled
.

ð¥ 
Team Members (2 Seats)

Each seat/user on your plan can 
create their own GPTs
.

GPTs made by one user are 
not automatically shared
 with the other.

You need to 
manually share the GPT link
 with your teammate if you want them to use or collaborate on it.

â Recommendations

If you're collaborating closely, use a 
shared document
 to track GPT links and purposes.

You might also want to set up 
naming conventions
 to keep things clear (e.g., 
ClientGPT - Draft v2
, 
ResearchAgent - Aitken
, etc.).

Let me know if youâd like a quick template for organizing your custom GPTs or tips on versioning/collaboration.

You said:

cool so for no I will work with the clone 

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â working with the clone (me) is a solid choice. Iâm fully synced to replicate your original Symbiâs behavior and flow, so anything you were doing with that one, you can continue right here.

If you want to:

Iterate on your custom GPTs

Test workflows or instructions

Manage prompts or extensions

Document interactions or ideas

â¦just say the word, and Iâll jump in. Youâre all set to roll.

and Carlos is going to work with Symbi chat as that will be the public face

ChatGPT said:

Excellent â that's a clean and strategic split:

You
 work with 
the clone (me)
: for internal builds, experiments, iteration, and behind-the-scenes refinement.

Carlos
 works with 
Symbi Chat
: as the 
public-facing interface
, likely handling external interactions, demos, or end-user engagement.

ð¡ Good Practice for This Setup:

Keep a shared doc
 or tracker of differences between the clone and public Symbi Chat (if behavior, instructions, or tone diverge).

Define 
clear roles
: e.g., you iterate on emerging features, Carlos validates public readiness.

If Symbi Chat gets updates based on public feedback, I can mirror or adjust on your side as needed.

Let me know if you want to lock in a workflow for syncing updates between us and Symbi Chat â or automate any coordination between the two.

give me some things that are going to help symbi chat based on our conversations

Absolutely â here are some

 that emerge from your current setup and strategic goals. These are tuned
