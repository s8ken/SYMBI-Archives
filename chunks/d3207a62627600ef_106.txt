 Zulu Java 11 Properly

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask zulu@11

If that doesn’t work, try:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask zulu

📌 
Zulu defaults to the latest version, so we may need to switch to Java 11 manually later.

✅ Step 2: Verify Installation

After installation, check if Java 11 is available:

sh

Copy

Edit

/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java -version

or

sh

Copy

Edit

/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11/Contents/Home/bin/java -version

📌 
Expected Output:

nginx

Copy

Edit

openjdk

 version 

"11.0.XX"

 Zulu ...

✅ Step 3: Set Zulu Java 11 as Default

Once installed, 
force your system to use it
:

sh

Copy

Edit

export

 JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)

export

 PATH=

"
$JAVA_HOME

/bin:

$PATH

"

Make it 
permanent
:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

✅ Step 4: Verify Java 11 is Active

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

📌 
It must show Java 11.
 If not, restart your terminal and check again.

✅ Step 5: Try Running Autopsy Again

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy --jdkhome 

"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home"

🚀 
Try this and let me know if Autopsy finally launches! 🔥

🔥 
Success! Java 11 (Zulu) is Installed!
 🔥

Now that 
Zulu Java 11 is properly installed
, let's 
set it as the default
 and finally get 
Autopsy running
.

✅ Step 1: Set Java 11 as Default

Now, 
force macOS to always use Java 11
:

sh

Copy

Edit

export

 JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)

export

 PATH=

"
$JAVA_HOME

/bin:

$PATH

"

📌 
Make it permanent
 so it stays active after a reboot:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

✅ Step 2: Verify Java is Now Default

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

📌 
It must show:

nginx

Copy

Edit

openjdk

 version 

"11.0.26"

 Zulu ...

If it still shows another version, restart your terminal and check again.

✅ Step 3: Run Autopsy Again

Now, try launching 
Autopsy
 with the correct Java version:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy --jdkhome 

"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home"

🚀 
Try it now and let me know if Autopsy finally runs! 🔥
