rSight:

Open 
OverSight
 from Applications.

Enable monitoring
 for your camera and microphone.

It will pop up an alert
 when an unknown app tries to access them.

5️⃣ 
FSMonitor

 (Monitor File System Changes in Real-Time)

📂 
FSMonitor
 shows all file system activity 
in real-time
—helpful for detecting if spyware is secretly modifying files, installing backdoors, or changing system permissions.

Install it via Homebrew:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install --cask fsmonitor

Run FSMonitor:

Open FSMonitor.

Watch for unusual file changes
, such as:

Hidden installs (
/Library/LaunchDaemons/
)

Secret logs (
/var/log/
)

Screen recordings (
/tmp/
)

🔍 How to Check for Remote Management & Surveillance

After installing these tools, run the following 
manual checks
 in 
Terminal
 to spot hidden spyware:

1️⃣ Check for Remote Management

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin

👉 If it says 
"Remote Login: On"
, someone may have 
SSH access
 to your Mac.

To disable:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

2️⃣ List Running Screen Capture & Camera Processes

Check for 
active screen recording
 processes:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i 

"screen"

👉 If you see suspicious processes like 
screensharingd
, 
investigate further
.

Check for 
apps using the camera
:

sh

Copy

Edit

lsof | grep 

"VDC"

👉 This will show any process accessing your 
Mac's camera
.

3️⃣ List All Startup Services

sh

Copy

Edit

launchctl list

👉 This shows all 
background services
 running at startup—use it to spot anything unusual.

4️⃣ Detect Hidden Remote Access Software

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

👉 This will show 
open network connections
. If you see unknown services listening on 
ports like 5900 (VNC), 22 (SSH), or 3389 (Remote Desktop)
, someone may be remotely accessing your Mac.

🚀 Final Steps: What to Do If You Find Something Suspicious

Google the process name
 to see if it's legit.

Check where it’s running from
 using:

sh

Copy

Edit

which

 processname

Kill the process
 if it looks suspicious:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 PID

Delete any unknown startup services
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/com.suspicious.agent.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.suspicious.daemon.plist

Monitor your system in real-time
 using
