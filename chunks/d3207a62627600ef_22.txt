Step 2: DNS Nameserver 
113.212.173.22
 is Still Present 🚨

Even after changing the DNS settings, 
the unwanted nameserver is still there.
 This suggests it may be:

Manually configured by a hidden process or script.

Set by your router (forcing devices to use it).

A sign of a network-level hijack (if unknown to you).

🛠 Fixing This – Let's Try a Stronger Reset

We need to 
manually override all network connections.

1️⃣ Force-Remove the Bad DNS Setting

Run this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi empty

👉 This 
removes all DNS servers
 from Wi-Fi.

Now, 
add back trusted DNS servers
 (Google DNS as an example):

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

If you're on 
Ethernet
, do the same for it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet empty
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

2️⃣ Check If the Unwanted DNS is Gone

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

📌 
Is 
113.212.173.22
 still there?
 If so, we need to 
dig deeper.

3️⃣ Investigate If Your Router is Injecting the DNS

Sometimes, 
your router forces DNS settings
. Let’s check:

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /etc/resolv.conf

👉 If 
113.212.173.22
 appears here, your 
router is forcing this DNS.

4️⃣ Override Router DNS via Mac’s Hosts File (If Necessary)

If the DNS keeps coming back, we can 
force override DNS resolution
 using 
/etc/hosts
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo nano /etc/hosts

At the 
bottom
 of the file, add:

Copy

Edit

8.8.8.8 google.com
8.8.4.4 google.com

Save and exit
 (
CTRL + X
, 
Y
, 
Enter
).

Then, flush DNS again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

🚀 Next Step: Run 
scutil --dns
 Again & Let Me Know If That Nameserver is Gone!

If 
113.212.173.22
 is 
still there
, then:

Your 
router is forcing it
 (you’ll need to log into your router settings and manually change DNS).

Or, 
a hidden process is setting it
 (we’ll scan for it next). 🚀

Step 2: Fixing Ethernet DNS Hijacking 🚨

Since you're on 
Ethernet
, the rogue nameserver 

113.212.173.22

 may be coming from your 
router
 or a hidden network configuration. Let’s take a 
stronger
 approach to remove it.

🛠 Step 1: Force Reset Ethernet DNS

Run the following 
two commands
 to remove and replace your Ethernet DNS settings:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet empty
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

👉 This 
removes all existing DNS settings
 and replaces them with 
Google DNS
.

Now, 
flush DNS
 to apply the change:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

🔍 Step 2: Check If the Rogue DNS is Gone

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

📌 
If 
113.212.173.22
 is gone
, the issue is fixed.

📌 
If it’s still there
, then 
your router is forcing it
 or a hidden process is injecting it.

🛠 Step 3: Check If Your Router is Forcing DNS

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /etc/resolv.conf

👉 
If 
113.212.173.22
 appears here
, your 
router is overriding your DNS settings
.

🚀 If The Router is the Problem:

1️⃣ 
Log into your router settings

Open your browser and go to:

cpp

Copy

Edit

//192.168.1.1

http:

//192.168.0.1
