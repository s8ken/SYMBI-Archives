Ah, macOS 
doesn't always use "Ethernet" as the exact network service name
. We need to find the correct name for your wired connection first.

Step 1: Find Your Network Service Name

Run this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

networksetup -listallnetworkservices

📌 
Look for the correct name of your Ethernet connection.
 It might be named:

Ethernet

USB Ethernet

Thunderbolt Ethernet

USB 10/100/1000 LAN

Something else entirely!

Step 2: Reset DNS for the Correct Ethernet Service

Once you find the correct name, run these commands (replacing 
YourEthernetName
 with the actual name):

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers 

"YourEthernetName"

 empty
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers 

"YourEthernetName"

 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

Then, 
flush DNS cache
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

Step 3: Check If the Bad DNS is Gone

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

📌 
Let me know if 
113.212.173.22
 is still there!

Step 1: Reset DNS for Ethernet (USB 10/100/1000 LAN)

Since your Ethernet connection is labeled 

USB 10/100/1000 LAN

, let’s force-reset its DNS settings.

Step 2: Remove the Rogue DNS & Set a Trusted One

Run these commands 
exactly
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers 

"USB 10/100/1000 LAN"

 empty
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers 

"USB 10/100/1000 LAN"

 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

Then, 
flush the DNS cache
 to apply the changes:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

Step 3: Check If the Rogue DNS is Gone

Now, check your DNS settings again:

sh

Copy

Edit

scutil --dns

📌 
If 
113.212.173.22
 is gone
, the issue is fixed. ✅

📌 
If it’s still there
, your 
VPN or router might be enforcing it.

Step 4: (If Still Present) Check If VPN is Forcing DNS

You have 
ProtonVPN
 active, which might be enforcing its own DNS settings.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

cat

 /etc/resolv.conf

👉 
If 
113.212.173.22
 appears here
, ProtonVPN (or your router) is 
overriding your DNS settings.

👉 
Try disconnecting ProtonVPN
 and check 

scutil --dns

 again.

🚀 Next Step: Run 
scutil --dns
 Again & Let Me Know If That Nameserver is Gone!

If 

113.212.173.22
 disappears
, the issue is resolved.

If it 
remains
, we'll need to investigate ProtonVPN or your router! 🚀
