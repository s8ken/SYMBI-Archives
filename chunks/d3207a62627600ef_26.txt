d)

Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Vivaldi
 may be making 
background connections
 to check for:

Safe Browsing updates (malware protection).

Automatic updates for the browser itself.

Extensions calling Google services.

Check if Chrome is running in the background
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep 

"Chrome"

If it shows up, you can 
force close Chrome
 and run 
netstat
 again:

sh

Copy

Edit

killall 

"Google Chrome"

2️⃣ 
Google DNS

You recently 
set your DNS to 
8.8.8.8
 and 
8.8.4.4

, which means 
your Mac queries Google’s DNS servers
.

Even if you're not logged into Google, your device 
still makes connections to resolve domain names.

Want to avoid Google DNS?
 You can switch to Cloudflare’s DNS:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo networksetup -setdnsservers 

"USB 10/100/1000 LAN"

 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1

3️⃣ 
macOS System Services

Some macOS 
background processes
 (like Captive Portal detection) may ping Google servers.

Try running:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

This will tell us 
which process is making the connection.

4️⃣ 
Any Installed Apps Using Google APIs

Some apps (even non-Google ones) use 
Google Cloud Services
 or 
Google Firebase
 for:

Push notifications

Analytics

Cloud sync

🛠️ What To Do Next

🔹 
If you want to investigate further, run this command
 to check 
which app is making the Google connection
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

📌 
Let me know what app shows up, and we’ll decide if it’s normal or suspicious.

🔍 No Chrome Running – But Still Google Connections?

✅ 
You confirmed that Chrome is NOT running
, but your Mac 
still has an active connection to 
142.250.70.164
 (Google-owned server).

That means 
something else
 is making that request.

🛠 Step 1: Find the Process Making the Google Connection

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

📌 
This will show the exact process that is talking to Google.

Possible Causes (If Not Chrome)

1️⃣ 
A Background macOS Service

macOS sometimes 
pings Google servers
 to check internet connectivity.

Process to look for:

configd
 (networking), 
trustd
 (certificate validation).

2️⃣ 
An App Using Google Services

Some non-Google apps 
use Google APIs for syncing or analytics.

Examples:
 Slack, Discord, Spotify, etc.

3️⃣ 
A Hidden Background Process

If an unknown process is making the connection, 
we need to investigate further
.

🚀 Next Step: Run the 
lsof
 Command & Tell Me What Process is Making the Connection

Once we know 
which app is responsible
, we can decide if it's 
safe or suspicious.

✅ No Process Found – What Does This Mean?

You ran:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 

"142.250.70.164"

…and 
nothing showed up
, meaning:

1️⃣ 
Your Mac is no longer actively connected to Google at this moment.

2️⃣ The previous connection to 
142.250.70.164

was temporary
 (likely a system service or app that no longer needs it).

3️⃣ If it was 
malicious
, it 
isn’t running anymore
, so there’s no immediate risk.

🛠 Want to Keep Monitoring?

If you want to 
catch future connections in real-time
, use this command:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

📌 
Run it periodically to check for new active connections.

🚀 Final Check – Do You Want to Hunt for Hidden Processes?

If you 
still feel suspicious
, we can:

Run KnockKnock
 to find hidden startup malware:

sh

Edit

brew install --cask knockknock
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app
