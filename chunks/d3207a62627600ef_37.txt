of your Mac
. It’s useful for detecting 
spyware, keyloggers, or suspicious connections
.

🛠 Setup:

1️⃣ Open 
Wireshark
 (
Applications → Wireshark.app
)

2️⃣ Click 
"Capture" → "Options"

3️⃣ Select 
your active network interface
 (
en0
 for Wi-Fi, 
en4
 for Ethernet)

4️⃣ Click 
"Start Capture"

5️⃣ Let it run for a few minutes, then 
stop the capture & analyze traffic

Look for unknown IPs or repeated connections to servers you don’t recognize.

If you see a 
strange domain or IP
, investigate further with:

sh

Copy

Edit

whois [IP_ADDRESS]

✅ 
Wireshark now lets you monitor network traffic for anything suspicious!
 🕵️‍♂️

🚀 Final Security Checklist

✅ 
LuLu is blocking unknown network connections.

✅ 
Do Not Disturb alerts you to physical access attempts.

✅ 
OverSight prevents hidden mic/camera activation.

✅ 
Wireshark lets you analyze all network activity.

✅ 
Your Mac is now a fortress.
 🔒🔥

🎯 What’s Next?

👉 Do you want to 
monitor any specific apps with Wireshark?

👉 Do you need help 
analyzing network traffic logs?

👉 Are there any 
suspicious alerts from OverSight or LuLu
 you want to investigate?

Let me know if you want 
any fine-tuning
 or if we can call this 
mission accomplished!

You've got a solid set of security tools installed: 
LuLu, Do Not Disturb, Oversight, and Wireshark
. Let's go through how to configure them properly.

1. LuLu – Configuring the Firewall

LuLu is a firewall that blocks unknown outbound connections.

Set up rules for maximum security:

Open LuLu.

Click on 
Rules
.

Review existing rules – remove any unnecessary ones.

Set rules to 
Block All Unknown Connections
:

Click 
Preferences
 → 
Block Unknown Connections
.

This ensures any new outgoing connection needs

can you check this output from Wireshark?

I've analyzed the output from Wireshark. Here are some observations and recommendations based on the packet capture:

1. Suspicious Traffic

Frequent connections to IPs outside your network

Example: 
b9|46|2a|2b
 and 
11|f8|9b|c4

This could indicate potential C2 (Command and Control) traffic or unauthorized data exfiltration.

Unusual Multicast Traffic (
01|00|5e|7f|ff|fa
)

This is an IPv4 multicast address; common for network services, but could be used for network discovery or lateral movement in an attack.

If you don’t recognize the device sending these, monitor it.

DNS Traffic to External Servers (
113.212.173.22
 previously found)

This was changed, but worth investigating if any DNS queries are still going to unknown servers.

2. Possible Remote Administration Tools (RATs)

TCP connections to high random ports (
58256
, 
58258
)

Could be part of a remote desktop or RAT.

Verify active connections with:

sh

Copy

Edit

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

Encrypted Traffic to Cloudflare IPs (
104.18.32.47
, 
104.18.41.158
)

Cloudflare can be a CDN or a cover for malicious traffic.

Check your open browser tabs, VPN, or proxy settings.

3. Next Steps

Run a Deeper Analysis

Check running processes
:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i remote
ps aux | grep -i agent

Verify active network connections
:

sh

Copy

Edit

lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

Scan for known malware with ClamAV
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo clamscan -r / --bell --

log

=/var/log/clamav_scan.log

Use Wireshark filters to isolate suspicious activity
:

tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==1
 → Find established connections

ip.addr == <suspicious IP>
 → Track specific connections

Monitor outbound traffic using LuLu
:

Set it to block unknown outbound connections.

Log everything and review what’s trying to access the internet.

Conclusion

If you see 
continuous outbound traffic to unrecognized IPs
, you may have 
a backdoor, a trojan, or unauthorized remote access
.

The multicast and Cloudflare connections should be ex
