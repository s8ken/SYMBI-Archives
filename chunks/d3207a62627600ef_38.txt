Are you using a VPN or proxy?
 If not, it’s worth digging into.

Enable Oversight to monitor camera/microphone access
 and check for unauthorized remote sessions.

🛑 VPN Not Running, But Cloudflare & Suspicious Traffic Found – Possible Remote Access?

Since 
your VPN isn’t running
, but we still see outbound connections to 
Cloudflare IPs (
104.18.32.47
, 
104.18.41.158
)
 and 
high-numbered ports (
58256
, 
58258
)
, this 
could be a sign of:

1️⃣ 
A backdoor or Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
 secretly exfiltrating data.

2️⃣ 
A hidden service using Cloudflare as a proxy
 (some malware does this to hide its C2 server).

3️⃣ 
A misconfigured system process reaching out unnecessarily
 (less likely).

🚀 Next Steps – Let’s Investigate Further

Now that we suspect 
possible unauthorized remote access
, let’s go deeper:

1️⃣ Check Active Network Connections (Again)

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

📌 This will show 
which process is responsible for the connections
 to Cloudflare or other unknown IPs.

2️⃣ Find the Process Using High-Numbered Ports (
58256
, 
58258
)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -anp | grep 5825

📌 If this shows a 
process name and PID (Process ID)
, we can trace it further.

3️⃣ Scan for Remote Access Tools (RATs)

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i remote
ps aux | grep -i agent
ps aux | grep -i vnc

📌 This checks for 
known remote access programs
 like 
TeamViewer, AnyDesk, RATs, or hidden remote shells
.

4️⃣ Check for Hidden Users on Your Mac

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

dscl . list /Users

📌 Look for 
any unknown user accounts
 that shouldn’t be there.

5️⃣ Monitor Your Microphone & Camera (OverSight)

Since 
some malware uses Cloudflare to exfiltrate audio/video recordings
, keep 
OverSight running
 to catch any unauthorized access:

sh

Copy

Edit

open /Applications/OverSight.app

📌 If anything tries to use your 
camera/mic
, 
OverSight will warn you!

6️⃣ Block Unknown Outbound Traffic with LuLu

If you see 
an unknown process using Cloudflare
, 
block it in LuLu
:

1️⃣ Open 
LuLu
 → 
Rules

2️⃣ 
Manually block connections to 
104.18.32.47
, 
104.18.41.158

3️⃣ 
Deny any new outbound connections from unknown apps

🛑 No Active Network Connections Found – What This Means

✅ You ran:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep ESTABLISHED

…and 
nothing appeared
. This means:

1️⃣ 
No active outbound connections exist right now.

2️⃣ 
Whatever was connecting to Cloudflare earlier has stopped.

3️⃣ 
The suspicious activity could have been temporary or stealth-based.

🚀 Next Steps – Let’s Dig Deeper

Even though no active connections 
right now
, we should still check 
if anything left traces behind.

1️⃣ Find What Was Using Ports 
58256
, 
58258

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -anp | grep 5825

📌 This checks if any process 
recently used these high-numbered ports
.

2️⃣ Look for Hidden Remote Access Tools (RATs)

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i remote
ps aux | grep -i agent
ps aux | grep -i vnc

📌 
If you see anything unusual
, let me know!

3️⃣ Check for Hidden Users on Your Mac

sh

Copy

Edit

dscl . list /Users

📌 If you see any 
weird or unknown usernames
, someone may have 
created a hidden account for persistence
.

4️⃣ List All Scheduled Background Tasks

Some malware 
hides in scheduled tasks
. Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo crontab -l
crontab -l

📌 
If anything weird shows up
, let me know!

5️⃣ Monitor Live Network Traffic in Wireshark

If you suspect 
something might still be active
, open 
Wireshark
 and
