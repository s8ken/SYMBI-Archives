🔍 Reverse Lookup for 
151.101.3.6
 – No Domain Found (
NXDOMAIN
)

Your 

dig -x 151.101.3.6

 request returned 
NXDOMAIN
 (Non-Existent Domain), meaning:

The IP is valid but does not resolve to a known hostname.

It belongs to an organization that does not publicly expose reverse DNS records.

It could be a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Fastly or Cloudflare, often used by websites & apps.

🛠 Next Steps – Let’s Investigate Further

✅ 
Run 
dig
 for the second IP (
185.70.42.22
)

sh

Copy

Edit

dig -x 185.70.42.22

📌 This will check if the 
second IP has an identifiable hostname.

✅ 
Check If Any Process Is Using These IPs

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 151.101.3.6
sudo lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22

📌 
This tells us which app is responsible for these connections.

✅ 
Use 
whois
 from an External Source (If macOS Blocks It)

Since 
whois
 timed out earlier, try using 
an online WHOIS lookup tool
:

🔹 
For 
151.101.3.6

 → 
WHOIS Lookup

🔹 
For 
185.70.42.22

 → 
WHOIS Lookup

📌 If 
151.101.3.6
 is a 
CDN like Fastly, Cloudflare, or Akamai
, it’s likely safe.

📌 If 

185.70.42.22
 is unknown
, we should 
block it in LuLu until we confirm it’s safe
.

🚀 Next Step: Run 
dig -x 185.70.42.22
 and 
lsof
 & Let Me Know What You Find!

🔍 If 
an unknown process is using these IPs
, we’ll find and block it. 🚀

🔍 Reverse Lookup for 
185.70.42.22
 – Belongs to ProtonMail (
protonmail.ch
)

Your 

dig -x 185.70.42.22

 request confirms that this IP belongs to 
ProtonMail
 (🇨🇭 Switzerland).

🛠 What This Means

✅ 
If you use ProtonMail or ProtonVPN
, this IP is likely a 
Proton service checking for updates or handling encrypted mail traffic
.

❌ 
If you don’t use ProtonMail/VPN right now
, it’s worth investigating 
why your Mac is still connecting to Proton servers.

🚀 Next Steps – Let’s Confirm What’s Using ProtonMail’s IP

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep 185.70.42.22

📌 This will 
show the exact process or app
 on your Mac making connections to ProtonMail.

🛑 Should You Block This IP?

✅ 
If you’re actively using ProtonMail or ProtonVPN
 → 
No action needed
 (expected behavior).

❌ 
If you aren’t running ProtonVPN/Mail right now
 → 
Possible hidden process or residual connection.

Check running ProtonVPN processes:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i proton

If ProtonVPN is 
not running
, but this connection is 
active
, consider 
blocking it in LuLu
:

Open LuLu → Rules

Block outgoi
