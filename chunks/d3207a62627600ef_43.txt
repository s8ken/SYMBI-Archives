✅ These 
are still listening for incoming connections
, meaning 
something is running that can accept remote access.

🚨 
We need to find out which processes are responsible for these ports.

🚀 Step 1: Find Which Process Owns These Ports

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :49172
sudo lsof -i :5000
sudo lsof -i :7000

📌 This will show 
which applications or services are using these ports.

🚀 Step 2: If These Are Unwanted, Kill Them

Once you find the 
process ID (PID)
 from the previous step, kill the process:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 [PID]

📌 Replace 
[PID]
 with the actual process ID.

🚀 Step 3: Disable Any Startup Services Running on These Ports

If these processes restart after you kill them, 
they might be running as background daemons.

To check startup services:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"49172|5000|7000"

📌 If any service appears, 
disable it with:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl 

disabl
