actually before we do that - can we run a quick report for see what accessibility options have been changed in the last 24 hours?

🛠 Check Recent Changes to Accessibility Settings in macOS

Since accessibility settings 
can be abused for remote access (e.g., keyloggers, remote control software, malware injections)
, let’s check if 
anything was changed in the last 24 hours.

🚀 Step 1: Check Accessibility Apps with Full Control

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

tccutil dump Accessibility

📌 This will list all apps with 
Accessibility permissions (which can control your system).

📌 
If anything looks suspicious, we can remove it.

🚀 Step 2: Check Recent Security & Privacy Changes

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.TCC"'

 --last 24h

📌 
This lists all permission changes in the last 24 hours.

📌 Look for 
any app gaining Accessibility, Screen Recording, or Input Monitoring access.

🚀 Step 3: Check for Recently Granted Accessibility Permissions

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

"SELECT service, client, allowed, prompt_count FROM access WHERE service='kTCCServiceAccessibility';"

📌 This will show 
which apps have Accessibility permissions
 and if they were recently added.

🚀 Step 4: Check If System Logs Show Accessibility Changes

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

log

 show --info --last 24h | grep -i accessibility

📌 This looks for 
any system logs mentioning Accessibility changes.

🚀 Step 5: Check If Any Unknown App Has Gained Full Control

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccessAuthWarning

📌 
If anything unexpected shows up, we can remove it!

🚀 What’s Next?

✅ 
Run these commands
 and send me the output if 
anything suspicious appears.

🚨 If 
an unknown app has gained Accessibility access
, we will 
revoke its permissions immediately.

okay so that first command produced 23mb of text file

💎 Writer Pro 💎 Copy Email Blog Essay CV +more said:

That's a 
huge amount of data
 for 
tccutil dump Accessibility
, which means 
a lot of apps or processes have requested accessibility permissions.

🚀 
Upload the text file here
, and I’ll analyze it for 
suspicious or unauthorized entries
.

🔍 We’ll specifically look for:

New apps that gained Accessibility access recently

Any suspicious processes running with full control

Possible malware using Accessibility to inject keystrokes or control the system

Once I analyze the file, we’ll 
remove anything suspicious
 and ensure no unauthorized access is happening. 🔒🚀
