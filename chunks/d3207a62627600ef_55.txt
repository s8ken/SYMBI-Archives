🛑 Ports 
5000
, 
7000
, and 
49172
 Are Still Open – Let’s Shut Them Down Completely

Since these ports are 
still listening
, even after disabling 
rapportd
 and 
ControlCe
, we’ll use a 
stronger method
 to 
identify and block
 them permanently. 🚨

🚀 Step 1: Identify the Process Keeping These Ports Open

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i :5000
sudo lsof -i :7000
sudo lsof -i :49172

📌 
This tells us what process is keeping these ports open.

📌 
Post the results here
, and we’ll disable or remove it.

🚀 Step 2: Check If These Ports Are Open Due to a System Daemon

Since 
launchctl disable

didn’t fully close them
, let’s check 
if they’re being restarted automatically by macOS
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"5000|7000|49172"

📌 
If any services show up, we will manually disable them.

🚀 Step 3: Use the Firewall to Block These Ports

Even if a process is 
trying to listen
, we can 
block all incoming connections
 using the macOS firewall.

1️⃣ Enable Stealth Mode & Block All Incoming Traffic

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setblockall on

📌 
This makes your Mac invisible on the network and blocks ALL incoming connections.

2️⃣ Manually Block These Ports Using 
pfctl

Since the firewall 
doesn’t let you block specific ports easily
, we’ll use 
Packet Filter (
pfctl
)
.

Create a Firewall Rule to Block Ports 5000, 7000, and 49172

Run This to Create the Rule:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

"block drop in proto tcp from any to any port {5000, 7000, 49172}"

 | sudo pfctl -f -

📌 
This blocks all incoming traffic on these ports.

Enable Packet Filter (
pfctl
)

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo pfctl -e

📌 
This enforces the new rule immediately.

Verify That the Rule is Active

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo pfctl -sr

📌 This 
confirms that the firewall is blocking these ports.

🚀 Step 4: Confirm That Ports Are Now Closed

After applying all steps, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 If 
5000
, 
7000
, and 
49172

are gone
, you are 
fully locked down.
 🔒

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ 
Run 
lsof
 and 
launchctl
 to see what’s keeping these ports open.

2️⃣ **Apply the 
pfctl
 firewall rule

🛑 
ControlCe
 & 
rapportd
 Are Still Running – Let’s Permanently Disable & Remove Them

Even after previous attempts, 
these two processes are still listening for remote connections
:

ControlCe

(Control Center)
 is still using 
ports 5000 & 7000

rapportd

(Apple's remote device service)
 is still using 
port 49172

🚨 
We need to fully kill them and prevent them from restarting.
 🚨

🚀 Step 1: Kill These Processes Immediately

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 2910
sudo 

kill

 -9 593

📌 This 
forcefully stops both processes
.

🚀 Step 2: Prevent 
ControlCe
 (Control Center) from
