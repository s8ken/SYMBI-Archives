 Restarting

Since 
ControlCe
 keeps coming back, it is being 
auto-relaunched
 by macOS.

To 
disable it permanently
, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This prevents macOS from automatically restarting Control Center.

🚀 Step 3: Prevent 
rapportd
 from Restarting

Even after previous attempts, 
rapportd
 is still running.

Disable it again:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl bootout system /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
This prevents 
rapportd
 from running again.

🚀 Step 4: Verify That These Services Are Now Disabled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"controlcenter|rapportd"

📌 
If they no longer appear, they are fully disabled.
 ✅

🚀 Step 5: Block These Ports at the Firewall

Even if 
ControlCe
 or 
rapportd
 tries to restart, we 
block all network traffic to these ports.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

"block drop in proto tcp from any to any port {500

🛑 
ControlCe
 (Control Center) Cannot Be Disabled via 
launchctl
 – Let’s Use a Stronger Method

Since 

launchctl bootout
 failed
, macOS 
is forcing Control Center to stay active.
 🚨

We need to take 
stronger measures
 to stop it from launching automatically.

🚀 Step 1: Kill 
ControlCe
 Again (To Stop It Temporarily)

Since it is still running, force-kill it 
again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 2910

📌 
This will stop Control Center until it tries to restart again.

🚀 Step 2: Check If Control Center Is Restarting from 
launchd

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep control

📌 If it appears, 
we will need to remove its launch configuration manually.

🚀 Step 3: Manually Remove Control Center’s Auto-Launch Config

Since 
launchctl bootout

failed
, let’s manually 
delete its startup file.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This removes the file that tells macOS to launch Control Center at startup.

✅ 
ControlCe
 (Control Center) is No Longer Running – Let’s Verify & Prevent It from Restarting
 🎉

Since 

kill -9 2910
 returned "No such process,"
 that means 
Control Center is no longer running.
 🔒

🚀 Step 1: Confirm That Control Center is Fully Disabled

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

📌 
If nothing appears
, Control Center is 
no longer active.
 ✅

🚀 Step 2: Confirm No More Open Ports

Now, check if 
ports 5000, 7000, and 49172 are finally closed
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 
If these ports no longer show up, your Mac is fully secured!
 🔥

🚀 Step 3: Prevent Control Center from Ever Restarting (Optional)

Since 
Control Center is now gone
, let’s make sure 
macOS can’t restart it in the future
:

1️⃣ 
Check if the launch agent still exists:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 /System/Library/LaunchAgents | grep control

2️⃣ 
If it’s still there, remove it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This stops macOS from trying to restart Control Center at login.

🚀 Step 4: Final Security Check

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl list | grep control

📌 
If nothing appears, Control Center is fully removed.
 ✅

🎯 Next Steps

✅ 
If 
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
 no longer shows ports 5000, 7000, or 49172, your Mac is now fully locked down.
 🔒

✅ 
If Control Center no longer appears in 
ps aux | grep ControlCe
, it is fully removed.

🚀 
Run the final verification checks and let me know if we can officially call this mission accomplished!
 🎉🔥
