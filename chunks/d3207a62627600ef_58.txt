🛑 Control Center is Still Restarting – Let’s Fully Remove It from the System

Even after disabling it with 
launchctl
, 
Control Center (
ControlCe
) restarted (PID 3099).

🚨 This means macOS is 
forcing it to stay active
, and we need a 
stronger approach to stop it permanently
.

🚀 Step 1: Kill Control Center Again

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 3099

📌 
This will stop it temporarily, but we need to prevent macOS from relaunching it.

🚀 Step 2: Delete the Control Center Auto-Launch File

Since 
launchctl disable

didn’t work
, we will 
delete the launch agent manually
.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This removes the file that macOS uses to auto-launch Control Center.

🚀 Step 3: Prevent macOS from Reinstalling Control Center

Even after deleting the auto-launch file, macOS 
might try to restore it
 on reboot.

To prevent this, 
block execution of Control Center’s binary
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

📌 
This makes the file unexecutable, permanently disabling it.

🚀 Step 4: Confirm Control Center is Fully Gone

1️⃣ 
Check if it’s still running:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

📌 If 
no output appears
, it’s gone. ✅

2️⃣ 
Verify no ports are open:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 If ports 
5000, 7000, and 49172 are gone
, your Mac is now 
fully secured!
 🔒

🚀 Final Check: Restart Your Mac

To confirm Control Center 
does not restart
, reboot your system:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After rebooting, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCe

📌 If it 
does not appear
, Control Center is permanently disabled. ✅

🚀 
Try these steps and let me know if Control Center is finally gone!
 🔥🔒

🛑 System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Blocking Deletion – Let's Work Around It

macOS 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 is 
preventing you from deleting Control Center’s launch file
.

🚨 
Since SIP is active, we need to either work around it or temporarily disable it.

🚀 Option 1: Workaround Without Disabling SIP

Since we 
can’t delete the file directly
, we can 
override it instead
.

1️⃣ Replace the Control Center Launch File with an Empty File

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

echo

""

 | sudo 

tee

 /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This replaces the file with an empty one, preventing macOS from launching Control Center.

2️⃣ Set the File to Read-Only

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo chflags schg /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 This 
locks the file, preventing macOS from modifying or restoring it.

🚀 Option 2: Temporarily Disable SIP (Last Resort)

If 
Option 1 doesn’t work
, we need to 
disable SIP
, delete the file, and re-enable SIP.

1️⃣ Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode

Restart your Mac and hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 until you see the Apple logo.

Go to Utilities → Terminal
