 
is ignoring this
.

This 
could indicate that macOS is forcing it to stay active for some reason
.

3️⃣ Hard to Disable Due to SIP Protection

SIP (System Integrity Protection) prevents you from deleting or modifying Control Center.

This means even an admin user can’t fully remove it without disabling SIP.

If a 
malicious process hijacks Control Center
, 
it could gain persistent system-level access
.

4️⃣ Possible Connection to Apple’s Remote Services

Apple uses 
rapportd
 for device syncing and Continuity features.

However, 
rapportd
 is also listening on an open port (49172)
.

If these services are talking to 
external Apple servers
, it might be for diagnostics, updates, or analytics.

If 
you don’t use Continuity, Handoff, or Universal Clipboard
, there’s 
no reason for these services to stay open
.

🛠️ How a Hacker Could Exploit This

An attacker 
inside your network
 (or malware already on your system) could:

1️⃣ 
Scan your open ports (
5000
, 
7000
, 
49172
)

2️⃣ 
Use a local exploit
 to inject code into these system services

3️⃣ 
Hijack Control Center to maintain persistence

4️⃣ 
Gain access to your system without triggering antivirus alerts

📌 
This is why persistence + open ports = a red flag
 🚨.

🔍 Is This a Critical Risk?

🟢 LOW Risk If
:

✅ You’re 
on a trusted network
 (home, private VPN).

✅ You’ve 
blocked all inbound traffic
 using the macOS firewall (
socketfilterfw
).

✅ You’ve 
verified no suspicious outgoing connections
 (
lsof -i -P
).

✅ You’ve 
disabled remote access, screen sharing, SSH, and remote login
.

🔴 HIGH Risk If
:

❌ You’re 
on a public or shared network
.

❌ You’ve 
seen unknown outbound traffic
 in 
Wireshark or LuLu
.

❌ You’ve noticed 
unusual system behavior (slowness, high CPU, unknown apps running).

❌ The 
same ports (5000, 7000, 49172) are still open even after firewall blocking.

🚀 Recommended Actions

If you’re concerned, take these 
extra security steps
:

1️⃣ Monitor Network Traffic in Real-Time

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo tcpdump -i any port 5000 or port 7000 or port 49172

📌 If 
you see unexpected traffic
, it means something is actively using these ports.

2️⃣ Block Outbound Traffic for Control Center & 
rapportd

Even if we 
can’t delete them
, we can 
prevent them from talking to the internet.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockApp /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockApp /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This blocks these services from sending or receiving data over the network.

3️⃣ Disable SIP, Remove Control Center, and Re-enable SIP

If you 
want full control over your system
, the 
only way to permanently disable Control Center
 is:

1️⃣ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command ⌘ + R
 on startup).

2️⃣ 
Disable SIP:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

3️⃣ 
Reboot and delete Control Center’s files:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

4️⃣ 
Re-enable SIP for security:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

🚨 
WARNING:

Only disable SIP if you are absolutely sure you want Control Center gone forever.

SIP protects system files from malware, so turning it off can weaken your system security.

🎯 Conclusion – Should You Be Worried?

🔹 
If the ports are still open after all attempts, it is a security risk.

🔹 
If you see suspicious network activity (
tcpdump
 shows active connections), it is a security risk.

🔹 
If you are on a public network or suspect malware, fully remove Control Center.

📌 
If ports 5000, 7000, and 49172 are still open, let’s take the next step and fully block them.

🚀 
What do you want to do next? Try blocking outbound traffic first, or go straight to removing Control Center completely?
