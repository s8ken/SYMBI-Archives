t disable it again
 to proceed.

1️⃣ 
Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode (
⌘ + R
 on startup).

2️⃣ 
Open Terminal in Recovery Mode

3️⃣ 
Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

4️⃣ 
Reboot back into normal macOS.

🚀 Step 2: Kill the Processes Again

Once back in macOS, 
force kill them again
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

kill

 -9 625
sudo 

kill

 -9 616

📌 
This will stop them temporarily so we can delete them.

🚀 Step 3: Completely Remove Their Executables

1️⃣ Make Sure Files are Writable

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo chflags nouchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo chflags nouchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This removes macOS write-protection.

2️⃣ Delete the Binaries Permanently

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This removes them so they cannot restart.

🚀 Step 4: Remove Auto-Launch Configuration

Even if the binaries are deleted, 
macOS may still try to auto-launch them.

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
This removes the system instructions that tell macOS to restart them.

🚀 Step 5: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

Once rebooted, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 
If nothing appears, you have successfully removed them!
 🎉

🚀 Step 6: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
they are gone
, reboot into 
Recovery Mode (
⌘ + R
 on boot)
 and run:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
This restores system protections.

🎯 Final Steps

✅ 
Disable SIP again (
csrutil disable
)

✅ 
Force kill the processes again (
kill -9
)

✅ 
Delete their executables & launch files

✅ 
Reboot & confirm they are gone (
ps aux | grep ControlCe
)

✅ 
Re-enable SIP for security (
csrutil enable
)

🚀 
Try this and let me know if they are FINALLY removed!

🛑 "Read-only file system" – SIP is Still Blocking Deletion! 🚨

Even after 
disabling SIP
, macOS is 
still enforcing a read-only system state
, preventing removal of 
Control Center (
ControlCe
) and 
rapportd

.

🔴 
The problem:

/System/Library
 is still mounted as 
read-only
, so you cannot modify or delete system files.

✅ 
The solution:

We need to manually remount the filesystem as writable before deleting the files.

🚀 Step 1: Boot into macOS Recovery Mode Again

Since SIP is still enforcing protections, we need to 
fully remount the filesystem in Recovery Mode
.

1️⃣ 
Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode
:

Restart your Mac

Hold 
Command (⌘) + R
 immediately
 until the Apple logo appears

Select 
"Disk Utility"
 → Click 
"Mount"
 on your main macOS disk

Quit Disk Utility

Open Terminal
 from the Utilities menu

2️⃣ 
Disable SIP Again
 (if not already done):

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

disable

3️⃣ 
Remount the filesystem as writable:

sh

Copy

Edit

mount -uw /

📌 
This will force 
/System/Library
 into writable mode, allowing you to delete files.

🚀 Step 2: Permanently Remove Control Center & 
rapportd

Now that the system is writable, try deleting them again:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

📌 
This will remove the executables & launch configurations so they cannot restart.

🚀 Step 3: Reboot & Confirm They Are Gone

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

Once back in normal macOS, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo netstat -an | grep LISTEN

📌 
If no output appears, you have successfully removed them!
 🎉

🚀 Step 4: Re-enable SIP for Security

If everything is gone, 
go back to Recovery Mode (
⌘ + R
 on boot)
 and run:

sh

Cop
