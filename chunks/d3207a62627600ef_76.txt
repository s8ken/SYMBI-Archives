 
rapportd
 and Control Center to a Fake Location

Instead of deleting them (which macOS may restore), 
move them
 to break their functionality:

sh

Copy

Edit

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak

mv

 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.bak

📌 
Now, macOS can’t find the real executables.

Now, 
replace them with fake, non-executable files
:

sh

Copy

Edit

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

touch

 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app
chflags uchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app

📌 
This makes them permanently unusable and blocks macOS from restoring them.

🚀 Step 4: Remove the Launch Daemons That Restore Them

Delete any auto-restart files:

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.controlcenter.plist

📌 
This ensures macOS does not restart them at boot.

🚀 Step 5: Clear the System Cache That Keeps Restoring Them

sh

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.rapportd*

rm

 -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.controlcenter*

rm

 -rf /private/var/db/dyld/*

📌 
Now, macOS has no cached versions of these processes.

🚀 Step 6: Reboot & Confirm Removal

Now, 
restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

reboot

After booting, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

sudo launchctl list | grep -E 

"ControlCe|rapportd"

📌 
If no output appears, they are FINALLY gone! 🎉

🚀 Step 7: Re-enable SIP for Security

Once confirmed 
that they are gone
, 
restore SIP to protect your system
:

sh

Copy

Edit

csrutil 

enable

📌 
Done!
 🚀 
Try this in Recovery Mode and let me know if both 
rapportd
 and Control Center are FINALLY removed. 🔥🔒

🛑 If 
mv
 Fails with "No Such File or Directory," Here’s What to Do 🚨

🔥 
This means 
rapportd
 and/or Control Center may have been removed already OR their paths are slightly different.

🚀 
We need to verify their exact locations before proceeding.

🚀 Step 1: Check If 
rapportd
 and Control Center Are Still Present

Run the following commands to check their locations:

sh

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la /usr/libexec/ | grep rapportd

ls

 -la /System/Library/CoreServices/ | grep ControlCenter

📌 
If nothing appears, 
rapportd
 and Control Center are already gone! 🎉

📌 
If they still exist, continue to Step 2.

🚀 Step 2: Try Moving Them Again With the Correct Path

If 
ls
 confirms they still exist but 
mv
 fails, try this alternative move command:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

mv

 /usr/libexec/rapportd /usr/libexec/rapportd.bak
sudo 

mv

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

"/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.bak"

📌 
Notice the space in "Control Center.app" – some macOS versions use a space!

🚀 Step 3: If Moving Still Fails, Force Remove Instead

If moving 
still does not work
, you must 
force delete instead
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

rm

 -rf 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

📌 
This permanently removes them instead of moving them.

🚀 Step 4: Prevent macOS From Restoring Them

Even if 
rapportd
 and Control Center are deleted, 
macOS might restore them
.

To block this, 
create a fake, unremovable version of them
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo 

chmod

 000 /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo chflags uchg /usr/libexec/rapportd

sudo 

touch

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

sudo 

chmod

 000 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"

sudo chflags uchg 

"/System/Library/CoreServices/Control Center.app"
