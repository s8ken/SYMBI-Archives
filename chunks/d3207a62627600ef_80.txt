🛡️ Blocking 
rapportd
 and Other Unwanted Services at the Router/Firewall Level 🔥

If 
rapportd
 keeps respawning, 
blocking it at the network level
 is another powerful way to stop it. 🚀

🔥 Option 1: Block 
rapportd
 Using the Mac Firewall

Since 
rapportd
 connects to Apple's servers, you can 
block it using the built-in macOS firewall
.

Step 1: Enable the Firewall & Stealth Mode

First, make sure macOS's firewall is turned on:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on

📌 
This blocks incoming requests and makes your Mac "invisible" to network scans.

Step 2: Block 
rapportd
's Internet Access

Now, explicitly block 
rapportd
 from making network requests:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/rapportd
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --blockapp /usr/libexec/rapportd

📌 
This stops 
rapportd
 from connecting to Apple's servers.

Step 3: Verify That 
rapportd
 is Blocked

Check the firewall settings:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --listapps

📌 If 
rapportd
 is listed as 
blocked
, you’re good! 🎉

🔥 Option 2: Block 
rapportd
 at the Router (Best Method)

If 
rapportd
 is connecting to Apple's servers, you can 
block its network traffic at the router
.

Step 1: Find Out Where 
rapportd
 is Connecting

To see what servers 
rapportd
 is talking to, run:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

You’ll see output like:

nginx

Copy

Edit

rapportd

588

 sja  10u  IPv4 0x5b5a0e32dcadbb46  0t0  TCP 

192.168.1.100:52134

 -> 

17.57.145.44:443

 (ESTABLISHED)

📌 The 
last part (
17.57.145.44:443
) is the Apple server IP.

Step 2: Block These IPs in Your Router

Now, log in to your 
router admin panel
 and:

Find the 
Firewall Settings
 or 
Access Control
 section.

Add a new 
rule to block the IPs
 found in Step 1.

Set 
"Block All Connections"
 for those IPs.

📌 
This will stop 
rapportd
 from reaching Apple’s servers at all!
 🚀

🔥 Option 3: Block 
rapportd
 Using Little Snitch or Lulu (Easiest)

If you want 
a GUI method
, use 
Little Snitch
 (paid) or 
Lulu
 (free) to block network connections.

How to Block 
rapportd
 in Lulu:

Open 
Lulu
 (
/Applications/Lulu.app
).

Click 
Rules
 → 
New Rule
.

Select:

Process:

/usr/libexec/rapportd

Action:

Block

Direction:

Outgoing

Apply the rule.

📌 
Now, 
rapportd
 can’t send or receive any data!
 🔥

🚀 Final Thoughts

✅ 
Best method?

Blocking at the router
 is the most 
powerful
 way to stop 
rapportd
.

✅ 
Easy method?
 Use 
Lulu
 or 
the macOS firewall
.

✅ 
Paranoid mode?
 Do 
all three
 to make sure 
rapportd
 is fully locked down. 🔒
