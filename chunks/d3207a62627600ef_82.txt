🛡️ Using Lulu to Block 
rapportd
 (or Any Process) 🔥

Lulu is a great 
network firewall for macOS
 that can 
block outgoing connections
 for specific apps or system processes. If 
rapportd
 is still trying to connect to the internet, Lulu can 
shut it down completely
. 🚀

🔥 Step 1: Open Lulu and Add a Block Rule for 
rapportd

Open 
Lulu
 (
/Applications/Lulu.app
).

Click 
Rules
 → 
New Rule
.

Select:

Process:

/usr/libexec/rapportd

Action:

Block

Direction:

Outgoing

Click 
Save
.

📌 
This will stop 
rapportd
 from making any network requests!

🔥 Step 2: Verify if 
rapportd
 is Still Making Connections

After blocking it in Lulu, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

📌 If 
no network activity appears
, 
rapportd
 is successfully blocked! 🚀

🔥 Step 3: Enable Stealth Mode in Lulu

To 
prevent 
rapportd
 from bypassing
 the firewall:

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Preferences
.

Enable 
Stealth Mode
 (Blocks all unknown outgoing connections).

Apply changes.

📌 This ensures 
ANY unknown process (including 
rapportd
) is denied internet access
.

🔥 Step 4: Monitor 
rapportd
 for Any Activity

Since 
rapportd
 tries to auto-reconnect, 
you can monitor if it’s still trying to connect:

Open 
Lulu
.

Go to 
Network Events
.

Look for any blocked 
rapportd
 connections.

If you see 
attempted traffic
, Lulu is successfully blocking it!

📌 
If 
rapportd
 keeps trying to reconnect, it’s proof macOS is trying to force it back online!
 🚨

🔥 Step 5: Combine Lulu with Other Firewall Rules

Even though Lulu blocks outgoing traffic, macOS 
might still restart 
rapportd

.

🔒 
For MAXIMUM security, combine Lulu with:

Blocking 
rapportd
 at the macOS firewall

Disabling it via 
launchctl

Deleting any cached system files

📌 
This makes sure 
rapportd
 is neutralized at ALL levels: system, network, and process execution.

✅ Conclusion: Lulu is an Extra Lock 🔐

🚀 
Lulu blocks 
rapportd
 from sending data.

🔥 
But macOS might still restart it in the background.

🛡️ 
Use Lulu + system-level disabling for complete control!

💀 
Let me know if 
rapportd
 is still sneaky after this!

do I put anything for remote port?

No, you 
don’t
 need to specify a remote port when creating a block rule for 
rapportd
 in 
Lulu
. 🔒

✅ How to Set Up the Lulu Block Rule

When adding the 
block rule
, focus on these settings:

Process:

/usr/libexec/rapportd

Action:

Block

Direction:

Outgoing

Remote Address:

(Leave blank to block all connections)

Remote Port:

(Leave blank to block all ports)

Protocol:

(Leave as "Any")

📌 
Why leave Remote Port blank?

Leaving it blank 
blocks ALL outgoing connections
 instead of just specific ports.

This means 
rapportd

cannot communicate over any port
—even if it tries different ones. 🚀

🔥 Want to See What Ports 
rapportd
 Uses?

Before blocking, you can 
check what ports 
rapportd
 is trying to connect to
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd

This will show lines like:

markdown

Copy

Edit

rapportd  588   sja    8u  IPv4 0x...      0t0  TCP 
*:49152 (LISTEN)
rapportd  588   sja    9u  IPv6 0x...      0t0  TCP *
:443 (ESTABLISHED)

📌 The 
remote ports
 (
443
, 
49152
, etc.) are the ones 
rapportd
 is using.

✅ Best Practice: Block Everything

If you 
leave "Remote Port" blank
, Lulu 
blocks 
rapportd
 from all network traffic
, no matter what port it tries. 
This is the best option.

rapportd
 still trying to sneak past Lulu!

🔥 
Awesome! 
rapportd
 is now BLOCKED at the firewall level!
 🔥

Now, let’s 
verify that it’s completely cut off from the network
 and 
make sure it doesn’t restart itself.
 🚀

✅ Step 1: Confirm 
rapportd
 is Fully Blocked

Run this command to check if it’s still making network connections:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo lsof -i -P | grep rapportd
