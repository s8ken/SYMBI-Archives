otout system/com.apple.controlcenter
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.controlcenter

📌 
Now macOS won’t restart it at boot.

🛡️ Step 4: Make It Useless but Keep It Running

To 
apply the "zombie" method
, we 
make Control Center completely non-functional
:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

touch

 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo 

chmod

 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter
sudo chflags uchg /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlCenter

📌 
This creates a locked "ghost" version that macOS can’t replace or execute.
 🛑

🛡️ Step 5: Reboot & Verify

Restart your Mac:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo shutdown -r now

After reboot, check:

sh

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep ControlCenter
sudo lsof -i -P | grep ControlCenter
launchctl list | grep ControlCenter

📌 
If no output appears, Control Center is officially neutered.
 🎉

🚀 Final Verdict: Control Center Is Now Just an Empty Shell

✅ 
Still "exists," but can’t connect to anything.

✅ 
Still "running," but can’t be used.

✅ 
Firewall + Lulu keep it from talking to Apple.

💀 
Now you have TWO zombies locked in their cages—
rapportd
 and Control Center!

🔍 Installing Autopsy (Digital Forensics Tool) on macOS 🚀

🔥 
Autopsy
 is a powerful 
digital forensics tool
 used for analyzing files, drives, and logs. Let’s get it running on macOS.

✅ Step 1: Install Java (Required for Autopsy)

Autopsy 
requires Java
, so first, install OpenJDK:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install openjdk

After installation, 
link Java to your system path
:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

📌 
Now Java is ready!

✅ Step 2: Install Sleuth Kit (Autopsy’s Backend)

Autopsy 
relies on The Sleuth Kit
, so we install it first:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew install sleuthkit

📌 
This installs all core forensic tools Autopsy needs.

✅ Step 3: Download & Install Autopsy

Since Autopsy isn’t in Homebrew, we need to 
download and install it manually
:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads
curl -LO https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy/releases/download/autopsy-4.21.0/autopsy-4.21.0.zip
unzip autopsy-4.21.0.zip

📌 
Now we have Autopsy extracted.

✅ Step 4: Run Autopsy

To start Autopsy:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy

📌 
This launches Autopsy’s web-based interface in your browser.

🚀 Final Steps

If you get a Java error
, make sure OpenJDK is installed (
java -version
).

If Autopsy doesn’t launch
, try:

sh

Copy

Edit

chmod

 +x autopsy
./autopsy

To update Autopsy later, just download the latest version from GitHub.

🚀 
That’s it! You’re now running Autopsy on macOS.
 🔍 Let me know if you hit any issues! 💻💀
