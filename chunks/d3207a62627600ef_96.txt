Looks like Java 23 is still active despite unlinking it. Let’s 
completely remove it
 and force Java 11.

🔥 Step 1: Remove Java 23 Completely

Since unlinking didn’t work, let’s 
uninstall
 Java 23.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies openjdk

Now, verify:

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

It 
should fail
 or say "command not found." If it still shows Java 23, restart your terminal and check again.

🔥 Step 2: Re-Link Java 11

Now, 
force Java 11 to be the default
:

sh

Copy

Edit

brew 

link

 --force --overwrite openjdk@11

Confirm the change:

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

Expected output:

nginx

Copy

Edit

openjdk

 version 

"11.0.26"

2024

-XX-XX

🔥 Step 3: Set Java 11 Permanently

Even after linking, let’s 
ensure the system uses Java 11
 every time.

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

echo

'export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

echo

'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/bin:$PATH"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

🔥 Step 4: Restart Terminal & Verify

Now 
close and reopen your terminal
, then check:

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

If it 
still shows Java 23
, you might need to manually delete Java 23 files.

🔥 Step 5: Manually Delete Java 23 (If Needed)

If 
java -version

still
 shows Java 23, manually remove it:

sh

Copy

Edit

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
sudo 

rm

 -rf /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk

Then, restart the terminal and check again.

Now, Try Running Autopsy Again

Once Java 11 is confirmed as default, 
try launching Autopsy
:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy

Let me know what happens next! 🚀

You said:

sja@SJAs-MacBook-Pro bin % brew link --force --overwrite openjdk@11

Linking /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@11/11.0.26... 65 symlinks created.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH instead consider running:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
sja@SJAs-MacBook-Pro bin % java -version

🔥 
Java 11 is now set as default!
 🔥

Now, let's test 
Autopsy
 again. Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.21.0/bin
./autopsy

💡 If it 
still fails
 with 
libtsk_jni
 issues, try this fix:

sh

Copy

Edit

export

 DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:

$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

./autopsy

Alright, looks like 
Autopsy
 isn't recognizing the Java runtime. Let's force it to use 
Java 11
 explicitly. Try the following:

Step 1: Ensure Java 11 is set up correctly

Run:

sh

Copy

Edit

export

 JAVA_HOME=

"/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11"

echo

'export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11"'

 >> ~/.zshrc

source

 ~/.zshrc

Verify that Java 11 is now the active version:

sh

Copy

Edit

java -version

It should output:

nginx

Copy

Edit

openjdk

 version 

"11.0.26"

 ...

Step 2: Run Autopsy with explicit JDK path

sh

Copy
