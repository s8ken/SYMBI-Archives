 Independent Claims =E2=80=94 Draft (to be attorney=E2=80=91polished)

Claim 1 (System):

 A system com=
prising: an agent orchestration runtime; a trust scoring engine configured =
to compute a composite trust score for an agent based on a plurality of wei=
ghted pillars including transparency, consent architecture, safety override=
s, continuous validation, autonomy, and moral recognition; an identity subs=
ystem configured to associate the agent with a decentralized identifier (DI=
D) and to issue a verifiable credential comprising a trust declaration; a v=
erification subsystem configured to (i) resolve the DID according to a meth=
od among 

did:web

, 

did:key

, 

did:ethr

, and 

did:ion

, (ii) verify a crypt=
ographic proof over the trust declaration using canonicalized input data, a=
nd (iii) determine a revocation state from a status list credential; and an=
 audit subsystem configured to generate and sign an audit event including a=
 policy version and an inputs digest.

Claim 2 (M=
ethod):
