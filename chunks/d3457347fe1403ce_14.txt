Updated Abstract (drop-in replace=

Title:
 Decentralized Trust Framework for Mutual Human=
=E2=80=93AI Governance with Verifiable Identity, Credentials, and Dynamic T=
rust Scoring

Abstract:

A system and method for establishing and maintaining mutual trust between a=
 human and an AI agent using decentralized identity and verifiable credenti=
als. Both parties declare identity and capabilities; a consent negotiation =
layer grants scoped, revocable permissions; and a dynamic trust engine comp=
utes multi-factor trust scores with temporal decay and confidence intervals=
, adjusting agent autonomy accordingly. Trust state, actions, and deltas ar=
e rendered through a bidirectional visibility interface. Identities are exp=
ressed as DIDs and bound to W3C-conformant verifiable credentials; a valida=
tor enforces credential schema, signature verification, DID resolution, and=
 revocation checks. The framework supports federated reputation, portable t=
rust attestations, and auditability for compliance. The approach extends pr=
eviously disclosed mutual trust, consent, memory bonding, and trust-gate me=
thods with cryptographic proofs and standard-based attestations.  

Revised Claims (AU style; new pro=

1.
 A trust framework for a human=E2=80=93AI relationsh=
ip comprising:

(a) a decentralized identity module generating or resolving DIDs for the hu=
man and the AI agent;

(b) a verifiable credential module issuing, validating, and revoking creden=
tials that attest to identity, consent scope, and agent capability;

(c) a consent negotiation layer producing a scoped, revocable permission se=
t;

(d) a dynamic trust engine computing a multi-factor trust score with tempor=
al decay and confidence intervals from interaction telemetry;

(e) a policy actuator that adjusts agent autonomy, memory access, and actio=
n scope according to the trust score and credential status; and

(f) a bidirectional visibility interface exposing trust state, provenan
