actions, and audit trails to both parties. (Builds on the earlier mutual-tr=
ust and visibility basis.) 

2.
 The framework of claim 1 wherein the trust engine p=
enalizes critical violations and applies bonuses for verified compliance, a=
nd outputs a confidence measure that gates action scope. (Extends reversibl=
e scoring.) 

3.
 The framework of claim 1 wherein DIDs comprise at l=
east one of: did:web, did:key, did:ethr, or did:ion, and wherein the verifi=
able credential module conforms to W3C data models. (Adds DID/VC standardiz=
ation against your oracle/identity layer.) 

4.
 The framework of claim 1 further comprising a valid=
ator that performs signature verification, credential schema checks, DID do=
cument resolution, and revocation status verification prior to any trust-ga=
ted action.

5.
 The framework of claim 1 wherein trust events are l=
ogged as cryptographically bound records that are inspectable, reversible b=
y consent, and visualized as a graph of decisions, feedback, and trust upda=
tes. (Consistent with prior graph UI.) 

6.
 The framework of claim 1 wherein issuance and verif=
ication of credentials enable federated trust portability across agent netw=
orks, supporting reputation markets and compliance reporting.

7.
 A method for initializing and maintaining the frame=
work of claim 1 comprising: (i) human submission of intent and boundaries, =
(ii) agent disclosure of capability and memory parameters, (iii) validator =
construction of a mutual trust gate upon DID/VC verification, and (iv) cont=
inuous recalibration of trust and permissions from feedback and outcomes. (=
Anchored to the earlier trust-gate method, now with crypto checks.) 

8.
 The method of claim 7 wherein revocation or lapse o=
f verifiable credentials automatically reduces agent autonomy to a safe bas=
eline until re-verification completes.

9.
 The method of claim 7 wherein the visibility interf=
ace renders a two-way identity proof graph and handshake sequence to both p=
arties. (Explicitly ties to your diagrams.) 

10.
 A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing =
instructions which, when executed, implement the framework of claim 1, incl=
uding trust score computation with temporal decay, confidence interval esti=
mation, and policy actuation.
