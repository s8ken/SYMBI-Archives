 (including accelerator path)

A. Fast feedback loop (2=E2=80=933 founder-hours total):

Send 2-page overview + FIG.1/FIG=
.2 to 5 enterprise CISOs/Chief Risk & Compliance contacts for hallway f=
eedback on DID/VC requirements and auditability.

Run a 30-minute validation call =
per contact; capture objections specifically around revocation/resolution l=
atency and CI thresholds.

B. Accelerator: Fetch.ai Innovation Lab (plus 2 others):

Position as 
infrastructure enabling verifiable autonomy for age=

 (DID/VC + trust scoring; portable reputation; compliance=
 dashboards).

Application bullets to highlight=
: (i) first-mover DID/VC trust orchestration; (ii) enterprise compliance ho=
