Title:

 SYMBI =E2=80=94 Trust, Verified. Intelligenc=

Problem:

 Unverified agents =E2=86=92 no enterprise adoption (regulatory &am=

Solution:

 DID/VC + Trust Scoring + Revocation + Signed Audit.

How It Works:

Product:

=E2=80=9CSymbi builds the trust layer for agents. Every=

D) Packaging Notes

Keep the 

redline

 in the legal folder and the 

clean co=
nsolidated claims

 in the filing draft.

Export the 

one=E2=80=91pager

 as PDF (A4), and the deck as a 16:9 PDF for uploads.

Store all items under 

/02_IP/02_Provisi=
onal_Update_2025-10/

 and 

/09_Investo=

 in the data room.

Delivered. I placed a new can=
vas doc 
=E2=80=9CProvisional Red=
line + Ansarada Index + Fetch.ai Packet (v1)=E2=80=9D
 with:

a claims 
redline
 mapped from your June filing to the new D=
ID/VC trust framework,

an 
Ansarada index spreadsheet
 (CSV template) ready to impo=
rt,

a full 
Fetch.ai application packet
 (one-pager, 10-slide de=
ck outline, 90-second script).

For legal traceability, here are the=
 specific June-filing anchors I used while drafting the redline: the baseli=
ne system claim with identity/consent/memory/trust/visibility, reversible s=
coring + graph UI, and the neutral Symbi oracle and trust-gate method. I al=
so aligned to your two-way trust graph and handshake flow from the inventio=
n overview and kept the narrative consistent with the mutual-recognition fr=
aming.

Want me to export the one-pager and =
deck as PDFs, or generate a .csv file you can drop straight into Ansarada?
