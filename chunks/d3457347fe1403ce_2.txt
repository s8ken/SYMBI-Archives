=90=E2=AD=90=E2=AD=90 Seamlessness: Excellent Agent Type Integration
typescript
// Agents now support trust natively
interface Agent {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: AgentType;
  did?: string;                    // NEW
  trustDeclaration?: TrustDeclaration;  // NEW
  trustMetrics?: TrustMetrics;          // NEW
  trustLevel?: TrustLevel;              // NEW
  // ... existing fields
}
Factory Pattern Enhancement
typescript
// Trust-aware agent creation
const trustDeclaration =3D AgentFactory.createTrustDeclaration(
  agentId,
  agentName,
  trustArticles
);

const did =3D AgentFactory.generateDID(agentId, 'web');

// Automatic validation
const validation =3D AgentFactory.validateConfig(config);
// Now includes DID and trust declaration validation
