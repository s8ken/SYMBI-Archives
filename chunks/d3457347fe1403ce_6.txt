Day 1=E2=80=932

Lock

 generate official test vectors.

Draft 
Controls Matrix
 (EU AI Act, SOC 2, ISO 42001/270=

Day 3=E2=80=936

Implement signature verification +=
 DID resolution + revocation; wire KMS adapters.

Add decision audit log with signed=
 records.

Day 7=E2=80=939

Property-based + fuzz testing; loa=
d test resolution cache.

Close JWT hardening; rotate keys.

Day 10=E2=80=9312

Build minimal 
Trust Dashboard
 (read-only) with KPIs =
above.

Write 
Pilot Runbook
 (enroll issuer, issue VC, verify, =
revoke).

Day 13=E2=80=9314
