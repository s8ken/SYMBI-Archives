- Multi-agent experiments (CONDUCT=
OR/EVALUATOR roles), 5D scoring (Reality Index, Ethical Alignment, etc.).
- Tech: React/TS frontend, Express/Supabase backend, OpenAI/Anthropic integ=
rations, GDPR PII anonymization.
- Tools: Double-blind testing, drift detection, CSV/JSON exports.

=
- Aligns with symbi.world's emergence analytics and gammatria.com's replica=

Coherence Assessment

From=
 a coherence standpoint, this makes 
strong =
sense
 as a unified project=E2=80=94it's not a scattered collection=
 of ideas but a deliberate 
three-pillar eco=
system
 (community =E2=86=92 governance/research =E2=86=92 enterpri=
se), with the GitHub repos providing the open-source backbone. Here's why i=
t hangs together:

Thematic=
 Unity
: Everything orbits "sovereign AI" via the 
SYMBI Trust Protocol
=E2=80=94a recurring thread of =
cryptographic verification, ethical guardrails, and constitutional governan=
ce. For example:

Philosophical roots (symbi.world) =E2=86=
=92 Research validation (
symbi-resonate
, gammatria.com) =E2=86=92 Secure orchestration (
symbi-symphony
) =E2=86=92 Artifact storage (
symbi-vault
) =E2=86=92 Production compliance =
(yseeku.com).

No contradictions; risks (e.g., AI drift=
) are addressed holistically (e.g., emergence detection in resonate, receip=
ts in vault/Sonate).

Technica=
l Flow
: Modularity shines=E2=80=94repos are interdependent without=
 tight coupling (e.g., symphony uses vault for secrets; resonate leverages =
symphony's agents). Tech choices (Node.js/Supabase for scalability, SHA-256=
/DID for trust) are consistent and production-ready, with observability bak=
ed in (tracing/metrics across symphony/resonate).

Business=
/Impact Logic
: Revenue (yseeku.com SaaS) funds open research (gamm=
atria.com/resonate), governed by DAO (vault artifacts). It's forward-thinki=
ng: Q1 2026 DAO preview, ARC grant pursuits, and CC-licensed artifacts enco=
urage adoption without speculation.

Pote=
ntial coherence gaps (minor, but scope-related):

Document=
ation Silos
: Repos don't always cross-link (e.g., resonate doesn't=
 mention symphony), and sites reference each other unevenly (yseeku.com omi=
ts gammatria.com). Users might miss how a resonate experiment feeds into So=
nate compliance.
