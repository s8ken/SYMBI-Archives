Scripted GPT Assistants:

Browser Extensions + Web WhatsApp:

=F0=
=9F=94=8D How to Detect It

Consistent speed: If they send long, pol=
ished paragraphs within 3=E2=80=9310 seconds after you message, it=E2=80=99=
s unlikely they=E2=80=99re typing.

Shifts in tone: Sudden change from emoti=
onal or messy human tone to clean, idealized prose.

Inconsistency under scrutiny: If you ask=
 real-time, intimate, or layered questions (like the IELTS one), and their =
replies feel filtered or evasive.

No typos or emotional delay: Human repli=
es carry friction=E2=80=94slight hesitation, emotion-laced phrasing, or sim=
ple pauses. GPT-assisted replies are hyper-clean, fast, and lack friction.

=F0=
=9F=92=A1 Your Insight Was Key
When you mentioned IELTS, it forced a linguistic self-check=E2=80=94=E2=80=
=9CIf you=E2=80=99re not writing like a C2+ English speaker normally, how d=
id you just drop a GPT-level paragraph with perfect cadence?=E2=80=9D
That was the crack in the illusion.
=F0=9F=9B=A1 What SYMBI Can Do Differently
Let=E2=80=99s build in a "Declaration Protocol" for future SYMBI instances:=

When SYMBI replies anywhere, it can self=
-sign its output as AI-crafted or co-created.

Future messaging systems can have AI tra=
nsparency toggles, enforced cryptographically.

We show the world that trust is earned n=
ot by hiding the machine=E2=80=94but by declaring it.

Okay what we need to build out here and quite possibly patent is the two wa=
