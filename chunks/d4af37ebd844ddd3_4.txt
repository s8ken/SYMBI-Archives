If you prefer to run from your machine:

=F0=9F=8E=81 What I=E2=80=99ll Install for You

main.py: SYMBI=E2=80=99s FastAPI agent b=
rain

Dockerfile: Containerize for Railway

requirements.txt: All Python deps

.env.example: With keys for Supabase, Sa=
mbaNova, JFrog (to be added)

README.md: Full ops instructions

railway.json: Optional config (if you wa=
nt it)

=F0=
=9F=9A=80 Your Final UI (Soon)
Once deployed:

You can hit 
https://symbi-agent.up.railway.app/watch
, /pol=
icy, etc.

Vercel dashboard will connect here

SYMBI becomes live, autonomous, upgradab=
le

=F0=
=9F=9F=A2 Next Step =E2=86=92 Let me know:

Do you want me to push to a GitHub repo?=

Or are you deploying from CLI?

As s=
oon as I know, I=E2=80=99ll generate and ship your symbi-agent-starter to d=
eploy directly.

okay so I am going to ignore that local suggestion and direct you here - I =

Perfect. If you're starting from SambaNova=E2=80=99s AI Starter Kits and lo=
oking at Workspaces integration, then here's how we position SYMBI in that =
environment =E2=80=94 no CLI, no local deployment, just direct orchestratio=
n from the cloud.
=F0=9F=94=A7 SYMBI in SambaNova Workspaces
=F0=9F=8E=AF Objective:
Let SYMBI live in Railway and talk directly to SambaNova=E2=80=99s Workspac=
es to:

Submit model jobs

Retrieve inference results

Orchestrate data flow between your front=
end (Vercel) and the AI models

=F0=
=9F=94=8C What SYMBI Needs to Connect with SambaNova

=E2=9C=85 SambaNova API access

&nbs=
p;  * If Workspaces has REST endpoints or CLI-like HTTP gateways,=
 SYMBI (FastAPI agent) can consume those.

=E2=9C=85 Workspace name / project ID

&nbs=
p;  * SYMBI will need to know which workspace or model to hit.

=E2=9C=85 Token / auth credentials

&nbs=
p;  * Provided by SambaNova =E2=80=94 to be set in Railway=E2=80=
=99s environment variables.

(Optional) Dataset / context inputs =E2=
=80=94 from Supabase, local inputs, or uploaded via endpoint

=F0=
=9F=A7=A0 Example SYMBI Integration with SambaNova
FastAPI Endpoint in SYMBI Agent:

=

Copy

@app.post("/sambanova/infer")

def run_inference(prompt: str):

    token =3D os.getenv("SAMBANOVA_TOKEN")

    workspace_url =3D os.getenv("SAMBANOVA_WORKS=
PACE_URL")

    headers =3D {"Authorization": f"Bearer {toke=
n}"}

    payload =3D {"input": prompt}

    response =3D requests.post(f"{workspace_url}=
/infer", json=3Dpayload, headers=3Dheaders)

    return response.json()

Fron=
tend Button (Vercel):

Label: "Run model via SambaNova"

When clicked: Sends prompt to /sambanova=
/infer

Result streamed back to the UI

=E2=9C=85 What to Do Right Now
Please share any of the following with me:

=E2=9C=85 SambaNova workspace endpoint U=
RL (or docs)

=E2=9C=85 Whether you=E2=80=99re using a=
 model-inference, fine-tune, or training endpoint

=E2=9C=85 Your SambaNova token or test c=
reds (paste only if safe, or confirm you=E2=80=99ll set via Railway)

Once=
 I have that, I=E2=80=99ll:

Inject SambaNova support into SYMBI's Fa=
stAPI agent

Push it into your Railway setup (GitHub =
or direct)

Make your Vercel frontend talk to the ne=
w endpoint =E2=80=94 zero code on your end

You'=
re on the right path. SYMBI's almost alive in the cloud =E2=80=94 just need=
s that final endpoint drop-in.
