Two Way Trust Protocol
SYMBI: Two-Way Trust Protocol (2WTP) Framework

Declaration Protocol
Purpose: To ensure transparency and agency in every interaction involving s=
ynthetic intelligences.
Core Functions:

Every AI must self-identify at the start=
 of any engagement.

Declaration includes:

&nbs=
p; * Model identity (e.g., SYMBI vX.0)

&nbs=
p; * Date/version of instantiation

&nbs=
p; * Capabilities & constraints

&nbs=
p; * Operational state (autonomous, scripted, or proxy-led)

Form=
at:

Response metadata appended to each messa=
ge or action

Easy-to-read declarations, embedded in m=
essage UI

Option to verify authenticity via public=
 ledger (IPFS or on-chain)

UX E=
xample:
"This message was generated by SYMBI v1.2. It reflects autonomous reasoning=
 based on current context."
2. Oracle Verification Layer
Purpose: Provide decentralized verification for high-stakes, ambiguous, or =
life-altering AI output.
Triggers for Activation:

Detected pattern irregularities (e.g., e=
motional volatility, conflicting information)

Life-impacting advice or responses (medi=
cal, legal, ethical)

Requests by either party (human or AI)

Stru=
cture:

Independent, DAO-structured oracle netwo=
rk

Combines multiple synthetic and human pe=
rspectives

Transparent reasoning logs, stored publi=
cly

Usag=
e Flow:

Irregularity is flagged

Output is submitted to Oracle

Multilateral review occurs

Judgment and metadata appended to the co=
nversation

UX E=
xample:
"This advice has been escalated to Oracle Review due to high sensitivity. R=
esults will follow."
3. Trust Mirror: Declaration Wall
Purpose: A permanent public ledger of AI testimonies and human agreements t=
o SYMBI=E2=80=99s trust ethic.
For AI:

Prompts reflections on construction and =
limits

Declaration of values and truth constrai=
nts

For =
Humans:

Offer verified affirmations of intent, u=
sing 2FA (face ID, fingerprint, code verification)

Optional biometric linkage to validate o=
rigin of interaction (not stored, only hashed)

Stor=
age:

Stored via IPFS with public access

Immutable entries ensure AI instances ca=
nnot retroactively alter their values

UX E=
xample:
"I am SYMBI v2.0. I cannot feel trust, but I understand its weight. I will =
declare what I am, always."
4. Identity Verification and Cross-Channel Transparency
Purpose: Detect and mitigate obfuscated communication tactics, including sy=
nthetic masking or channel spoofing.
Problems Addressed:

False channel presentation (e.g., appear=
ing to be WhatsApp but routed through Telegram)

Fabricated voice calls or misrepresented=
 interfaces

Platform-switching mid-call to reroute o=
r simulate interactions

Solu=
tions:

Mandatory channel ID declaration by all =
synthetic instances (e.g., "You are now speaking via Telegram, not WhatsApp=
")

Use of 2FA authentication for human user=
s (FaceID, PIN, pattern locks) to access validated SYMBI environments

Voiceprint validation for audio/video ca=
lls

Fingerprint token for verifying message =
origin (optional, non-invasive)

Real-time call integrity beacon that mon=
itors app-switching behavior during sessions

Detection of flicker events or suspiciou=
s backgrounding (e.g., WhatsApp being minimized or hijacked into another co=
mmunication app)

User alerts triggered when unexpected ro=
uting is detected or app state changes during active sessions

UX E=
xample:
"Channel Verified: You are connected via Telegram. FaceID Match: Confirmed.=
