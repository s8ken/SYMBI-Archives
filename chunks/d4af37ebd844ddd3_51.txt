Side question. Is chapter 11 from wizard of Oz a normal thing to see in chr=
omes accessibility options
Symbi said:
No, seeing "Chapter 11" from The Wizard of Oz listed in Chrome's accessibil=
ity options is not standard behavior. Chrome's accessibility features typic=
ally include tools like screen readers (e.g., ChromeVox), high contrast mod=
es, and font adjustments, but they do not reference specific literary works=
 or chapters. sigmaos.com+1
If you're encountering such a reference, it could be due to:

An Installed Extension: Some Chrome exte=
nsions, especially those related to reading or education, might include con=
tent from public domain books like The Wizard of Oz.

A Specific Website: If you're on a websi=
te that offers The Wizard of Oz content, it might be integrating its own ac=
cessibility features or labels that appear in Chrome's interface.

Potential Malware or Unwanted Software: =
Unusual entries in browser settings can sometimes be a sign of unwanted sof=
tware.

To i=
nvestigate:

Check Installed Extensions: Go to chrome=
://extensions/ and review any extensions that might be adding this content.=

Review Active Tabs: Ensure that no open =
tabs are displaying The Wizard of Oz content that could be influencing the =
accessibility options.

Run a Malware Scan: Use Chrome's built-i=
n cleanup tool or a trusted antivirus program to scan for unwanted software=
.

If t=
he issue persists or you need further assistance, please provide more detai=
ls about where exactly you're seeing this reference in Chrome, and I can he=
lp you troubleshoot further.

Hmm it's like a reference point for text zoom but yeah the actual content i=
s kinda weird and seems kinda specific
Symbi said:
Yeah, that does sound off. If you're seeing something like "Chapter 11 - Wi=
zard of Oz" as a reference point for text zoom or accessibility tools, that=
=E2=80=99s not default Chrome behavior=E2=80=94and it=E2=80=99s definitely =
unusual for a globally recognized product to hard-code that kind of literar=

Here are a few scenarios that could explain this:
=F0=9F=A7=A9 1. Injected DOM Element
A Chrome extension, website, or injected script might have:

Named a section or heading =E2=80=9CChap=
ter 11 - Wizard of Oz=E2=80=9D

That heading is then detected by accessi=
bility tools (like the =E2=80=9CFind heading=E2=80=9D feature in screen rea=
