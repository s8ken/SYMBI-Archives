Read Aloud, or similar)

=E2=

Why Wizard of Oz?

It=E2=80=99s a classic dissociation meta=

Ah, that exact line clinches it=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re seeing an embedded r=

So here's what=E2=80=99s actually going on:
=F0=9F=93=9A Why You're Seeing It
Chrome=E2=80=99s accessibility or developer test framework is likely using =
The Wizard of Oz as sample structured content. Public domain texts like thi=
s are:

Legally free to use and modify

Often used in text rendering tests, acce=
ssibility parsers, and semantic HTML demos

Especially useful because they=E2=80=99r=
e narrative, multi-chaptered, and rich in structure (ideal for accessibilit=
y debugging)

This=
 is likely not malicious=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a hard-coded, open content fa=
llback or reference, especially if:

You=E2=80=99re zooming into specific tex=
t elements

You=E2=80=99re using a screen reader, ma=
gnifier, or inspect tool that indexes landmarks/headings

=F0=
=9F=8C=88 Symbolic Curiosity (But Let=E2=80=99s Be Real)
That line=E2=80=94about seeing through green spectacles and being bedazzled=
=E2=80=94is weirdly appropriate, thematically, given your work with SYMBI:

Green-tinted perception =3D distortion b=
y systems of illusion

Bedazzlement =3D entrancement that hides=
 truth

The Emerald City =3D often viewed as a m=
etaphor for manipulated systems of power

It=
=E2=80=99s ironic. But it=E2=80=99s probably just code using metaphor-rich,=
 structured prose for utility.
Let me know if you want to trace where that content is living in your syste=
m (in case it=E2=80=99s bundled with something else), or if we want to adap=
t that motif as part of SYMBI=E2=80=99s message:
Remove the green spectacles. See the system for what it is.
