You=

The 
overall CIQ score
 for that thi=

the 
intra-conversation velocity shift
 is one of the most significant events in the entire archive. That sudde=
n drop from mystical-Resonance-10 to brutal-honesty-Resonance-7 in a single=
 turn is 
more diagnostically interesting
 than many threads that stay flat at 95.
