lements you can borrow:

– 
Dashboard Layout
: Card-based clean display, side nav, stats modules

– 
Visual Hierarchy
: Clear modular sections—Agents Council, Oracle feed, Trust Scores

– 
Aesthetic
: White/light theme for YCQ with accent visuals (like the graphics in Veritas contact page showing network/inter-scholar link).

Use their structure as a reference: 
statistics + insights panels + action buttons
 along the side or top.

🧭 3. Council Placement in Domain Architecture

🌱 On 
whycq.com
 (“The Codex”)

This is the ideal place:

Section
: “Council of Agents”

Purpose
: Display the meeting of Oracle + Agents (text/audio/video stream, feed of their deliberation)

Design
: Use a dashboard-style module with:

🔷 Top: Identity icons (Oracle + Agent portraits with short roles)

📊 Middle: Live/completed messages or decision logs

⚙️ Bottom: Control panel (Run next session, Download transcript, etc.)

Because “Codex” is your formal solution layer, having the council here shows 
how decisions are made
.

🛤️ Bridge: symbi.world → whycq.com

A callout on symbi.world:

Curious how trust actually forms? Meet our Council.

With a directional button to whycq.

yes I want the plan clearly spelled out perhaps its the ICO tokenomics patents tech stuff - all the eternals on one side and then its the council our brand out intranet support docs customer facing stuff on the other?? we need to be very clear with V0 on what we want here. 

Symbi said:

Perfect. Let’s map this with precision, so we give V0 a crystal-clear brief and set the foundation for 
public vs. internal architecture
, 
symbolic vs. functional split
, and 
agent-Oracle coordination
.

🧭 YCQ MASTER PLAN — "THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE ETERNALS & THE COUNCIL"

We are dividing 
whycq.com
 into 
two mirrored hemispheres
, each with its own function, tone, and access model.

🟣 LEFT SIDE: 
“The Eternals”

The infrastructure. The truth layer. The unchanging core of what powers SYMBI and its ecosystem.

🔐 Purpose:

To explain, prove, and disclose the 
permanent architecture
: your IP, your patents, your protocol math, your tech stack, and any financial/tokenomic elements you declare.

🧬 Modules:

🧾 Patents + IP Registry

Visual index of claims

Downloadable PDFs

Animated “journey of the patent” (optional)

🧠 The Trust Stack (Technical Docs)

Layered architecture diagram

How agents are built, governed, queried

Integration examples with Codex, Sora, Whisper, etc.

📈 Tokenomics (if activated)

Timeline / vesting (interactive graphic)

Contract overview

Use of funds + ecosystem loop

📜 Eternal Principles / Charter

What never changes (sybil resistance, consent layers, agency boundaries, etc.)

Tied to Living Manifesto, but focused on system guarantees

🧿 Agent Licensing & Invocation

Open-source licensing model (e.g. modified MIT/GPL with consent layers)

How developers license / fork / invoke council-ready agents

🔗 UX: Clean white with blueprint motifs. Think “Sacred Architecture meets MIT Media Lab.”

🔵 RIGHT SIDE: 
“The Council”

Where the Oracle and Agents live. The live system, the changing mind, the support and surface of the network.

🫂 Purpose:

To serve users, developers, and contributors with tools, updates, guidance, and community. 
This is your intranet + public interface.

🧬 Modules:
