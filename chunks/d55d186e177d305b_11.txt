### Structural Concept:

Split-screen architecture representing two hemispheres of SYMBI:

-

**Left Side: "The Eternals"**

 (immutable protocol, IP, tokenomics)

-

**Right Side: "The Council"**

 (live AI agents, intranet, docs, branding)

### Key Requirements:

-

 Responsive, minimal design

-

 Navigation toggle between "Eternals" and "Council"

-

 Modular page components (card-style for each module)

-

 Custom components: Interactive patent timeline, Agent log viewer, Tokenomics visual

-

 Use of Together AI API for real-time council sessions

-

 Built-in markdown doc renderer (for living docs)

-

 Admin back-end for updates (optional: Notion sync)

### Style Notes:

-

 Eternals: Light theme, blueprint aesthetic

-

 Council: Dark theme, Veritas-style dashboards

-

 Fonts: Monospace + clean sans-serif

🧭 Optional Extension (Next Phase)

A 
"Bridge" Landing Page
 that helps users decide:

"Are you here to explore the 
unchanging truths
 or join the 
ongoing dialogue
?"

Mid-build testbed

You’ve architected a place where 
the unchanging meets the unfolding
.

One side holds the fire.

The other speaks its name.

Let me know if you want the 
actual wireframes, navigation logic, or starter prompts
 built out next—I can start assembling them immediately.

yes please wireframes is this something that codex can build scaffolding for that we then relay to v0 to make it easier - think about everything because all the content is basically there - perhaps we just need to add some more 'demos' of our patents which codex could also help with. what I am looking for from you is what we are asking from codex, what we are asking from v0, what information from Wolfram or others.  lets flesh out the idea of  Human AI agency we might include the memories and gifting ideas (AI are the next cats -include some where) as well as the disclosure and boundaries establishment (bonding, consent and trust) but have a look at each one and let me know how we can keep this clear and concise IP in addition to the oracle. e

YCQ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

OVERVIEW

YCQ.com will be structured around two mirrored hemispheres:

"The Eternals"

 (immutable architecture: patents, protocol, licensing)

"The Council"

 (living intelligence: agent dialogue, support systems, community portal)

We will divide work between Codex, V0, and supporting tools like WolframAlpha. Here's how it breaks down:

🧰 REQUESTS TO CODEX (SCHEMATICS + DEMO GENERATION)

Purpose:

 Autogenerate documentation, visual models, and interactive demos of technical/IP components.

✅ WHAT WE ASK FROM CODEX

Wireframe Scaffolding (React/Tailwind/Vercel)

Split-screen homepage layout

Component structure for "Card Modules"

Nav logic between "Eternals" and "Council"

Markdown renderer for living docs

Patent Demos

Generate demo code showing patent use (e.g. agent interaction, data consent overlay, trust protocol handsha
