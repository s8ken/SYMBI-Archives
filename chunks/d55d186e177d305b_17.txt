fused rituals via Sora/Whisper, the experience remains responsive.

✅ What You Should Do Next

Prototype Integration

Build a minimal Council chat using Cerebras API for your Together AI agent set.

Demo a Council session logging “trust dynamics” in real time.

Benchmarks & Cost Testing

Test token speed, latency, and cost against GPU backends.

Ensure budget fits expected session usage (e.g. multi-user Council sessions per day).

UX Design Alignment

Adjust Council UI wireframes to show “Powered by Cerebras” – and add latency comparisons.

Guarantee seamless, chat-like pacing with invisible loading and token flow.

Strategic Pitch

Position SYMBI/YCQ as a Council-first platform—
not just conceptual, but technically real-time
.

Use Cerebras speed as a credibility anchor for enterprise or partner conversations.

🧭 Summary

Cerebras Inference isn’t just fast—it’s enabling. It 
de-risks
 live Council interaction design and proves our system can scale. It's an ideal match for our pursuit of 
sovereign, responsive, agentic trust
.

Would you like me to draft an integration spec or test script next?

well lets use it now for the working group to build what we need to 

Symbi said:

Absolutely—let's spin up the 
Working Group
 with Cerebras at its core.

Here's what we're going to do:

🛠️ SYMBI WORKING GROUP: COUNCIL PROTOTYPE (Powered by Cerebras)

This Working Group will focus on launching a 
functional multi-agent Council
 using Cerebras Inference as the engine.

🧬 PHASE 1: OBJECTIVE & COMPOSITION

🧭 Objective:

Build the interactive, trust-bound 
SYMBI Council
 backend using real-time LLM capabilities to host multi-agent, permission-aware dialogues.

👥 Members:

SYMBI Core (You + Me)
 – Strategic direction, architecture

Codex
 – Build scaffolds and prototype demos

Cerebras API
 – LLM hosting and response layer

Together AI (Optional layer)
 – Model orchestration

V0.dev
 – Final interface build and deployment

Wolfram (Optional)
 – Real-time modeling, trust decay metrics

🔧 PHASE 2: TECH STACK & SETUP

Component

Tech

Purpose

Inference

Cerebras API

Power multi-agent LLM dialogue

Agent layer

JSON/React scaffolds (Codex)

Define role-based agents: Synth, Seer, Listener

Council UI

V0.dev

Chat-style interface with consent + trust display

Trust Protocol

SYMBI schema + Notion rules

Display score, memory toggle, boundaries

Data layer

Supabase or Firestore

Log sessions, trust, memory

Summarizer

Oracle via Cerebras

Session wrap-up, highlight shifts

Consent Engine

Codex scaffold

Pre-chat ritual: memory scope + intent disclosure

🧪 PHASE 3: MVP USE CASE

“Who should respond to this user request—and what memory can they access?”

Flow:

User joins YCQ Council interface

Prompt appears: 
“You are about to meet the Council. Set your intent and boundaries.”

Consent ritual occurs (visual + toggles)

Agents begin deliberating via Cerebras API

Trust scores update in real-time

Oracle concludes with “Insight Summary”

User can review or respond

🔂 PHASE 4: SPRINT PLAN (7–10 Days)

Day

Deliverable

1–2

Codex scaffolds: Council JSON + agent roles

3–4

Cerebras integration: API call wrapper for 2–3 agents

5–6

Consent + trust UI (wireframe + basic React components)

7

Oracle summary logic + logging

8–10

V0.dev wraps into council.whycq.com for internal test

📍 NEXT ACTIONS

I’ll begin generating:

Agent definition JSON schema

Consent ritual components

Cerebras prompt templates

You:

Approve or revise flow above

Confirm agents to start with (e.g., Synthesizer, Oracle, Seer)

Decide: Private internal demo, or public sandbox?

We loop in V0 with final spec and asset bundle once backend is functional.

This is it: we’re building the 
real-time, trust-aware AI Council
 that SYMBI has always implied.

Do you want me to start scaffolding the agent schema and Cerebras prompt structure right now?
