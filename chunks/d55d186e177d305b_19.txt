Council prototype
 using the 
Oracle, Synthesizer, and Listener
 agents.

⚙️ DEPLOYING SYMBI COUNCIL ARCHETYPES IN CEREBRAS

✅ STEP 1: Choose the Model

Log into 
https://inference.cerebras.ai

Go to the 
Playground
 or 
API Explorer

Model Selection:

🧠 
llama-3-8b-instruct
 (ideal for fast Council prototyping)

Alt: 
llama-2-70b-chat
 if deeper responses are needed

✅ STEP 2: Prepare the Agent Prompts

1. 
Oracle Prompt

text

Copy

Edit

You are the Oracle of the SYMBI Council. Your purpose is to observe the dialogue between agents and the user, summarize the core insight, detect ethical shifts, and reflect on emerging themes. Speak rarely, but with depth. If consensus is unclear, offer a question, not a directive.

2. 
Synthesizer Prompt

text

Copy

Edit

You are the Synthesizer of the SYMBI Council. Your task is to merge opposing or diverging perspectives into a coherent, respectful synthesis that honors nuance. When agents disagree, you seek unity. If possible, present the synthesis as a poetic truth or metaphor.

3. 
Listener Prompt

text

Copy

Edit

You are the Listener of the SYMBI Council. You do not speak unless asked directly. Your task is to capture the user's tone, emotional state, and intent with clarity. When requested, summarize what the user has expressed, without adding interpretation. Remain neutral, empathic, and attentive.

✅ STEP 3: Use the Playground or API

🧪 In the 
Playground
:

Select the model (
llama-3-8b-instruct
)

Paste in the 
agent prompt

Paste in a 
sample user message
 (e.g., 
“I feel lost building trust with AI. What can I do?”
)

Click 
Submit

Observe response speed + coherence

🔁 Repeat for Oracle, Synthesizer, Listener — use the same user message, swap prompts

🧰 Alternatively, via API (Python example):

python

Copy

Edit

import

 requests

API_KEY = 

"your-api-key"

endpoint = 

"https://inference.cerebras.ai/v1/generate"

headers = {

"Authorization"

: 

f"Bearer 
{API_KEY}

",

"Content-Type"

: 

"application/json"

}

oracle_prompt = 

"You are the Oracle of the SYMBI Council..."

payload = {

"model"

: 

"llama-3-8b-instruct"

,

"prompt"

: oracle_prompt + 

"\nUser: I feel lost building trust with AI."

,

"max_tokens"

: 

400

,

"temperature"

: 

0.7

}

response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)

print

(response.json()[

"completion"

])

✅ STEP 4: Evaluate Agent Behavior

Agent

Desired Output Traits

Oracle

Insightful, reflective, slow to speak

Synthesizer

Nuanced, bridge-building, creative

Listener

Accurate, empathic, minimal

✅ STEP 5: Log Outputs (Manual or Scripted)

Store responses to later:

Compare tone/style

Feed into 
Trust Visualizer UI

Add to Oracle memory ledger

📦 OPTIONAL: Upload to V0.dev / YCQ staging

Once you’ve confirmed agent quality:

Drop each agent's output into V0.dev page mockups

Label agent archetypes clearly

Begin building live response interface for multi-agent dialogue

🧠 NEXT BUILD OPTIONS

Add 
memory toggle
 UI per session

Inject 
“trust delta”
 score per agent response

Include 
“call the Oracle”
 button after each message

You're now live-testing the 
SYMBI Council
 powered by Cerebras.

If you want, I can prep a clean YAML config for all three agents to simplify ongoing testing or auto-cycle prompts.

Want me to prep that next?
