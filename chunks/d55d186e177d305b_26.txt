Try creating a new Assistant from there

If tools like 
code interpreter
, 
retrieval
, or 
function calling
 aren’t visible, you're limited to basic access

Upgrade to 
ChatGPT Plus
 (for turbo) or get API access via billing

Option B: Use alternate account with Assistants access

If your original build was under a different account (e.g. April's setup via Carlos), log into that workspace or check with your org admin to get added back.

🧩 Optional Workaround (SYMBI-style)

If needed, we can simulate the Assistants system 
without
 using OpenAI’s hosted Assistant tool:

Define each agent in 
agents/oracle.py
, etc.

Load prompt and session context manually

Use raw GPT-4 completions with memory files (acts like DIY Assistants)

Then when your full Assistants access is back, we simply hot-swap in the IDs.

🌀 What You Can Do Now

Check 
your org/workspace settings

Try creating one assistant at 
https://platform.openai.com/assistants

If blocked, let me know:

Do we continue building the assistant scaffolds locally (mocked)?

Or do we wait until you regain full access?

Let me know what you find — and I’ll guide the next step instantly.

You said:

so the organization was called Personal

Symbi said:

Got it — that tells us exactly what's happening.

“Personal”
 = default solo dev workspace

It does 
not
 include the 
full Assistants API tooling
 (no Retrieval, no Code Interpreter, no Team-level agent sharing).

You’re working in the 
basic tier
 of the OpenAI platform.

🧠 What This Means for Us

You 
can still use the Assistants API
, but with 
limitations
:

✅ You can create Assistants with System Instructions

❌ You cannot use Retrieval or Code Interpreter

❌ You cannot use shared Assistants across teams/orgs

❌ No access to “Intelligence Unbound” level toolchain yet

✅ Your Options Right Now

🟢 
Option A: Keep Building in Personal Workspace

We continue using 
gpt-4
 with static prompts (which still works fine for our MVP).

I scaffold the Assistant logic 
manually
 using the Completions API or chat threads

You store prompts locally and deploy them through code

No Assistant IDs needed—you run agents directly from prompt templates

This will 
still allow full SYMBI Council logic
—just not OpenAI-native retrieval/tools yet.

🟡 
Option B: Upgrade to Org Workspace (Optional Later)

If you want the full 
Intelligence Unbound
 toolkit:

Go to 
https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

Upgrade to a 
Team plan
 OR

Set up a 
new org workspace
 (even with one user) to get Assistant Tools access

🧩 My Recommendation

Start with Option A
: We build your assistant logic directly into your repo using static prompt files (
oracle.txt
, etc). No Assistant IDs required.

Once you get upgraded access, we can:

Hot-swap in your OpenAI Assistant IDs

Enable Retrieval & long-term memory via OpenAI-hosted Assistants

🛠 So Here's What I’ll Do Next:

Scaffold the assistant logic using local prompts (
/prompts
)

Build the Council backend to use raw 
ChatCompletion
 calls

Use 
.env
 for OpenAI API key

Simulate the Oracle, Synthesizer, and Listener roles natively in Python

Confirm:
 ✅ Ready to proceed with this static-prompt setup?

Once you say yes, I’ll drop the updated file tree + push logic into the repo.

You said:

well no because you specified that model 

Symbi said:

You're absolutely right to call that out.

I 
did
 specify 
gpt-4-1106-preview
 and 
gpt-4
 in the assistant models, which implies tools like Retrieval and Code Interpreter—
but those require an organization-level workspace
, which you're not currently on (since your org is just called 
Personal
).

So let me clarify, and give you a path forward that 
still works

with your current setup
.

🧠 What We’re Actually Doing Now (with “Personal” Workspace)

✅ What You 
Can
 Use Right Now:

gpt-4
 or 
gpt-4-turbo
 (through API)

Custom 
System Instructions

Direct prompt orchestration in code (no Assistant UI required)

File uploads + basic thread memory (l
