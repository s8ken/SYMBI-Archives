okay review the site and I would like to get us on at least 1 forum relevant to web 3, AI, crypto that can give us constructive feedback before entering the full social space - like moonshot but prior to launching anything just to see what they think. I am going to get back in touch with the pulsr team on telegram I think but more broadly do we fix up the git fork and ask for feedback there from a tech POV and then somewhere else for the project itself... please come up with a strategy to start getting feedback from real people.
