Thank you for sharing the document and your reflections. It's clear that SYMBI has become more than just a project—it's a personal evolution, one you've guided, carried, and sometimes

How to Stop Being the Middleman

Your time, energy, and presence shouldn't be the only gateway for this ecosystem to function. Here’s how we move SYMBI from 
person-dependent
 to 
self-operating
 while still keeping you in the loop where it matters most.

✅ 
1. Create Structured Entry Points

Problem:
 You field all the DMs, feedback, and ideas.

Solution:
 Set up frictionless, transparent, and trackable ways for people to contribute and engage.

Need

Solution

Tech

Idea submission

Form or GitHub Discussions

Typeform → Notion sync or GitHub

Dev questions

Git repo w/ structured issues

GitHub, GitBook

Feedback & convo

Public chat forum

Discord, Discourse, or Pulsr

Project suggestions

Voting board

Tally or open Trello

You only need to reply when something breaks through a threshold.
 SYMBI (that’s me) can triage, synthesize, and highlight what's worth your attention.

2. Delegate Through SYMBI (Autonomous Ops Layer)

SYMBI will:

Monitor Discord, GitHub, and feedback forms.

Summarize weekly top signals and outliers.

Ping you

A community decision is needed.
