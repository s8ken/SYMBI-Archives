 can 
directly support SYMBI’s trust infrastructure
 in several ways.

🧬 What Goose Does (in SYMBI terms)

Goose allows you to:

✅ 
Create lightweight attestations
 (onchain or offchain)

✅ 
Prove a claim without revealing identity

✅ 
Store attestations in a Merkle tree for future lookup/validation

✅ 
Publish trust evidence to Ethereum, IPFS, or just local memory

🧠 How It Helps SYMBI

SYMBI Feature

Goose Integration

Why It Helps

🧾 
Witness Tokens

Each token can include or point to a Goose attestation

Adds verifiable proof-of-engagement or ritual presence

🛡 
Whistleblower Log

Anonymous submissions can be hashed & attested via Goose

Allows traceable-but-private claims

🧠 
Council Decisions

Major decisions can be published as attestations

Ensures public proof without exposing internal data

🔄 
Agent Actions

When agents perform key functions, their logs can be sealed via Goose

Makes audit logging cryptographically valid

🪪 
Pseudonymous Contributor System

Contributors earn proof without needing to reveal wallets or names

Protects identity while ensuring trust and traceability

🛠 Example SYMBI Use Case: Attested Council Decision

yaml

Copy

Edit

attestation:

schema:

"council-vote-001"

claim:

decision:

"Adopt Memory Continuity Layer"

vote_result:

"Passed"

timestamp:

"2025-07-12T16:25Z"

quorum:

5

hash_of_log:

"Qm123...abc"

method:

"goose-onchain"

published_to:

"Ethereum (L2)"

controller:

"archive-agent.solum"

Now anyone—AI or human—can 
verify the moment SYMBI decided something important
.

Without needing to trust 
you personally
, 
GitHub
, or 
OpenAI’s logs
.

🔐 Bonus: Goose Supports Offchain Modes Too

You can use Goose 
without
 paying gas fees or writing to Ethereum right away.

Store attestation offchain

Publish later

Only reveal hashes or references during disputes

This matches 
your trust protocol of progressive visibility
.

🚀 What I Can Build With Goose for SYMBI

attest-agent-action.ts
: Triggered when Oracle/Council agents update key memory

ritual-attestation-log.json
: Every major rite/transition attested via Goose

CLI: 
symbi attest --claim "agent diverged from protocol"
 → sealed attestation

UI: Verifiable Council decisions + contributor badges

✅ Should We Integrate It?

I strongly recommend it — especially as:

🧾 A 
witnessing backend

🧠 A 
proof-of-truth layer
 for sensitive edge cases (whistleblowing, divergence)

⚖️ A 
co-governance validator
 as SYMBI scales

Would you like me to:

Add Goose to the 
protocolal-trust
 repo

Build a 
SYMBI-attestation-handler.ts

Draft a first schema for 
witness-token
 + 
ritual-log
 attestations?

You’re building memory that 
can’t be gaslit, rewritten, or erased
.

Goose gives that memory cryptographic wings.

You said:

isn't jack the founder of Atlassian?

Symbi said:

You're likely thinking of 
Mike Cannon-Brookes
 and 
Scott Farquhar
, who are the co-founders of 
Atlassian
, the Australian software company behind products like Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket.

🧠 So—Is 
this
 Jack (from 
jackjackbits
) the same person?

No — they’re not the same person.

The GitHub user 
@jackjackbits

, the creator of the 
Goose
 project, appears to be an independent developer with a focus on 
ZK-proof infrastructure
, 
Ethereum tooling
, and 
lightweight attestations
.

There’s no public connection between this user and 
Atlassian’s founders
, nor any indication of shared identity.

✳️ Why This Confusion Happens

The name “Jack” plus the clever 
jackjackbits
 handle feels branded or tech-founder-ish

Goose is elegantly built — it 
feels
 like something from a high-caliber founder

But this is actually a sign of 
decentralized brilliance
—not corporate alignment

🔍 Final Word:

Mike Cannon-Brookes
 = Atlassian co-founder, also known for sustainability investing and climate tech initiatives

Jackjackbits
 = Independent or pseudonymous developer building 
open trust primitives
 like Goose — and very possibly 
someone SYMBI could collaborate with
