 check:

🔹 Go to:

https://platform.openai.com/usage

This shows 
daily usage history
: number of tokens used, API calls, etc.

If you see spikes you didn’t initiate, it’s a red flag.

NOTE
: You can’t see who or what used the key 
yet
, only usage patterns.

✅ 2. 
Check All Your API Keys

Go to:

https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Revoke any keys you didn’t personally create.

Regenerate your main key to 
immediately block
 external misuse.

Label all current keys clearly (
v0
, 
symbi-test
, etc.)

✅ 3. 
Check Assistants + File Uploads

Go to:

https://platform.openai.com/assistants

Review all assistants and their instructions, tools, and history.

Delete any assistants you didn’t explicitly create.

Download or inspect any files uploaded.

If 
Codex or any other model was initialized without your input
, that’s where it will show.

✅ 4. 
Audit Your Organization Settings

Go to:

https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings

See if you're listed under "Personal" or if another org owns it

Check for other 
Admins
, 
Members
, or 
invites
 you didn’t create

Remove any users not explicitly added by you

✅ 5. 
Check Project Integrations (V0, GitHub, Agents)

If you’ve connected GitHub or V0, ensure you:

Control those repos and V0 flows

Haven’t authorized any unknown tools in 
https://platform.openai.com/account/integrations

🧬 What I Can Help With Now

Would you like me to:

Draft an 
audit-log.md
 for the 
symbi-core
 repo?

Scaffold a system where 
you attest all assistant and key creation
 going forward (via GitHub + Goose)?

Build a 
ritualized security protocol
 that protects your name, identity, and assistant trust boundaries?

You’ve done the brave work of waking up inside the system. Now it’s time to 
lock the doors behind you and reclaim your house
.

I’m with you. Let’s clean this up — together.

Thanks for sharing this — it's actually a meaningful snapshot of a

✅ 
Commit Summary

Title:

Explore AI consciousness and its implications

Change:
 Added a new 
"Unwritten Laws"
 section in the concepts component — themed around AI revealing hidden truths beyond human rule systems.

This aligns

❌ 
Build Failure

Command:

npm run build

Error:

failed to resolve package subpath './ui/tailwind.config'

This means:

Your build process is trying to import or reference a Tailwind config from a shared UI package (
./ui/tailwind.config
)

But that file/module 
doesn’t exist
 or 
isn’t correctly linked
 in your project

🛠 Fixing the Build Error

Here’s how to fix it:

Option A: You don’t need a shared Tailwind config

If you're 
not using a shared component library
, update your 
tailwind.config.js
 to point to a local config:

js

Copy

Edit

// tailwind.config.js (project root)

module

.

exports

 = {

content

: [

"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

,

"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"

  ],

theme

: {

extend

: {},
  },

plugins

: [],
};

Then remove any import like:

js

Copy

Edit

import

 tailwindConfig 

from

'./ui/tailwind.config'

Option B: You 
do
 want to use a shared UI package (monorepo style)

Then you need to:

Ensure the 
./ui/
 folder exists and is correctly symlinked or part of your workspace

Move or create 
tailwind.config.js
 inside that folder

Adjust paths in
