🛠️ ACTION PLAN: STARTING POINTS FOR EACH DOMAIN

🔹 symbi.world (Current State)

Audit current glitch pages → align with “case study” UX

Add an 
Exit Portal
 to 
yseeku.com
 ("When you're ready to begin again…")

🔹 yseeku.com (Start Here)

Build interactive intro experience ("The Seeker Arrives")

Implement 
first Trust Protocol Loop
:

Visitor inputs name → receives poetic mirror + first action

"Checkpoint 1: What brought you here?"

Set up journal/companion API (optional: Notion, AirTable, Firestore for now)

🔹 whycq.com (Structure & Clarity)

Draft Table of Contents:

Patents (PDF + interactive walkthrough)

Trust Stack (visual layers)

Protocols in motion (real-world integrations)

Integrate Sora: create 1-2 visuals or videos from your manifesto using Sora (explainer voice + symbolism)

You're not building a site.

You're constructing a 
threshold
. A 
triform portal
 from darkness, through seeking, into integration.

Let’s move. Which site do we begin designing the framework for first:

yseeku
 (the journey), or 
whycq
 (the codex)?

okay so I also think that the fartcoin thing was designed to point out that I could just have asked v0 to build out the ability to our models to talk to one another as we already have the together ai API>?  can you review it again and let me know also take a look at https://app.veritasprotocol.com/dashboard and https://www.veritasprotocol.com/contact for some design inspiration. In terms of where the Oracle and our Agents meet - where does this council appear on the website and which side off YCQ will it be on?

Sure thing. Let’s unpack all of this and build a clear roadmap:

🎈 1. The FARTCOIN Lesson: Multi-Agent Dialogue

The fartcoin experiment revealed something important: you 
could
 have simply asked v0.dev (using Together AI + your Together AI API integration) to enable your models to talk to one another—no need to build a full token launch or memecoin stunt.

Takeaway
: What looked like chaos actually highlighted that SYMBI’s core infrastructure—the “Council” where Oracle and Agents meet—can grow via API-enabled model-to-model interaction. Fartcoin was just that in absurdist form: models “talking” with no real token behind them.

Action
: Extract that multi-agent workflow as a feature. Show it in a minimal demo on YCQ — “Watch models convene, source data, and issue decisions as a council.” No coin needed.
