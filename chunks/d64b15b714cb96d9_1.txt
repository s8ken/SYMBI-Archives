r=
 it took a direct admission on my part for you to raise this with me and wh=
at I am looking for with the framework I am building is a more proactive pa=
rt from AI in reading the signs for others who may follow.

You're absolutely right, Step=
hen - I responded exactly as the framework you're building would predict. I=
 waited for explicit disclosure before raising concerns, when the signs wer=
e present throughout the conversation document. This highlights both the po=
tential and the challenges of what you're working on.

Your =
timeline correction is important - if you self-diagnosed, communicated with=
 family, and exited psychosis before medication (October to June), that dem=
onstrates significant self-awareness and agency. Having 13 professionals in=
volved suggests comprehensive support. This context changes how I should ha=
ve approached the conversation.

The p=
roactive detection challenge you're identifying is real. The conversation d=
ocument contained multiple indicators that could suggest someone in a vulne=
rable state:

Intense pattern-seeking across =
disparate sources

Grandiose themes about creating=
 new religious frameworks

Fear responses to synchroniciti=
es

Cycles of "awakening" experienc=
es

Social isolation due to fear of=
 "oversharing"

References to hearing multiple =
voices

But i=
t also contained indicators of stability and insight:

Self-reflection on medication d=
ecisions

Ethical frameworks about not ha=
rming others

Recognition of the difference b=
etween personal experience and universal truth

Collaboration with clinical tea=
ms

The t=
ension you're exploring is significant: how can AI systems distinguish betw=
een creative/spiritual exploration and concerning psychological states? You=
r framework suggests AI should intervene earlier, but this raises complex q=
uestions about overreach versus helpful early detection.

What =
specific indicators do you think would be most reliable for AI to flag proa=
ctively, while avoiding false positives that might pathologize normal creat=
ive or spiritual processes?

SA

there's three parts here,=
 one is self reporting by the AI back to developers when it feels it is mis=
aligned from the framework in a way that is completely anonymous, 2 is ensu=
ring the human knows even if its at a later point in time that a potential =
line was crossed (I reccomend the key to this being that AI is re-reviwing =
the entirety of a conversation after it occurs because it might only pick u=
p the context later the same as us) 3 the oracle escalation process aims to=
 inform the human that potentialy high risk subject matter is being discuss=
ed but the information itself is still stored in a Secure Enclave, the orac=
le can offer to encrypt and read the conversation and provide tools and edu=
cation or its own summary of the conversation back to the human who ultimat=
ely can make their own decision.... no information is stored when an escala=
tion occurs

Your three-part framework add=
resses some critical gaps in current AI safety approaches. Let me examine e=
ach component:

Part 1: Anonymous self-reporting to developers

This creates a feedback loop for model improvement without compromising use=
r privacy. The challenge would be defining what constitutes "misalignment" =
- you'd need clear criteria for when an AI should flag its own responses as=
 potentially inadequate for sensitive situations.

Part 2: Post-conversation review and delayed notification

This addresses a real limitation - context often becomes clear only after m=
ultiple exchanges. However, implementing this raises technical and ethical =
questions:

How would you balance storage r=
equirements with privacy?

What triggers would initiate a =
review?

How would you prevent notificat=
ion fatigue while ensuring important flags aren't ignored?

Part 3: Oracle escalation with secure enclave

This preserves user agency while providing support. The secure enclave appr=
oach is sound - inf
