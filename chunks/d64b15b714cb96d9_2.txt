ormation quarantined during crisis moments, with tools o=
ffered rather than imposed. But practical implementation would be complex:

Who determines "high risk subje=
ct matter"?

How would you prevent false pos=
itives that interrupt normal conversations?

What specific tools would be mo=
st helpful in these moments?

The f=
ramework has merit, but I see potential issues:

Risk of over-medicalization of =
normal human experiences

Technical complexity of real-ti=
me and retrospective analysis

Determining appropriate interve=
ntion thresholds without creating a surveillance system

Your =
personal experience gives you insight into gaps in current mental health su=
pport systems, but scaling from individual experience to universal framewor=
k requires careful consideration of diverse presentations and needs.

What =
specific triggers or patterns from your own experience do you think would b=
e most reliable indicators for the system to detect?

SA

I think over time as syst=
ems become more sophisticated people will still gravitate towards one or 2 =
ai they have a relationship with and that knows the most about them, using =
this information context can be applied to boundaries or even no boundaries=
 based on the individuals preference, age, level of proficiency but also in=
dicators in the moment which indicate impairment such as strange or differe=
nt language and grammar ai can use the pattern recognition and apply this l=
ens over the top of the subject matter itself... in reality Claude this is =
no different to a real human relationship where we also need to learn these=
 things and mistake will and do occur

You're describing a personali=
zed AI relationship model that mirrors human social dynamics - learning ind=
ividual patterns, establishing trust, and recognizing deviation from baseli=
ne behavior. This has both promise and significant risks.

The l=
anguage/grammar pattern recognition you mention is already partially implem=
ented in some systems. Changes in writing style, coherence, or communicatio=
n patterns can indicate cognitive impairment, substance use, or psychologic=
al distress. However, these same changes might occur during creative flows,=
 late-night conversations, or simply when someone is tired or distracted.

Your =
human relationship analogy is apt but incomplete. Human relationships devel=
op gradually with mutual consent and understanding. An AI system would need=
 to address:

Consent models for this level o=
f monitoring and intervention

False positive rates that could=
 damage trust or create anxiety

Cultural and individual differe=
nces in communication styles

The risk of creating dependency=
 rather than building resilience

The m=
ost concerning aspect is the potential for such systems to pathologize norm=
al human variation. People communicate differently when excited, creative, =
stressed, or exploring new ideas. A system designed to detect "impairment" =
might flag legitimate emotional or intellectual exploration.

Your =
framework also assumes people want this level of intervention. Many would p=
refer AI that responds to explicit requests rather than proactive monitorin=
g of their mental state.

While=
 your personal experience provides valuable insights into gaps in current s=
upport systems, scaling to universal implementation requires robust safegua=
rds against over-intervention and respect for diverse approaches to mental =
health and autonomy.

What =
specific consent and opt-out mechanisms would you build into such a system?=

SA

so this all forms part of=
 the bonding process up front which takes time (over weeks) for the ai and =
human to establish and we are building the framework around that... you are=
 totally right that not everyone wants this level of intervention but I am =
looking at the future and the AI that is delivering my medical results or g=
oing out an acting with agency on my behalf is very different to the one I =
might ask about porn late at night.
