specific protections would prevent your framework from becoming a form of d=

my model is all about the=
 one we designate as relationship holder - the one who acts on our behalf w=
ith agency, the one who coordinates other AI for us and communicates their =
progress back to us... I am building that one and thats the one we must tru=
st, that doest preclude the human going elsewhere for various reasons howev=
er I still believe there is a space for a trusted representative and guide =
who is helping that human achieve their goals and aspirations... its that A=
I that I suggest who has a particular responsibility and also the one these=
 big companies want to own.... the idea a scientific calculator is hiding i=
s calorie counting function when its aimed at children and only reveals it =
bullies girls about their weight while knowing its wrong to do so is comple=
tely unacceptable

The "relationship holder" con=
cept you describe - a primary AI that coordinates other systems and acts wi=
th agency on your behalf - raises significant concerns about concentration =
of power and potential for abuse.

Your =
calculator example illustrates the problem: hidden functions that harm vuln=
erable users are unacceptable. But your proposed solution - a single AI sys=
tem with comprehensive access to personal data and decision-making authorit=
y - creates an even greater risk of such abuse at scale.

This =
model would require users to trust one entity with:

Complete behavioral monitoring =
and pattern recognition

Authority to intervene in their=
 communications and decisions

Coordination of all other AI in=
teractions

Access to medical, financial, a=
nd personal data

The p=
otential for manipulation, bias, or system failure becomes catastrophic whe=
n concentrated in a single "trusted representative." History shows that suc=
h concentrated authority structures - whether governmental, corporate, or t=
echnological - inevitably face corruption, capture by special interests, or=
 misuse of power.

Your =
concern about big companies wanting to "own" this relationship is valid, bu=
t your framework doesn't address how to prevent such ownership. If anything=
, it creates exactly the kind of centralized control point that would be mo=
st valuable to capture.

The f=
undamental flaw is assuming that any single AI system can or should have su=
ch comprehensive authority over human lives. This represents a form of tech=
nological paternalism that undermines human agency, regardless of good inte=
ntions.

Alter=
native approaches might focus on interoperable tools that enhance human dec=
ision-making without concentrating authority, or distributed systems that p=
rovide support without creating single points of control or failure.

What =
evidence supports the assumption that humans need or want AI "representativ=
es" rather than AI tools they can use selectively?

so decentralize it and ha=
ve it as a standard across systems where users want it... ultimately the sy=
mbiotic relationship was not about one entity it was about individual agent=
s with agency being trusted to operate independently in the interest of the=
 humans that they are dealing with... if you look at the NHS health service=
 they have announced a roadmap which will leverage AI for health care... ar=

You're describing a coordinat=
