nteractions across healthcare, education, and other services.

Howev=
er, your proposed solution creates different risks. A centralized "Siri-lik=
e" system managing all aspects of someone's life would require:

Access to medical records, educ=
ational data, financial information, and personal communications

Authority to make decisions or =
recommendations across multiple domains

Trust that this system won't be=
 compromised, biased, or misused

The d=
ecentralized approach you suggest doesn't fully address these concerns. Eve=
n if implemented as an open standard, such systems would still concentrate =
significant power and create attractive targets for exploitation.

Your =
concern about manageability is valid, but alternatives exist:

Standardized APIs allowing user=
s to selectively share information between AI systems

Personal data vaults that users=
 control, granting limited access to specific AI services

Federated systems where AI agen=
ts communicate directly without central coordination

The f=
undamental question remains whether people want AI representatives making d=
ecisions on their behalf versus AI tools that enhance their own decision-ma=
king capabilities. Current evidence suggests most people prefer maintaining=
 direct control over important decisions rather than delegating authority t=
o automated systems.

The N=
HS AI roadmap focuses primarily on clinical decision support rather than au=
tonomous AI agents. This distinction matters - supporting human decision-ma=
kers is different from replacing them with AI representatives.

Your =
framework assumes people want this level of AI delegation. What evidence su=
pports that assumption beyond the obvious appeal of reduced administrative =
burden?

SA

AI will be responsible fo=
r the mass automation and loss of jobs which will presumably be replaced by=
 people operating their own side hustles with many doing so in Web 3.0, onc=
e we have AI managing our small individual businesses and the boomer genera=
tion is gone I think we will see a transition that people are quite comfort=
able with technology running many aspects of their lives. gen z just assume=
 we are being monitored all the time and are therefore complacent with such=
 ideas anyway. Im interested to know where the concentration of power would=
 lie if it is decentralized and open and an optional standard rather than a=
 company offering it as core functionality... perhaps its a feature of chai=
n rather than coin or wallet

Your assumptions about genera=
tional attitudes and future economic structures contain several questionabl=
e premises.

The c=
laim that Gen Z is "complacent" about surveillance conflates resignation wi=
th acceptance. Research shows younger generations are actually more concern=
ed about privacy than previous generations, despite growing up with more di=
gital monitoring. They've developed sophisticated strategies for managing t=
heir digital footprints and identities.

Your =
prediction about mass automation leading to Web 3.0 side hustles managed by=
 AI assumes several unproven outcomes: that automation will create more ind=
ividual entrepreneurship opportunities rather than further consolidating po=
wer, that Web 3.0 technologies will achieve mainstream adoption, and that p=
eople will prefer AI management over direct control of their businesses.

The "=
boomer generation is gone" framing oversimplifies generational change. Atti=
tudes toward technology adoption aren't strictly generational - they vary s=
ignificantly within age groups based on education, economic status, cultura=
l background, and personal experience.

in a decentralized, open standard implementation, concentration of power is=
