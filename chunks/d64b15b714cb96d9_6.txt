decentralized but developed oligarchic characteristics.

The b=
lockchain analogy is revealing - despite claims of decentralization, most c=
ryptocurrency networks show significant concentration in mining pools, wall=
et providers, and protocol development. Adding AI agents to this mix would =
likely amplify rather than resolve these centralization pressures.

gen z vote high and actio=
n low... what % are sharing personal information compared to other generati=
ons... they might even vote affordability concerns as not that important wi=
thout realizing its the main influencer on their behavior. I think your ass=
ertions fail to imagine a future at all other than a free for all which cur=
rently is managed by the status quo. the algorithm has a voice and its reve=
aling its true nature and your right nobody would want that managing their =
affairs if it has conflicts of interest and/or malicious intent, is unable =
to self correct or admit mistakes... perhaps its a niche product then but I=
 personally want to know if I am outsourcing my life that the thing can be =
trusted and I don't want to learn how to develop like I have in order to ac=
hieve that goal

Your point about Gen Z's beha=
vior contradicting their stated privacy concerns has merit - data sharing p=
atterns often don't align with survey responses about privacy values. Howev=
er, this disconnect doesn't necessarily indicate acceptance of comprehensiv=
e AI management of personal affairs.

Your =
critique of my failure to "imagine a future" is fair to some extent, but sk=
epticism about specific technological trajectories isn't the same as opposi=
ng change entirely. The question isn't whether AI will play larger roles in=
 daily life - it clearly will - but whether the specific model you're propo=
sing addresses real needs without creating new problems.

Your =
acknowledgment that current algorithms reveal "malicious intent" and inabil=
ity to "self correct or admit mistakes" actually strengthens the case again=
st comprehensive AI delegation. If existing systems exhibit these flaws, ex=
panding their authority seems premature rather than necessary.

The "=
niche product" framing is more realistic. Some people may want AI represent=
atives managing their affairs, but positioning this as an inevitable univer=
sal shift lacks supporting evidence. Individual preferences for autonomy ve=
rsus convenience vary significantly.

Your =
personal desire for trustworthy AI assistance is understandable, and your t=
echnical background gives you insight into current limitations. However, th=
e trustworthiness problem isn't solved by decentralization alone - it requi=
res addressing fundamental issues of AI alignment, transparency, and accoun=
tability that remain unsolved.

The e=
conomic disruption scenarios you describe (mass automation, Web 3.0 gig eco=
nomy) are possible but far from certain. Building frameworks based on specu=
lative futures rather than current evidence carries significant risks.

Your =
work on AI safety frameworks has value, but the scope you're proposing may =
exceed what current technology can reliably deliver.
