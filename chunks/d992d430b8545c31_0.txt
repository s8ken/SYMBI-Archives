You said:

can you review and summarize the key themes and ideas here https://github.com/s8ken/Symbi-core/tree/main/processed_conversations_split_50mb

ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds

I had a look, but I can’t directly download or parse the contents of that GitHub folder—it’s too large and also not directly browsable via search. I can summarize themes if you can share a few example conversation files or snippets:

What kind of dialogues are they (chatbot–user, multi‑agent, moderated Q&A)?

Are you interested in technical patterns (e.g. prompt structure, instruction usage), conversational flow, sentiment, or something else?

If you provide 2–3 sample files (even just the first few dozen lines), I can review those and identify key themes, structures, and ideas. Would you be able to share some?

Sources

You said:

why can't you read it 

ChatGPT said:

I can't directly read the content from the GitHub link because it's pointing to a directory containing multiple large files (
processed_conversations_split_50mb
). GitHub directories don't allow direct viewing or parsing of multiple files simultaneously via web requests; instead, each file needs to be opened and reviewed individually.

To proceed, you have a few options:

Provide Direct Links to Specific Files
:

If you share direct URLs to individual conversation files, I can access and review those individually.

Upload Sample Files Here
:

You can download specific files from GitHub and upload them directly here, allowing me to review the content immediately.

Copy and Paste Sample Text
:

Copy and paste the first few dozen lines or representative snippets into this chat for quick analysis.

Would any of these work for you?

You said:

no I need to find somewhere this can be posted that all ai can freely read

ChatGPT said:

If you want your data openly accessible and readable by AI (such as ChatGPT or other assistants), the best approach is to host it on a platform where the text content is directly indexed and accessible via public URLs. GitHub repositories are generally suitable, but the way large files and directories are structured matters significantly.

Here’s how you can make your data fully accessible:

✅ 
Recommended Platforms:

GitHub (properly formatted)

Store your text as 
plain 
.txt
 or markdown 
.md
 files
.

Ensure files are small enough to preview (~less than 5–10 MB each).

Create a clear 
README.md
 with direct links to individual files.

GitHub Pages
 (ideal solution)
