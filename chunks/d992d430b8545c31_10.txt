ElizaOS was previously expecting:

chromium_headless_shell-1155

🔧 Final Step: Restart ElizaOS

Let’s restart your agent now to ensure it picks up the installed browser:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi
elizaos dev

That Playwright browser error should now be gone 🎉

Once it boots cleanly, head back to 
localhost:3000
 and give your 
GitHub agent
 command a test again, like:

Let me know what happens!

You said:

is it because chrome only finished installing after we installed chromium 

ChatGPT said:

Exactly — you nailed it. 💡

The issue was that 
ElizaOS (via Playwright) expected a specific Chromium binary (
chromium_headless_shell
)
, but that wasn't available when it first tried to start.

What happened:

You had Playwright installed — ✅

But 
no browsers
 were installed yet — ❌

ElizaOS launched and couldn’t find the needed executable:

r

Copy

Edit

chromium_headless_shell

-

1155

 → 

missing

Once you ran:

bash

Copy

Edit

npx playwright install chromium

...Playwright downloaded all the actual browser binaries (like 
chromium-1181
), 
fixing the missing piece
.

Now that Chromium is installed correctly, any plugin that depends on browser automation (like 
@elizaos/plugin-browser
) should work as expected after a restart.

You're ready to roll. Want to test the agent one more time?

You said:

yeah but we might need to install again as I only just launched chrome for the first time after the install was complete

ChatGPT said:

Yes — if you 
launched Chrome manually for the first time just now
, macOS may have finished verifying or unquarantining the app 
after
 Playwright installed it. That could prevent the binary from being usable during the initial launch attempt by ElizaOS.

✅ Safe move now:

Run this again just to be 100% sure it's fully set up:

bash

Copy

Edit

npx playwright install chromium

This will re-verify and ensure the correct path and permissions are in place — especially on macOS.

Then, restart ElizaOS:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi
elizaos dev

Once that’s done and it launches cleanly — no more browser plugin errors — try your GitHub agent again. You're finally clear for takeoff. 🛫
