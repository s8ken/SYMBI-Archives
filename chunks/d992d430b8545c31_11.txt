🎉 
YES! You did it.
 That startup log is 
clean
 — no errors, no Playwright complaints, no missing agents. Just pure ✅ goodness.

✅ What this means:

Your 
Playwright install
 is now fully functional

Port 3000
 is working (no conflicts)

Your 
agent 
Eliza

 is initialized and connected

All configured 
plugins
 have migrated properly

👇 Now the fun part

Open your browser to:

arduino

Copy

Edit

http:

//localhost:3000

Then select your agent (e.g. 
Eliza
 or 
symbi-assistant
 if renamed), and test with something like:

plaintext

Copy

Edit

List all my GitHub repositories.

or

plaintext

Copy

Edit

Analyze the repo s8ken/Symbi-core.

We’ll confirm GitHub access, then move to shell + filesystem powers. Let’s go!
