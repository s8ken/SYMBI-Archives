Ahh! Sneaky—but now we know 
exactly
 what’s happening.

Your agent 

Eliza

 starts cleanly, but 

symbi-assistant

 (your custom one) is still referencing the 
old Playwright browser path
:

Copy

Edit

chromium_headless_shell-1155

🔧 Why this is happening

ElizaOS is hardcoded (for now) to look for a specific versioned headless shell — but your system has installed:

Copy

Edit

chromium-1181

So the mismatch continues unless we:

Trick it
 into seeing what it wants

Disable the plugin
 (if not needed yet)

✅ Option 1: Create a symbolic link (fixes it manually)

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright

ln

 -s chromium-1181 chromium_headless_shell-1155

This creates a fake alias so ElizaOS thinks the exact version it wants exists — and uses the working browser you installed.

🧼 Option 2: Disable the browser plugin

If you're not using 
@elizaos/plugin-browser
 yet:

Go to 
localhost:3000

Open your agent: 
symbi-assistant

Go to 
Plugins

Toggle off 
plugin-browser

Click 
Save

Then restart:

bash

Copy

Edit

elizaos dev

Either fix will stop that error for good. Let me know which route you pick!
