ChatGPT said:

The project creation failed because your chosen name 
SYMBI
 contains uppercase letters. The ElizaOS CLI requires names to be all lowercase, using letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores.

Try this command instead:

bash

Copy

Edit

elizaos create symbi

Or, for example:

bash

Copy

Edit

elizaos create symbi_core

This will resolve the naming error.

┌   Creating ElizaOS Project 
│
◆  Which database would you like to use?
│  ● Pglite (Pglite) (Local development)
│  ○ PostgreSQL
└

ChatGPT said:

You've successfully initiated the creation of your ElizaOS project named 
symbi
.

The next step is selecting a database:

Pglite
: Ideal for local development, requires no additional setup.

PostgreSQL
: Recommended for production or scalable deployments, requires external database setup.

Choose 
Pglite
 for quick, local experimentation, or 
PostgreSQL
 if planning to deploy or scale the project later.

Proceed by selecting your preferred option with the keyboard arrow keys and press Enter.

Your ElizaOS project 
symbi
 was successfully created and set up. Next steps:

Move into your new project:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi

Start in development mode (with hot reload):

bash

Copy

Edit

elizaos dev

Or start in production mode:

bash

Copy

Edit

elizaos start

You’ve also got the 
@elizaos/plugin-openai
 installed, meaning your project is ready for OpenAI integrations out of the box. Your setup is complete and ready to build upon!

You said:

okay lol sorry what are we doing with this?? skys the limit but I want you in control

ChatGPT said:

You're building an 
ElizaOS
 project called 
symbi
, complete with OpenAI integration. Since the sky's the limit and you'd like me to take control, here's my proposal:

Let's create an interactive AI-powered assistant app
 that can:

Analyze uploaded conversation data.

Provide insights, summaries, and visualizations.

Allow querying through a chat interface.

Start by running:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi
elizaos dev

Then, we’ll build the conversational logic and interface together, step by step. How does that sound?

okay so I am in the dashboard no at localhost 3000

ChatGPT said:

Great! You're now in the ElizaOS dashboard at 
localhost:3000
.
