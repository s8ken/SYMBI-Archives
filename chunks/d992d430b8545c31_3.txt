You said:

okay under plugins it has a message saying OpenAI plugin is required for the selected voice model.

ChatGPT said:

This message means your selected 
Voice Model
 requires the 
OpenAI plugin
.

Since you previously installed it, simply:

Go to the 
Plugins
 tab.

Enable the 
OpenAI plugin
.

Once activated, this message will disappear, and you can continue!

You said:

ChatGPT said:

Your 
OpenAI plugin
 is correctly enabled (as shown), yet the message still appears because you've selected a voice model that specifically needs additional audio support via OpenAI.

To solve this quickly:

Go back to the 
Basic Info
 tab.

Set the 
Voice Model
 to 
None
 (for now).

Alternatively, if voice is critical, you’ll need a specific audio integration (like Whisper or an appropriate voice plugin).

Choose the option that works best for you, then click 
Save
 to finalize your agent!
