okay lets do the voice after and I can talk to you here anyway for now

ChatGPT said:

Perfect—your 
symbi-assistant
 agent is now created, fully customized, and ready for interaction.

Next Steps:

Click 
Save
.

Go to the 
Agents
 list, select 
symbi-assistant
, and test interactions.

We can tackle 
voice integration
 later. For now, interact through text and refine the agent's abilities based on your needs. Let me know how your first test goes!

You're currently on the 
Secret
 tab, which handles your API keys and sensitive information. Good news—the 
OpenAI API key
 is already detected from your global settings and ready to go, so no extra action is needed here.

You can safely proceed by clicking 
Save
, completing setup of your agent. Let’s test it out!

ChatGPT said:

Awesome! Your 
symbi-assistant
 agent is fully operational and ready to go. You've done it successfully. 🎉

Now, we can enhance it further by adding functionalities such as:

Conversation analysis
 (upload and summarize your data)

Advanced query responses

Custom visualizations and reporting

Tell me what you'd like to tackle next, or if you have specific features in mind!

You said:

okay lets give it some command - can it help me with my local machine

ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can enable 
local machine assistance
 by adding a command plugin.

Recommended action
:

Go back to your 
symbi-assistant
 plugins tab.

Search for and enable plugins like:

@elizaos/plugin-shell

(executes shell commands)

@elizaos/plugin-filesystem

(file management and browsing)

These plugins will allow the assistant to directly help with tasks on your local machine like running scripts, managing files, and providing system information.

Confirm once enabled, and we'll test commands together!

okay I want to give GitHub access where do I find the token

ChatGPT said:

To get a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):

Log into GitHub, click your profile icon (top-right corner).

Go to 
Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
.

Click 
Generate new token
, select token type ("classic" is common).

Choose the required scopes (e.g., 
repo
, 
read:user
).

Click 
Generate token
. Save it securely—GitHub shows it only once.

ChatGPT said:

You're nearly there! Here's where to go next:

On the left-hand menu (as shown in your screenshot), scroll down to 
“Developer settings”
 — it's below “Moderation” and above “Repositories”.

Then click:

→ 
Personal access tokens

→ 
Tokens (classic)

→ 
Generate new token

From there:

Give it a name like 
symbi-eliza

Set the 
expiration
 (or “No expiration” for dev use)

Check the 
scopes
 you need, usually:

repo
 (full repo access)

read:user

workflow
 (if you’ll trigger GitHub Actions)

Click 
Generate token
, copy it, and save it somewhere secure.

Once you’ve got the token, I’ll help you plug it into ElizaOS as a secret.

You said:

so its not a client secret

ChatGPT said:

Correct — it's not an 
OAuth client secret
, it's a 
Personal Access Token (PAT)
.

✅ You're using:

A 
Personal Access Token (classic)
 — used by your ElizaOS agent to authenticate 
as you
, with direct repo access.

Use it if you want your assistant to:

Read/write to your repos

Analyze files or code

Interact with GitHub Actions

If you wanted to authorize 
as an app
, you’d use:

A 
GitHub OAuth App

Or a 
GitHub App
 with client ID & secret

But for our setup (you + your agent), a 
PAT is the right call.

Once you’ve copied it, I’ll show you exactly where to add it in ElizaOS!

ChatGPT said:

You're currently viewing your 
GitHub App
 configuration (
symbi-agent
) — which is great for app-level integrations — but if you just want 
Symbi-Assistant to access your repos and files directly
, a 
Personal Access Token (PAT)
 is simpler and quicker.

Here’s how to get the PAT:

Go to 
GitHub Tokens (Classic)
