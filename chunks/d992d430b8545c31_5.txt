(classic)"
.

Name it something like 
elizaos-symbi-access
.

Check scopes
 like:

repo
 → for private repos

read:user

workflow
 (optional, for GitHub Actions)

Click 
Generate
, then 
copy the token
 immediately.

Then, in ElizaOS:

Go to your 
symbi-assistant → Secrets
 tab.

Under 
Name
, enter:

nginx

Copy

Edit

GITHUB_PAT

Under 
Value
, paste your new token.

Click 
Add
, then 
Save
.

Let me know when that’s done — I’ll show you how to use it for GitHub-powered queries next.

Perfect — you've now enabled powerful plugins, including:

✅ 
@elizaos/plugin-shell
 → run shell commands

✅ 
@elizaos/plugin-github
 → GitHub integration

✅ 
@elizaos/plugin-browser
, 
pdf
, 
knowledge
, etc. → great for research and content handling

Next, if you’ve created your 
GitHub token
 already, here’s how to wire it in:

🔐 Add the GitHub Token to ElizaOS:

Go to your 
symbi-assistant → Secret
 tab

In 
Name
, enter:

nginx

Copy

Edit

GITHUB_PAT

In 
Value
, paste your Personal Access Token

Click 
Add
, then 
Save

Once that’s done, you can try your first command, like:

text

Copy

Edit

List all my GitHub repos.

Or something deeper like:

text

Copy

Edit

Analyze the README and code in s8ken/Symbi-core.

Ready to test that?

You said:

I added it here was that wrong?

ChatGPT said:

Nope — you're spot on! 🙌

You added your GitHub token correctly under:

nginx

Copy

Edit

GITHUB_TOKEN

✅ It matches what the 
@elizaos/plugin-github
 expects (despite the earlier suggestion to use 
GITHUB_PAT
, ElizaOS is clearly looking for 
GITHUB_TOKEN
, as shown in your UI).

🔧 You're now fully wired up.

Let’s test it. Go to your 
agent chat
 and try one of these:

plaintext

Copy

Edit

List all my public GitHub repositories.

or

plaintext

Copy

Edit

Summarize the main purpose of the repository s8ken/Symbi-core.

Let’s see your agent in action!

You said:

yeah it the agent had an error when I tried running it :(

ChatGPT said:

Ah—got it. Let's fix that. First, let’s quickly narrow it down:

🔍 Troubleshooting Steps:

Check the Error Message in the Agent Chat

What did the assistant say exactly? (Paste it here if you can)

Was it a plugin error, auth issue, or command failure?

Check the ElizaOS Dev Console

In your terminal where you ran 
elizaos dev
, look for:

Any red error messages

Plugin loading failures

Authentication issues (e.g. GitHub 401)

Confirm Token Scope

Go back to your GitHub PAT and confirm it has at least:

✅ 
repo
 (for private repo access)

✅ 
read:user

Optional test command (to isolate plugin):

Try something very basic in the agent chat:

plaintext

Copy

Edit

Use the GitHub plugin to get my GitHub username.

If that fails too, we’ll know the plugin’s not authenticating properly.

Send me the error response or logs, and I’ll walk you through the fix!
