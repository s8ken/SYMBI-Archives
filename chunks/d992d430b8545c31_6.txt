Perfect — thanks for sharing the logs. Here's what happened and how to fix it:

🛠️ The real issue:

vbnet

Copy

Edit

Failed 

to

 register service browser: launch: Executable doesn

't exist...

This error is caused by the 

@elizaos/plugin-browser

 trying to run Playwright, but the required browser binaries aren't installed yet.

✅ Fix (run this in your terminal):

bash

Copy

Edit

npx playwright install

This will download the required Chromium binary (
headless_shell
) that the browser plugin needs.

⚠️ Optional:

If you’re not planning to use the browser plugin right now (web scraping, browsing, etc.), you can 
temporarily disable it
 in your agent's Plugins tab to avoid errors — but installing Playwright is the proper fix.

Let me know when that finishes — then we’ll retry the GitHub command!

Nice work! ✅ With Playwright installed, the browser plugin should now behave—and no more errors should block other plugins like GitHub.

Let’s test your 
GitHub integration
 again. Try one of these in the agent chat:

plaintext

Copy

Edit

List all repositories in my GitHub account.

or

plaintext

Copy

Edit

Summarize the README in s8ken/Symbi-core.

Let’s confirm your agent is fully operational now!

Got it — Playwright still can't find the required Chromium binary, even after install.

This is usually caused by one of these:

✅ 
Fix (Force Install the Right Browsers):

Try this command instead:

bash

Copy

Edit

npx playwright install chromium

This installs 
only Chromium
, which is what ElizaOS is expecting at:

swift

Copy

Edit

/Users/

admin

/Library/

Caches

/ms-playwright/

chromium_headless_shell

-

1155

/

🔄 If That Doesn’t Work:

Clear and reinstall from scratch:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright
npx playwright install chromium

🧼 Optional: Disable Plugin (Until Needed)

If you're not using the 
@elizaos/plugin-browser
 yet, disable it in the 
Plugins
 tab of your agent to suppress this error entirely.

Let me know if Chromium installs cleanly — then we’ll re-test GitHub!
