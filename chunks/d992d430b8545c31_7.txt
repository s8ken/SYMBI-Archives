Thanks — that output confirms it: 
Playwright isn't fully installed yet
, and that's why ElizaOS is still throwing browser errors.

Let’s fix it cleanly.

✅ Final Fix — Run These in Order:

Install Playwright

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install @playwright/test --save-dev

Install Chromium

bash

Copy

Edit

npx playwright install chromium

This will properly download the needed binary to the expected path.

(Optional but Safe) 
Restart ElizaOS

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi
elizaos dev

🧼 OR Disable the Plugin

If you 
don’t need the browser plugin now
, disable 
@elizaos/plugin-browser
 in the Plugins tab to silence the errors entirely.

Once you’ve done either of these, we’ll retest the GitHub integration. You’re very close now!
