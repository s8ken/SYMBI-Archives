Thanks for posting the logs — you're in excellent shape except for 
one small final issue
:

❌ Error: 
Port 3000 is already in use

This just means something (probably another ElizaOS or dev server) is still running in the background on port 
3000
.

✅ Fix It:

Option 1: Kill whatever’s using port 3000

Run this in your terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

lsof -i :3000

That’ll show you the process using port 3000 (e.g., Node, Bun, etc.). Then:

bash

Copy

Edit

kill

 -9 <PID>

Replace 
<PID>
 with the actual process ID from the above.

Option 2: Start ElizaOS on a different port

If you want to run multiple agents or projects at once:

bash

Copy

Edit

elizaos dev --port 3001

(Or any other available port.)

Once it boots without errors, open your browser to 
http://localhost:3001
 (or whichever port you chose), and you’ll be right back in business.

Let me know which way you go and I’ll help verify it’s working!
