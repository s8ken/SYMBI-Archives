You're really close — just a small tweak needed. Here's what to do:

🔍 Step 1: Identify the PID

From your 
lsof -i :3000
 output, this is the key line:

ruby

Copy

Edit

bun       

6261

 admin    ...   

TCP

 *

:hbci

 (

LISTEN

)

That means 
PID 
6261

 is running on port 3000 (Apple labels it 
hbci
, but it's still port 3000).

✅ Step 2: Kill the Process

Now run:

bash

Copy

Edit

kill

 -9 6261

🔁 Step 3: Restart Your Project

Once that's killed, restart ElizaOS:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 symbi
elizaos dev

That should boot cleanly on port 3000 now.

Let me know once you're back in — we’ll continue with GitHub testing!

That final error confirms: 
Playwright is installed
, but 
the actual browser binary (Chromium)
 still isn’t.

Let’s do the cleanest and final fix to stop this once and for all:

✅ Step-by-step fix

Install Playwright and Chromium properly:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install @playwright/test --save-dev
npx playwright install chromium

Verify the binary path is created:

Check if this now exists:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 /Users/admin/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/

You should see a 
chromium-...
 folder.

🧼 OR Disable the Plugin

If you 
don’t need the browser plugin
 (used for web browsing or scraping), disable it in your agent config:

Go to 
localhost:3000

Select your 
symbi-assistant

Go to 
Plugins

Toggle off 
@elizaos/plugin-browser

Click 
Save

That will stop the Playwright-related startup errors entirely — and your agent will still work great with GitHub, shell, and OpenAI.

Once you've picked a path (install or disable), let me know — then we test GitHub again!
