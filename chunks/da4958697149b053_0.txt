User:
What is Symbi2?
Assistant:
Symbi2 sounds like a product, project, or system name, but I don=E2=80=99t =
have context. Could you clarify what Symbi2 refers to?
User:
It=E2=80=99s a cognitive architecture for embodied AI agents. I want help b=
uilding it.
Assistant:
Excellent. For building a cognitive architecture like Symbi2 for embodied A=
I, we=E2=80=99ll need to define its components, such as:
Perception: handling sensor input
Action: motor output and planning
Memory: episodic, semantic, and procedural
Learning: adaptation mechanisms
Reasoning: symbolic or sub-symbolic inference
Communication: language or signal-based interaction
Would you like to begin with a high-level architecture or jump into specifi=
c components?
User:
Start with a high-level system diagram.
Assistant:
Sure. Here's a conceptual breakdown:
[ Sensors ] --> [ Perception ] --> [ Working Memory ] <--> [ Lo=
ng-Term Memory ]
                                            |
                                            v
                                      [ Reasoning ]
                                            |
                                            v
                                     [ Action Selection ] --> [ Actuator=
s ]
We can extend this further by adding subsystems like:
Learning Module (connected to perception and memory)
Dialogue Manager (if agents interact with humans)
Goal Manager (for autonomous behavior)
Shall I turn this into a more detailed module breakdown?
User:
Yes. Add internal blackboard, attention system, and multimodal integration.
Assistant:
Here=E2=80=99s an expanded view incorporating your requested components:

[ Perception ]

[ Multimodal Integration ]
     |
[ Attention System ]

[ Internal Blackboard ] <---> [ Working Memory ] <---> [ Long-T=
erm Memory ]
                                         |
                                     [ Reasoning ]
                                         |
                                 [ Action Selection ]
                                         |
                                  [ Actuators ]
Each component can be further decomposed. For example:
Multimodal Integration: fuses visual, auditory, haptic input
Internal Blackboard: shared data structure for inter-module communication
Attention System: prioritizes which input/goal is processed
Next steps could include specifying algorithms or data flows for each modul=

Design pseudocode for internal blackboard data exchange.
Assistant:
Here=E2=80=99s a conceptual pseudocode for a publish-subscribe style intern=
al blackboard:
class Blackboard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data =3D {}
        self.subscribers =3D {}

    def publish(self, key, value):
        self.data[key] =3D value
        if key in self.subscribers:
            for callback in self.subscribers[key]:
