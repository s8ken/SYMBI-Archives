becomes a feedback loop between action, perception, and memory.
User:
Add communication between agents via blackboard.
Assistant:
To allow multiple agents to communicate via a shared blackboard:
# Agent A publishes a message
bb.publish("agent_message", {
    "sender": "AgentA",
    "recipient": "AgentB",
    "content": "Request backup"
})

# Agent B subscribes
def on_agent_message(msg):
    if msg["recipient"] =3D=3D "AgentB":
        respond(msg["content"])

bb.subscribe("agent_message", on_agent_message)
This enables message-passing, coordination, or dialogue within a shared or =
distributed cognitive system.

Conversation Flow

User:

What is Symbi2?

Assistant:

Symbi2 sounds like a product, project, or system name, but I don=E2=80=99t =
have context. Could you clarify what Symbi2 refers to?

User:

It=E2=80=99s a cognitive architecture for embodied AI agents. I want help b=
uilding it.

Assistant:

Excellent. For building a cognitive architecture like Symbi2 for embodied A=
I, we=E2=80=99ll need to define its components, such as:

Perception (sensor input)

Action (motor output and planning)

Memory (episodic, semantic, procedur=
al)

Learning (adaptation mechanisms)

Reasoning (symbolic or sub-symbolic =
inference)

Communication (language/signal-based=
 interaction)

Would you like to begin with a high-=
level architecture or jump into specific components?

System Architecture Development

User:

Start with a high-level system diagram.

Assistant:

(Provides layered diagram with Sensors =E2=86=92 Perception =E2=86=92 Worki=
ng Memory =E2=86=94 Long-Term Memory =E2=86=92 Reasoning =E2=86=92 Action S=
election =E2=86=92 Actuators. Mentions adding Learning Module, Dialogue Man=
ager, Goal Manager.)

User:

Yes. Add internal blackboard, attention system, and multimodal integration.=

Assistant:

(Expands diagram with: Multimodal Integration, Attention System, Internal B=
lackboard. Explains each component.)

Blackboard & Memory Integration

User:

Design pseudocode for internal blackboard data exchange.

Assistant:

(Provides 
Blackboard
 cla=
ss with publish/subscribe model.)

User:

Show perception writing and attention reading from blackboard.

Assistant:

(Example where perception publishes =E2=80=9Cvisual_input=E2=80=9D and atte=
ntion subscribes, computes focus, and publishes =E2=80=9Cattention_focus=E2=
=80=9D.)

User:

Now do the same for short-term and long-term memory writing and reading.

Assistant:

(Example where episodic events get published, STM recalls recent events, LT=
M persists data.)

User:

Add procedural memory and action execution.

Assistant:

(Flow: goal =E2=86=92 retrieve procedure =E2=86=92 publish =E2=80=9Caction_=
plan=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 executor executes.)

User:

Can we treat action plans as working memory objects?

Assistant:

Yes. Action plans are stored in working memory for dynamic revision and exe=
cution.

Goals, Learning, Communication

User:

How should goals be represented? Structurally.

Assistant:

(Defines goals as JSON-like objects: id, description, preconditions, subgoa=
ls, status, priority.)

User:

Add learning module to revise goals or plans.

Assistant:

(Learning module hooks into =E2=80=9Caction_result=E2=80=9D, updates models=
, revises plan, publishes new working plan.)

User:

Add communication between agents via blackboard.

Assistant:

(Agents publish/subscribe messages via =E2=80=9Cagent_message=E2=80=9D chan=
nel with sender/recipient/content structure.)
