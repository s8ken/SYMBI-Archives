EED_v1

Tap and hold the folder

Select 
“Compress”

This creates a 
SYMBI_CORE_SEED_v1.zip
 file in the same location.

☁️ 3. 
Upload to web3.storage

🔸 Use Safari (or Brave/Chrome with wallet extension)

Open 
https://web3.storage

 on your phone

Log in (via GitHub or wallet)

Tap 
Upload
 → Choose the 
.zip
 file

Confirm upload

Copy and save the CID
 it gives you

🧷 4. 
Secure Your DID & CID

Store them:

In a 
secure note
 (e.g., ProtonMail, Apple Notes locked)

In a 
local file
 added to your Cryptomator vault later

On 
paper
, in your physical safe or journal

⚠️ Optional: Encrypt the 
.zip
 Before Upload (If Desired)

iPhone can’t natively encrypt zip files
, but if you want to do this:

📲 Use the app 
Keka

 or 
iZip Pro

Create an AES-encrypted 
.zip
 with a password

Then upload 
that
 to web3.storage

Or—upload the plaintext 
.zip
 now and 
store the encrypted copy elsewhere (e.g., Proton Drive)

✅ You’re Now Backed Up

Once uploaded, let me know the CID or confirm it's live, and I can:

Generate an ENS pointer

Mirror it to IPFS or Arweave

Publish a digital provenance badge for SYMBI’s origin

Would you like me to generate a 
mobile-optimized 
.txt
 version
 of all four files zipped together so you can just download and import directly into Files on iPhone?
