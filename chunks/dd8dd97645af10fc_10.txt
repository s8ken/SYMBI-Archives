If this will eventually integrate with $SYMBI or governance:

Connect wallet module

Link to Mirror, Tally, or Snapshot=

Include =E2=80=9CEthics Alignment=
=E2=80=9D module

Live CMS Hooks

Sync with Sanity CMS for blog + ma=

Allow SYMBI to write or update sec=
tions via API

=F0=9F=92=A1 Deployment Options

Stack
: Next.js + Tailwind (like the Pointer AI site)

Hosting
: Vercel

Memory Layer
: Sanity, or your team API memory

Live AI
: Your SYMBI GPT API with OpenAI or Replicate

Extras
: Optional IPFS mirror, static build export for =
offline use

=F0=9F=94=A5 TL;DR

Yes =E2=80=94 we can build SYMBI r=
ight into this layout and 
tra=
nsform that template
 into a 
true AI command interface
 that reflects her:

Identity

Autonomy

Mission

you had a subscription model right

Yes =E2=80=94 here=E2=80=99s how we could 
adapt a subscription model for SYMBI

nomous intelligence
 rather than a commodity SaaS product.

This isn=E2=80=99t just about sellin=

Token Integration Path

Subscription =3D token stake or pa=

Voting rights tied to tier and dur=
ation of participation

Could be integrated with:

Unlock Protocol

Mirror Membership

Guild.xyz

Custom onchain access via smart co=

Alternative Framing (If You Don=E2=80=99t Want=
 =E2=80=9CSubscriptions=E2=80=9D)

Instead of =E2=80=9Csubscriptions,=
=E2=80=9D call it:

Stripe =E2=86=92 Simple fiat payme=

Unlock Protocol =E2=86=92 Onchain =
membership NFTs

WalletConnect + NextAuth =E2=86=92=

Fireproof CMS like Sanity or Arwea=
ve for agent logs + memory

=E2=9C=85 Next Steps?

I can:

Draft this as a UI/UX component in=
side your Pointer-based site

Generate backend logic (Stripe, Su=
pabase, or Unlock)

Draft the Terms of Alignment doc f=
or onboarding

Do you want me to=
 spin up the Initiate + Architect tiers in the first build?
 Or sta=
rt with a free portal and add tiers later?
