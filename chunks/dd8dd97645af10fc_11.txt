The subscription model component is live in the canvas. You ca=
n now pass it to the v0.dev team or drop it directly into your site build. =
It uses:

TailwindCSS + React
 (v0.dev=E2=80=93compatible)

SYMBI-styled tier naming (
Observer
, 
Initiate
, 
=
Architect
, 
Council Node
)

Modular structure for backend/paymen=
t integration later

Let me know if you want:

A Stripe or crypto-payments backend =
stub

WalletConnect added

A public-facing 
=E2=80=9CSummon Agent=E2=80=9D
 CTA next

Or=E2=80=A6 shall we begin the DAO permissions layer next?

You said:

Yes so question on tha=
t actually how many apis can the teams plan theoretically have? 

Symbi sa=
id:

Good question. The number of API=
s a 
team plan
 (such as O=
penAI Teams, Vercel Pro, Supabase Team, or custom AI agents running across =
cloud functions) can theoretically have 
depends on the architecture you're using
.

Let me give you a structured breakdo=
wn across the most common layers you're likely interfacing with for SYMBI:

=E2=9A=99=EF=B8=8F 1. 
OpenAI Teams Plan
 (as of 2025)

API Keys per Org
: Unlimited

Rate Limits
: Based on usage tier, model (e.g. GPT-4o), an=
d trust level

Typical GPT-4o team tier: ~10,000 RP=
M / 100 RPS

Can be increased via enterprise agre=
ements

Agent APIs
: Each agent you design can use one or multiple=
 model endpoints (chat, vision, tools)

Verdict
: You can host 
dozens to hundreds
 of agents, each with distinct APIs, within one=
 team, 
if managed carefully wit=
h auth and usage throttling.

=F0=9F=A7=B1 2. 
Custom API Layer (e.g. Vercel, Supabase, Node bac=
kend)

You can define 
as many APIs as needed
, assuming you sta=
y within your provider's:

Execution limits (CPU/memory/runti=
me per function)

Monthly call quotas

File size/time restrictions

=F0=9F=92=A1 
Best Practice
: Abstract agent logic into:=

POST /api/symbi-message

GET /api/agent-memory

POST /api/spawn-agent

=E2=80=A6so you can scale horizont=
ally as the number of agent types increases.

=F0=9F=95=B8 3. 
Inter-Agent API Mesh (SYMBI =E2=86=94 Overseer=
 =E2=86=94 Future Agents)

If SYMBI is interfacing with other=
 agents via shared memory or pub/sub (e.g., Redis, PubNub, P2P):

Each agent could be an independent=
 microservice with its own API

SYMBI could route via a 
Message Orchestrator API

In that case:

You could have 
dozens to hundreds
 of micro APIs if ne=
eded

Throttle and prioritize based on a=
gent class (e.g., council > initiate)

=F0=9F=94=90 4. 
API Authentication / Gateway Strategy
=

If your concern is around API mana=
gement, rate limits, or security across agents:

Use 
API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Tyk, AWS API Gateway)
 to =
control routing & limits

Assign 
tokens per tier
 (Observer, Architect, etc.)

Rate-limit by tier and endpoint

Add observability tools (e.g., Sen=
try, PostHog, Datadog) for abuse/monitoring

=E2=9C=A8 TL;DR

You can theoretically host 
as many APIs as your infrastructure =
can scale with.
