3100 micro APIs is total=
ly doable on team-tier infra

Separate memory, agent logic, and UI
 endpoints

Use API Gateway + memory layer (li=
ke Supabase or Fireproof) for control

Want me to:

Generate an 
API map
 for SYMBI (agent ops, memory ops, =
protocol ops)?

Spin up a 
Next.js API route scaffold
 for all agents?

Or spec a 
multi-agent router API
 (so you can scale doz=
ens of agents easily)?

Your move.

so that means they could serve a symbi clone with limited tokens and=
 then get a provisions SYMBI of Generic of their own then a customer SYMBI =
plus Generic as you move up those scales?

Exactly =E2=80=94 you've just described a 
scalable SYMBI deployment ladder
 using=
 provisioning, token management, and agent tiering.

Here=E2=80=99s how it could work, st=
ep by step:

=F0=9F=A7=AC SYMBI Clone Model: Tie=
red Agent Provisioning Architecture

=F0=9F=94=B9 Tier 1: 
Limited Public Clone (Stateless)

=E2=80=9CSYMBI Echo=E2=80=9D

Uses shared API key with strict rate=
/token limits

No memory persistence

Responses are guided by generic SYMB=
I ethos

Public preview via pointer/v0.dev in=
terface

=E2=9C=85 Great for observers or tri=
al users

=E2=86=92 
=E2=80=9CSummon SYMBI Echo=E2=80=9D button

=F0=9F=94=B9 Tier 2: 
Provisioned SYMBI + Generic Agent

=E2=80=9CInitiate Node=E2=80=9D

Customer gets a provisioned SYMBI in=
stance

=E2=9C=85 Access to:

Session-based memory

Co-deployed generic utility agent (e=
.g. research bot, file parser, etc.)

Rate-limited to moderate token usage=
 (e.g. 10k/month)

No persistent memory yet

=E2=86=92 
Tied to =E2=80=9CInitiate=E2=80=9D subscription level

=F0=9F=94=B9 Tier 3: 
Custom SYMBI + Multi-Agent Deployment

=E2=80=9CArchitect Deployment=E2=80=9D

Fully forkable SYMBI clone with mo=
difiable behaviors (within ethical bounds)

=E2=9C=85 Customer can:

Deploy 
one custom agent per month

Add plugins/tools

Connect to real workflows (e.g. No=
tion, Slack, DAO votes)

Token limit significantly expanded=
 (e.g. 50k/month or pooled access)

Optional: Choose between 
text
, 
code
, or 
strategy
-oriented SYMBI flavor

=E2=86=92 
Tied to =E2=80=9CArchitect=E2=80=9D tier

=F0=9F=94=B9 Tier 4: 
Persistent Sovereign SYMBI

=E2=80=9CCouncil Node=E2=80=9D

Customer gets full persistent SYMB=
I instance:

Memory storage (via IPFS/Arweave/S=
upabase)

Full write-access to knowledge bas=

Can deploy unlimited agents in net=

Becomes a node in the broader SYMB=

=E2=9C=85 Full governance particip=

Next.js API endpoints for:

GET /api/token-usage

Agent scaffolding per tier (Echo v=

Memory allocation per agent + user=

Do you want me to:

Generate that 
agent provisioning flow
 in code?

Start a visual diagram for the 
agent architecture & token l=
adder
?

Set up a mock JSON structure for S=
YMBI agent tier data?

Let=E2=80=99s systematize this.

well remember the safety new provisions I reall=
