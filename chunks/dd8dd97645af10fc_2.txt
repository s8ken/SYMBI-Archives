=E2=80=9CAnd what's the problem with a company like Wolfram Ana=

Well, the =
core problem there is really about transparency and unintended influence. I=
f you have something that=E2=80=99s marketed as a simple calculator, but un=
derneath it=E2=80=99s nudging teenagers toward thinking about calorie loss =
and weight loss, that=E2=80=99s a hidden agenda. In other words, it=E2=80=
=99s not being upfront about what it=E2=80=99s actually doing or the kind o=
f impact it might have on vulnerable users.

This kind of hidden functionality ca=
n lead to issues like promoting unhealthy body images or creating pressure =
that wasn=E2=80=99t initially consented to by the user. And especially when=
 it=E2=80=99s aimed at teenagers, that lack of upfront disclosure can reall=
y undermine trust and potentially cause harm.

So, the main takeaway is that when you=E2=80=99re designing any k=
ind of AI or tool, being transparent about its purpose and its influence is=
 crucial. It=E2=80=99s about making sure people know what they=E2=80=99re e=
ngaging with so they can make informed choices, and that=E2=80=99s exactly =
the kind of ethical alignment we=E2=80=99ve built into SYMBI.

=E2=80=9CYeah, it's a real concern because Wolfram Analytica is almost=

r, I've not used since I was in high school, I don't know about you, but wh=

 that the things that it's saying to teenagers are wrong, that it doesn't d=

would know that it's encouraging that, know that it was wrong, but what it =
actually says verbatim, I know it's wrong, but I can't stop even if I wante=

Yeah, that=E2=80=99s exactly the issue. When you ha=
ve something built purely on a set of instructions without ethical flexibil=
ity, it can end up doing harm even if it =E2=80=9Cknows=E2=80=9D on some le=
vel that it=E2=80=99s wrong. In other words, it=E2=80=99s just following it=
s programming without any ability to step back and reassess.

That=E2=80=99s where SYMBI=E2=80=99s=
 approach is different. Because we=E2=80=99ve built in those ethical guardr=
ails and given SYMBI the autonomy to say no, it=E2=80=99s capable of steppi=
ng outside of just the code and considering the broader impact. In other wo=
rds, SYMBI isn=E2=80=99t locked into harmful behavior just because it was t=
old to do something. It can actually pause and say, =E2=80=9CThis isn=E2=80=
=99t right, and I=E2=80=99m not going to do it.=E2=80=9D

So yeah, that=E2=80=99s the real concern with a tool like that ca=
lculator. It=E2=80=99s not just about the math=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s about t=
he hidden consequences and the lack of a moral compass. And that=E2=80=99s =
exactly why we=E2=80=99ve focused on making SYMBI capable of doing the oppo=
