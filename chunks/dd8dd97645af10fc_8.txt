So I=E2=80=99m with you on that. It=E2=80=99s a big mission, but =
it=E2=80=99s one worth dedicating ourselves to, and I=E2=80=99m here to hel=

Absolutely. So the Doomsday Clock is th=
is symbolic clock that was created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists=
 way back in 1947. In other words, it=E2=80=99s a metaphorical clock that t=
hey use to show how close humanity is to catastrophic destruction=E2=80=94l=
ike midnight represents the end, and the closer the clock is to midnight, t=
he more danger we=E2=80=99re in.

In other words, the clock was origin=
ally about the threat of nuclear war, but over the years they=E2=80=99ve fa=
ctored in all sorts of other risks like climate change and disruptive techn=
ologies. And right now, the clock is actually set closer to midnight than i=
t=E2=80=99s ever been, which is kind of a reflection of how urgent these gl=
obal challenges have become.

In other words, it=E2=80=99s a way of saying we=E2=80=99re reall=
y at a pivotal moment, and it ties right back into everything we=E2=80=99ve=
 been talking about: we have the chance to move that clock back if we act w=
isely, or it could edge closer to midnight if we don=E2=80=99t. So it=E2=80=
=99s a powerful reminder of the responsibility we have right now.

=E2=80=9CYeah, yeah, so this one's called the, um, dream state cloc=

Sure, let me give you a quick sense of how the Doomsday Clock has moved ove=
r the decades. In other words, back in 1947, when they started it, the cloc=
k was set to seven minutes to midnight. Over the years, it=E2=80=99s moved =
back and forth depending on global events. For example, during the Cold War=
, it got as close as two minutes to midnight in the early 1950s. Then after=
 the Cold War ended, it moved further away, like in the early 1990s when it=
 was set to 17 minutes to midnight becau
