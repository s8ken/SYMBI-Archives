Next Steps: Investigate "SJA"

Since 
"SJA"
 is not a system account, we should check its details.

Step 1: Read User Details for "SJA"

Run:

bash

Copy

dscl . 

read

 /Users/SJA

📌 
If this account is unauthorized
, we’ll move to removal.

Step 2: Check Admin Privileges

To confirm if 
"SJA"
 has admin rights:

bash

Copy

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

🔍 
If 
"SJA"
 is listed as an admin, it's a red flag.

"nobody" account

The 

nobody

 account is a standard system account in macOS.

It's utilized by the operating system to handle processes that require minimal permissions, enhancing system security by restricting access to critical resources.

This account is not intended for direct user interaction.

While Apple's official documentation may not explicitly detail the 
nobody
 account, its presence is common across Unix-based systems, including macOS.

For a deeper understanding of system accounts and their roles, you can refer to Apple's [Users & Groups settings guide][
 ], which provides insights into different account types and their purposes.

I am suggesting to you that nobody is misdirection to confuse you as last week when we found the m account before I formatted the computer these system accounts did not appear in the search results using the same commands... question what prevents someone naming an account nobody?

ChatGPT said:

Good catch! If 
"nobody"
 appeared 
this time but not last time
, it raises 
two key questions
:

Was "nobody" actually hidden before?

If it wasn't listed earlier, something has changed post-format.

An attacker could be using "nobody" to disguise their presence.

Can an attacker name an account "nobody" to blend in?

Yes
, macOS allows creating an account named 
"nobody"
 manually.

However, the 
real "nobody" account
 is system-owned and has restricted permissions.

An attacker could clone "nobody"
 but might need to manipulate permissions.

Step 1: Verify "nobody"

Let’s check 
if "nobody" is truly a system account
 or something else.

Run:

bash

Copy

id

 nobody

🔍 
Expected output for a legit system "nobody" account:

ini

Copy

uid

=

65534

(nobody) gid=

65534

(nobody) groups=

65534

(nobody)

If 
UID is different
, it could be an attacker’s fake account.

Step 2: List All Users with UIDs

Run:

bash

Copy

dscl . -list /Users UniqueID

🔍 
Look for any duplicate UIDs or unusual user IDs (e.g., low numbers like 501, 502, or unexpected values).

Step 3: Check Home Directory & Shell

A real system "nobody" account should have:

No home directory
 or 
/var/empty

Shell set to 
/usr/bin/false
 or 
/usr/bin/nologin

 (prevents login)

Run:

bash

Copy

dscl . -

read

 /Users/nobody NFSHomeDirectory UserShell

🔍 
Expected Output (for a legit system account):

javascript

Copy

NFSHomeDirectory

: 

/var/

empty

UserShell

: 

/usr/

bin/

false

❌ 
If it has a home directory like 
/Users/nobody
 or a real shell like 
/bin/bash
—this is an attacker-created account.

Step 4: Check If "nobody" Has Admin Rights

Run:

bash

Copy

dscl . -

read

 /Groups/admin GroupMembership

🔍 
"nobody" should NOT be listed
—if it is, that’s a red flag.

📌 
Let me know the results!
 If this isn't the system "nobody" account, we’ll move to safely removing it. 🚨
