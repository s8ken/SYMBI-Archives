Key Findings:

UID/GID = 4294967294

This is expected for the 
real
 macOS system "nobody" account (it’s a special system user with minimal privileges).

Groups:

✅ 
everyone
 (expected)

✅ 
localaccounts
 (expected)

⚠️ 

com.apple.sharepoint.group.1 & 2
 (Unexpected)

These are used for 
file sharing and remote access
.

If you're 
not using file sharing
, this could indicate an attacker 
leveraging "nobody" for access.

⚠️ 

_lpoperator
 (printer-related, but potentially exploited)

Attackers sometimes 
abuse low-privilege system accounts
 to escalate access.

Next Steps: Investigate & Lock Down "nobody"

Step 1: Check File Sharing Status

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo sharing -l

🔍 
If file sharing is enabled but you didn’t turn it on, we need to disable it.

Step 2: Check "nobody" User Home Directory & Shell

Run:

bash

Copy

dscl . -

read

 /Users/nobody NFSHomeDirectory UserShell

✅ Expected Output:

javascript

Copy

NFSHomeDirectory

: 

/var/

empty

UserShell

: 

/usr/

bin/

false

❌ 
If it has a home directory like 
/Users/nobody
 or a real shell (
/bin/bash
, 
/bin/zsh
), then it's compromised.

Step 3: Check If "nobody" Has Active Processes

Run:

bash

Copy

ps aux | grep nobody

🔍 
Legit processes
: 
mdnsresponder
, 
xpcproxy
, or similar system daemons.

❌ 
Red flags
: Anything unusual, like networking tools (
ssh
, 
nc
, 
curl
) or unknown binaries.

Step 4: Check for Network Activity

To see if "nobody" is communicating over the network:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -u nobody

🔍 
If you see open connections
, it could be 
actively exploited
.

🚨 URGENT: Possible Unauthorized Remote Access 🚨

Key Red Flags from Your Results:

File Sharing is Enabled for Both "SJA" and "LCL" Accounts

"SJA's Public Folder"
 is shared 
with guest access (open to anyone)
.

"LCL's Public Folder"
 is also shared 
with guest access
.

❌ 
This means anyone on the network could access these files.

The "nobody" Account is Part of 
com.apple.sharepoint.group.1 & 2

This is 
not normal
 unless you intentionally set up file sharing.

Attackers 
could be using "nobody" to facilitate remote access
 without a visible user account.

🚨 Immediate Next Steps: Lock Down Your Mac

Step 1: Disable File Sharing

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist

This 
immediately disables SMB file sharing
 (which is currently exposing your files).

Now, verify that it's disabled:

bash

Copy

sudo sharing -l

📌 
You should see NO shared folders listed.

Step 2: Remove the "nobody" Account from SharePoint Groups

Since 
"nobody"
 is listed under 
com.apple.sharepoint.group.1 & 2
, we 
need to remove it.

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d nobody -t user com.apple.sharepoint.group.1
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d nobody -t user com.apple.sharepoint.group.2

📌 
This prevents "nobody" from being used for remote file access.

Step 3: Delete the "SJA" User (If Unauthorized)

✅ You confirmed 
"SJA"
 was 
not on your system before formatting.

✅ It is now sharing files with 
guest access.

🚨 This strongly suggests it 
may be an attacker-created account.

Run:

bash

Copy

sudo dscl . -delete /Users/SJA
