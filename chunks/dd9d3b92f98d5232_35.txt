ent service
 that controls what processes can run and their system privileges.

The logs show 
multiple instances of RunningBoard resolving processes related to AssetCache
, but it states 
"This process will not be managed"
.

This could indicate that the 
AssetCache service is running outside normal process management controls
, which could be 
normal behavior
 or 
potentially concerning
 if unexpected.

Accessory Updater Logs:

There's activity related to 
accessory updates
 (AirPods, Magic Keyboard, etc.), pulling firmware updates from a cache.

It references 
model A2363
, which corresponds to 
AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)
.

Potential Concerns:

If 
you did not enable
 macOS's 
content caching
, but AssetCache is running persistently, 
it could indicate unauthorized activity
.

If you suspect 
malicious network activity
, the system 
constantly failing to detect a cache server
 may suggest that 
it’s trying to connect to an unknown service
.

Next Steps for Investigation:

Check if Content Caching is Enabled:

Run the following Terminal command:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getcontentcaching

If it returns 
Enabled
, but you didn’t enable it, it might be worth disabling:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setcontentcaching off

List AssetCache Processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep AssetCache

This will show any running instances of AssetCache.

Check AssetCache Permissions:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Library/Application\ Support/Apple/AssetCache/

If any unexpected 
users or permissions
 are listed, it might indicate unauthorized changes.

Check Firewall & Network Connections:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -P | grep AssetCache

This will list any network connections AssetCache is attempting to make.

Understood. Let's focus on 
removing or disabling it
 completely since you didn’t knowingly enable it. Follow these steps:

1️⃣ Disable AssetCache Immediately

Run this command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setcontentcaching off

This turns off macOS Content Caching (if it's running).

2️⃣ Check if AssetCache is Running

To see if it's still active, run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep AssetCache

If it returns processes with 
AssetCache
 in the name, let me know.

3️⃣ Kill Any Running AssetCache Processes

If you see active processes, force them to stop with:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill -9 AssetCache

Then, check again with:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep AssetCache

4️⃣ Remove AssetCache from Startup

To prevent it from running in the future:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AssetCache
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AssetCache.plist

5️⃣ Check for Network Activity

Run this to see if AssetCache is trying to communicate externally:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -P | grep AssetCache

If you see 
outbound connections
, let me know.

6️⃣ Delete AssetCache Files

If you're sure you don't need it, remove it entirely:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Application\ Support/Apple/AssetCache
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AssetCacheServices.framework

7️⃣ Restart Mac

Reboot to make sure it's fully disabled.

Let me know if AssetCache is still appearing after this.
 🚨 If so, we may need to dig deeper into system management settings.

Looks like 

systemsetup

 doesn't support that command anymore. Let's do it another way:

1️⃣ Disable AssetCache Properly

Use 

AssetCacheManagerUtil

, the correct tool for this:

sh

Copy

sudo AssetCac
