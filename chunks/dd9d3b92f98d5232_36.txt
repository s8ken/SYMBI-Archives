heManagerUtil deactivate

Then check if it's off:

sh

Copy

sudo AssetCacheManagerUtil status

If it still shows as 
active
, we’ll force-disable it.

2️⃣ Stop and Unload AssetCache from macOS Services

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AssetCache.plist

This prevents it from launching on boot.

Then confirm it's stopped:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl list | grep AssetCache

If 
no output appears
, it’s successfully stopped.

3️⃣ Kill Any Running AssetCache Processes

Just in case, kill all related processes:

sh

Copy

sudo pkill -9 AssetCache

Then, check again:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep AssetCache

4️⃣ Delete AssetCache Files (if necessary)

If you 
never
 plan to use it, remove it completely:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Application\ Support/Apple/AssetCache
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AssetCacheServices.framework

5️⃣ Restart Your Mac

Reboot to ensure the changes apply.

Let me know if it still shows up after this!
