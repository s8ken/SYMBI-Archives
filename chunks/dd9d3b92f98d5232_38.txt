In a Zoom Room, participants can manage various aspects of the meeting, such as muting/unmuting microphones, starting/stopping video, and sharing content, all through a centralized interface.

This unified approach ensures that audio and video are synchronized and managed together, providing a cohesive meeting experience.

Additionally, Zoom Rooms support features like breakout rooms, allowing participants to split into separate sessions within the same meeting for focused discussions, all while maintaining integrated audio and video.
