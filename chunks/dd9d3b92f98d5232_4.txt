fter running this, verify by checking users again:

bash

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

✅ 
"SJA" should be gone.

Step 4: Verify No Open Connections on the Network

Check if "nobody" or any other unusual accounts are actively connected:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i -u nobody

If anything shows up, 
let me know immediately
—it may indicate ongoing remote access.

Next Steps After Lockdown

Reboot your Mac
 to ensure all changes take effect.

Check again for unauthorized users after reboot
:

bash

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep -v 

'^_'

Monitor network activity
 for any unexpected outbound connections:

bash

Copy

sudo lsof -i | grep ESTABLISHED

📢 Report Back:

Does 
sudo sharing -l
 now return 
empty
?

Is 
"SJA"
 successfully removed?

Does 
sudo lsof -i -u nobody
 still show anything suspicious?

If anything persists, we’ll take deeper steps.

🚨 Critical Steps Before Formatting Your Mac 🚨

Since this 
attack is highly persistent
, we must take 
extra precautions
 before formatting. Simply erasing the disk may not be enough if the attacker has implanted firmware-level persistence or remote control mechanisms.

🔴 Phase 1: Secure & Collect Evidence Before Formatting

1️⃣ Disconnect from All Networks (Wi-Fi & Ethernet)

📌 
Why?
 If an attacker has remote access, they may interfere during the reset.

Turn off Wi-Fi:

bash

Copy

networksetup -setairportpower en0 off

Unplug Ethernet cable (if connected).

Reboot into Safe Mode
 (
Hold Shift during startup
) and do the next steps 
offline
.

2️⃣ Audit & Backup Any Logs or Forensic Data

📌 
Why?
 If this attack happens again after formatting, we need data for comparison.

Run the following 
and save the outputs to an external USB drive (NOT cloud storage):

Check for Persistence & Hidden Backdoors

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl list > ~/Desktop/launchctl-list.txt
sudo 

ls

 -al /Library/LaunchAgents/ > ~/Desktop/launch-agents.txt
sudo 

ls

 -al /Library/LaunchDaemons/ > ~/Desktop/launch-daemons.txt
sudo 

ls

 -al ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ > ~/Desktop/user-launch-agents.txt

✅ 
Copy these files to a USB drive.

Check System Integrity

bash

Copy

csrutil status > ~/Desktop/sip-status.txt
nvram -p > ~/Desktop/nvram-dump.txt
sudo ioreg -l -w0 > ~/Desktop/ioreg-output.txt

✅ 
Save these as well—especially NVRAM settings.

Check Firmware Version (Possible EFI Tampering)

bash

Copy

ioreg -l | grep firmware-abi
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep Firmware

📌 
If the firmware version looks wrong (or it’s unsigned), let me know ASAP.
 Attackers sometimes modify firmware to survive reinstalls.

3️⃣ Remove Any Suspicious Remote Access Before Formatting

📌 
Why?
 Attackers may reinstall themselves during macOS setup.

Manually Remove Hidden Remote Access Tools

bash

Copy

sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.RemoteDesktop.plist
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.tftpd.plist

✅ 
This ensures no hidden services survive formatting via remote access.

Wipe NVRAM & PRAM (Persistent Attack Vectors)

Shut down your Mac completely.

Hold Option + Command + P + R while powering it back on.

Keep holding for at least 20 seconds
 (it will chime twice on Intel Macs).

Let go and allow it to boot normally.

🟢 Phase 2: Secure Formatting Process

Once the forensic steps are complete, it’s time to wipe the Mac 
correctly
.

1️⃣ Use DFU Mode for Full Erase (M1/M2 Macs)

📌 
Why?
 Normal "Erase Mac" doesn't remove 
deep persistence or tampered firmware.

If you have an 
M1 or M2 Mac
, follow these steps:

Put your Mac into DFU mode
:

Shut it down.

Hold 
Power Button
 for 
10 seconds
 until you see “Loading Startup Options.”

Plug it into
