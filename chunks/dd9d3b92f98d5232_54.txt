 that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It also includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is useful for managing project dependencies.

Using a Version Manager (Recommended):

A version manager allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js seamlessly.

For macOS and Linux:

You can use 
nvm
 (Node Version Manager). To install 
nvm
, open your terminal and run:

bash

Copy

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

After installation, load 
nvm
 into your shell session:

bash

Copy

source

 ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

Then, install the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js:

bash

Copy

nvm install --lts

Verify the installation:

bash

Copy

node -v
npm -v

For Windows:

nvm
 is not natively supported on Windows, but you can use 
nvm-windows
, a similar tool. Download and run the installer from the 
nvm-windows releases page

. After installation, you can install the latest LTS version of Node.js:

bash

Copy

nvm install lts
nvm use lts

Verify the installation:

bash

Copy

node -v
npm -v

Using Direct Installers:

macOS and Windows:

Download the installer from the 
official Node.js website

 and follow the on-screen instructions.

Linux:

Use your distribution's package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems:

bash

Copy

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

2. Serve the Static Files:

Once Node.js is installed, you can use a simple HTTP server to serve the static files in the 
public
 directory.

Navigate to the directory containing the 
public
 folder in your terminal:

bash

Copy

cd

 path/to/tweb/public

Then, install the 
http-server
 package globally using npm:

bash

Copy

npm install -g http-server

Start the server:

Linux

+1

bash

Copy

http-server

By default, this will serve the files at 
http://localhost:8080
.

You can open this URL in your browser to view the project.

Alternative Method: Using Python's HTTP Server

If you have Python installed, you can also serve the static files using its built-in HTTP server.

Navigate to the 
public
 directory:

bash

Copy

cd

 path/to/tweb/public

For Python 3.x, run:

bash

Copy

python3 -m http.server

For Python 2.x, run:

npm Documentation

bash

Copy

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This will serve the files at 
http://localhost:8000
 by default.

Note:

Ensure that any firewall or security software allows connections to the chosen port (e.g., 8080 or 8000) to access the server locally.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the project from the specified GitHub repository on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository:

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash

Copy

git 

clone

 https://github.com/morethanwords/tweb.git

Navigate to the project's directory:

bash

2. Install Node.js:

The project requires Node.js, which includes 
npm
 (Node Package Manager). To install Node.js:

On macOS:

You can use a package manager like Homebrew:

bash

Copy

  brew install node

On Windows:

Download the installer from the 
official Node.js website
 and run it.

On Linux:

Use your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

bash

Copy

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nodejs npm

After installation, verify that Node.js and 
npm
 are installed:

bash

Copy

node -v
npm -v

3. Install Project Dependencies:

With 
npm
, install the project's dependencies:

bash

Copy

npm install

This command reads the 
package.json
 file and install
