Regarding administrative privileges, it's important to note that any client, whether official or third-party, must adhere to Telegram's API limitations and security protocols.

This means that actions requiring administrative rights within a group or channel can only be performed if the user has been granted those rights by the group's creator or an existing admin.

Simply using a different client does not confer additional privileges beyond what your account has been assigned.

For instance, discussions in the Telegram Desktop GitHub repository highlight that certain administrative actions are restricted based on the user's assigned permissions:

STREAM WITH Option
: 
Only creators can use the "Stream With" option, even if other admins have the "Manage Live Stream" privilege.

GitHub

Adding New Admins
: 
Admins with the "Add new admins" right must be able to add new admins. However, if an admin with this right tries to add a new admin or bot, the app may return an error stating, "Could not add user. Please try again later."

If you're looking for additional features or customizations beyond what the standard clients offer, you might consider 
Kotatogram Desktop
.

It's an experimental fork of Telegram Desktop that includes features like local folders, unquoted forwarding, custom fonts, and wide message bubbles.

However, it's primarily a desktop application rather than a web client.

In summary, while alternative Telegram web clients like Telegram Web K and Telegram Web A offer different interfaces and features, they do not provide additional administrative privileges beyond what your account has been granted.

Administrative rights within Telegram are strictly controlled and cannot be bypassed by using a different client.
