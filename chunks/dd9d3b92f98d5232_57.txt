egarding administrative privileges, it's important to note that any client, whether official or third-party, must adhere to Telegram's API limitations and security protocols. This means that actions requiring administrative rights within a group or channel can only be performed if the user has been granted those rights by the group's creator or an existing admin. Simply using a different client does not confer additional privileges beyond what your account has been assigned.​

For instance, discussions in the Telegram Desktop GitHub repository highlight that certain administrative actions are restricted based on the user's assigned permissions:​

STREAM WITH Option: Only creators can use the "Stream With" option, even if other admins have the "Manage Live Stream" privilege. ​

Understanding "Stream With" in Telegram

The 
"Stream With"
 option in Telegram is a 
privileged feature
 that only 
group/channel creators
 can use, even if other admins have "Manage Live Stream" privileges.

1. What is the "Stream With" Option?

This feature is related to 
Telegram Live Streams
.

Only 
group/channel creators
 can initiate a "Stream With" session.

Even 
admins
 (who have "Manage Live Stream" privileges) 
cannot
 start a "Stream With" unless they are the actual creator.

2. Why Do Only Creators Have Access?

Telegram enforces this 
as a security measure
 to prevent unauthorized admins from taking full control over streaming.

Even if an admin has the "Manage Live Stream" privilege, they 
cannot
 start "Stream With."

This prevents 
malicious admins
 from hijacking the stream.

3. Can This Be Bypassed with a Custom Client?

No.
 The restriction is 
enforced at Telegram’s server level
, meaning:

Even a 
custom Telegram Web client
 cannot override this.

The 
MTProto API
 does not allow a non-creator to access this feature.

This is 
not a client-side limitation
, so modifying a web client 
won’t grant access.

4. Is There Any Workaround?

The only ways to use 
"Stream With"
 if you’re not the creator:

Ask the 
original creator
 to promote you to creator (which is impossible on Telegram unless they delete the group and recreate it).

Have the creator 
manually start
 the stream for you.
