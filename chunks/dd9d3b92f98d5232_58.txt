If you are asking whether 
a modified Telegram Web client
 or 
an alternative Telegram client
 could be installed or used without your knowledge, the answer depends on several factors. Here's how to 
detect unauthorized installations
 and 
ensure your account is secure
:

1. Can a Modified Telegram Client Be Installed Without Your Knowledge?

Web Clients:
 A malicious actor could 
inject scripts
 into a Telegram Web session (e.g., through a compromised browser extension, phishing attack, or MITM attack). However, a standard web client cannot be installed 
permanently
 without your interaction.

Desktop/Mobile Clients:
 Someone with access to your 
computer or phone
 could install a custom Telegram client and attempt to log in 
without your knowledge
 if they have access to your Telegram session or backup codes.

2. How to Check If a Modified Telegram Client Is Being Used

(A) Checking Active Sessions

🔹 Go to 
Telegram App (Mobile/Desktop)
 → 
Settings
 → 
Devices

🔹 Check the list of active sessions. If you see an 
unknown device, location, or client name
, it might be a 
suspicious login.

✅ 
If in doubt, terminate all other sessions and re-login.

(B) Checking Web Client Access

🔹 Open Telegram Web and check 
which web clients you have used.

🔹 If you see an unfamiliar or modified Telegram Web session, 
log out from all web sessions immediately.

(C) Checking Installed Software (Desktop)

On 
Mac
: Open 
Terminal
 and run:

bash

Copy

ls

 /Applications | grep -i telegram

This will list any Telegram-related apps.

On 
Windows
: Open 
Control Panel
 → 
Programs and Features
 and look for 
unknown Telegram-related apps.

(D) Checking Browser Extensions

Some browser extensions can inject modified scripts into Telegram Web.

Open 
Chrome/Edge/Firefox Settings
 → 
Extensions/Add-ons
 and remove anything 
suspicious.

(E) Checking Network Traffic (Advanced)

If you suspect a modified client is 
intercepting
 your traffic, you can:

Use 
Wireshark
 or 
Little Snitch (Mac)
 to 
monitor Telegram’s network traffic.

Look for connections to 
unusual IP addresses or domains
 beyond Telegram’s official servers.

3. How to Secure Your Telegram Account

🔹 
Enable Two-Step Verification
: Prevents logins even if an attacker has your SMS code.

🔹 
Use a Password Manager
: If your password has been compromised, reset it immediately.

🔹 
Check Connected Apps
: Go to 
Privacy & Security
 → 
Connected Apps
 and revoke access to unknown apps.

🔹 
Avoid Third-Party Clients
: Do not log in to Telegram using 
modified clients
 or links from untrusted sources.

4. Final Question: Are You Noticing Anything Suspicious?

Are there unknown devices in your Telegram session list?

Are messages being read, sent, or deleted without your knowledge?

ChatGPT said:

If people can see you on a video call 
without your camera being on
, that strongly suggests 
unauthorized access or manipulation
 of your device, software, or account. Here are the possible explanations and steps to investigate:

1. Possibility: A Virtual Camera Is Running

Malicious software could be creating a virtual webcam
 that streams a feed from another camera (e.g., your MacBook’s built-in camera) even when you believe it is off.

Some video conferencing software allows 
virtual cameras
, and an attacker may have installed one.
