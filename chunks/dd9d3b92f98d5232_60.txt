Based on the output from your commands, here are some insights and next steps:

Telegram Check:

You confirmed that there is 
no Telegram app
 installed on your Mac (
ls /Applications | grep -i telegram
 returned nothing). This is good news in terms of ruling out any obvious Telegram apps being involved.

Safari and Chrome Preferences:

You tried to check 
Safari
 and 
Chrome
 preferences, but the directories for their settings do not exist. This could indicate that you do not have those browsers installed or configured in a standard way. You can manually inspect the app configurations later if necessary.

Cache Cleanup:

You successfully 
removed Google Chrome's cached data
 (
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/Google/
 and 
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/
). This would have cleaned up any residual data associated with Chrome, including any configurations or cookies that might be used for spying.

Network Connections:

The 
netstat
 command shows several 
ESTABLISHED TCP connections
 to various remote IPs, many of which are communicating over 
HTTPS (443)
. These are likely legitimate services like web servers, but they could also indicate connections to services used for surveillance or remote control.

Here’s a breakdown of the 
remote connections
:

104.17.108.108, 34.149.211.227, 104.18.41.158
: These IPs belong to 
cloud services
 (likely from Cloudflare or similar providers). These are typical for web traffic, but they could also represent connections to services used to track or monitor activity.

17.57.145.37, 3.233.158.24, 104.18.32.47
: These are other 
cloud-based IP addresses
, possibly related to various web services or remote access.

Next steps:

Identify suspicious IPs
:

You can use an online IP lookup tool (like 
ipinfo.io

 or 
whois.domaintools.com

) to get details about these IP addresses and determine if any belong to suspicious or unknown services.

Check your router
:

It’s also worth checking your 
router's connection logs
 to see if anything unusual has been going on with your home network. If unknown IPs or devices are connected, this could be an indication of unauthorized remote access.

Secure your Wi-Fi
:

Ensure your 
Wi-Fi network
 is secured with a strong password, and consider 
changing your router's password
 to prevent unauthorized access. If you suspect your router has been
