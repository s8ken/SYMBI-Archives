 compromised, a 
factory reset
 may be necessary.

General Security Recommendations
:

Monitor for unauthorized apps
:

Since you've cleaned up Chrome's data, you should monitor your device for any 
newly installed apps
 that you haven't authorized. Sometimes, apps can install themselves or be disguised with names like "installer" or "update".

Review your Mac's "Security & Privacy" settings
:

Go to 
System Preferences > Security & Privacy
 and check for any 
privacy
 or 
accessibility settings
 that might have been tampered with. Be on the lookout for:

Camera or microphone access

Any apps you don't recognize

System or security preferences that have been altered

Check for System Integrity Protection (SIP)
:

Ensure that 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 is enabled. This feature prevents the system from being modified by malicious software.

To check, boot your Mac into 
Recovery Mode
 (press 
Cmd+R
 during startup) and open 
Terminal
. Run the command:

bash

Copy

csrutil status

If SIP is 
disabled
, you should 
re-enable it
 for extra protection.

Run a security scan
:

If you haven’t done so already, run a comprehensive security scan using a reputable 
antivirus or malware scanner
. Even though traditional AV software may have missed issues in the past, a 
multi-layered approach
 is beneficial when dealing with unknown threats.

What to Do Next:

Check the IP addresses
 to verify the source of the network connections.

Monitor your system for any unusual apps, especially ones that could be controlling the camera or microphone.

Consider securing your router and your Wi-Fi network if you haven’t already.

You might want to 
reinstall macOS
 from scratch if the system integrity is heavily compromised and you can’t track the source of unauthorized access.

:

Change your passwords
, especially for any services that involve personal information.

Monitor your network traffic
 for unusual connections using tools like Little Snitch or Wireshark.

Secure your Wi-Fi network
 with strong passwords, and use encryption (e.g., WPA3).

Legal action
:

If you suspect you're being surveilled without your consent, you may want to 
contact your local authorities
. This kind of behavior could fall under stalking, harassment, or violation of privacy laws depending on your jurisdiction.

Consult a cybersecurity professional
:

A cybersecurity professional can help audit your devices and network for any vulnerabilities or hidden surveillance tools.

Your safety and privacy are incredibly important. If you believe someone is exploiting your personal data or using surveillance techniques without your consent, please reach out to the relevant authorities to help resolve the situation.
