 When looking at the format, there are a few key things to consider:

Meeting IDs
: The repetition of the number sequences in the links (e.g., 
3335656333
, 
3131213313
) could indicate a common pool of meeting IDs being used across multiple shared links. Repeating numbers may be deliberate for ease of access.

Grouping by numbers
: These types of IDs may not always be random and could be manually generated or selected for a particular purpose. The similarity between certain digits, such as those starting with 
333
, could be a way to easily recognize particular meetings (like those linked to adult content) within a larger network of shared Zoom links.

2. 
Language and Text Formatting

The formatting of the text in the provided links also suggests a certain purpose or tone:

Use of all caps
: Phrases like 
ENTER HERE
 or 
SUBSCRIBE
 are written in all caps. This is a common tactic for grabbing attention and creating urgency. It could be a strategy to prompt immediate participation in a session.

Repetitive phrases
: Repeated use of "ENTER HERE" or similar calls to action emphasizes the idea of drawing people into these Zoom meetings, possibly with the intent to engage in adult-themed activities.

Colloquial or informal language
: Phrases like "SHOW ME HOW YOU PЯIMΞ!" or "I LIKE IT WHEN YOU PЯIMΞ!" are intentionally informal and playful. The use of specific characters like the reversed "R" (П) might be a stylistic choice to add emphasis or make the text stand out, but it could also hint at a code used within certain groups, common in online communities where adult content is discussed.

3. 
Emojis

Emojis are prominently used in the text. Let's break down the potential meanings or commonalities:

🤩🤩🤩
 and 
🥳🥳🥳
: These emojis could be used to convey excitement or a sense of celebration. In the context of adult content, this could indicate a party or event atmosphere, which may align with online sex parties or other adult-themed gatherings.

💎
: This could be used to denote something of value, exclusivity, or premium content. It might suggest that the event is exclusive or special.

🔞
: This is a clear reference to adult content or age-restricted material, commonly associated with sites or platforms containing explicit content. Its inclusion here strongly implies that the meetings may involve adult-themed activities.

📷📷📷
: The camera emoji is often used to signify video-related content, which is a clear indicator that the meetings involve video participation, reinforcing the idea of live-streamed sessions.

✈️
 and 
🌍
: These symbols, especially when paired with "LINKTREE" and "TELEGRAM", suggest a networked or community-oriented event. "Telegram groups" further points to the use of Telegram as a platform for organizing or sharing links to the Zoom meetings, common in adult-themed online communities.

Common Symbols

Linktree and Telegram

"VIP" and Premium references
: Words like “VIP” or “exclusive” often surface in advertisements or online communities related to adult content. In this context, it may imply that these are special or invite-only events, further suggesting the exclusivity and privacy of such meetings.
