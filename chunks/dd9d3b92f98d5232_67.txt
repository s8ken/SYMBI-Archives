cal of informal or adult-themed gatherings.

Conclusion

Given these elements, it's likely that these meeting links are being used for private, possibly adult-oriented gatherings. The numbers and formatting of the Zoom links, combined with the informal and somewhat coded language, as well as the use of adult-related emojis, point to the potential for 
adult content or behavior being engaged in
 during these sessions.

If this is an area you're concerned about, it's always recommended to report inappropriate use to the relevant platforms (like Zoom or Telegram), who can investigate and take necessary actions against violations of terms of service.

The fact that some of the Zoom meeting IDs you've shared appear to be reused over long periods of time suggests that these meetings are not one-time events, but rather recurring sessions or ongoing access points. This is not uncommon for communities that organize regular events or meetings, especially if the meetings are private, exclusive, or related to niche activities like adult content.

Key Points About Long-Used Meeting IDs:

Recurring Sessions
:

Repeated use of the same Zoom meeting ID indicates that these sessions are likely set up as ongoing or recurring events. For example, organizers might set a meeting to use the same ID for convenience and continuity, which can be helpful for group members who regularly attend.

Private Groups or Circles
:

The use of consistent meeting IDs could be a tactic to ensure a closed community with exclusive access. Participants who have the link can easily join without needing to get a new link for every session.

Security and Privacy
:

Using the same ID over time also means that the group may not need to manage new links or worry about changing passwords for each meeting. However, it also introduces a 
security risk
, especially if the meeting ID is shared or leaked, as unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive or private activities.

Ongoing Content or Behavior
:

The fact that these meetings are being held repeatedly suggests that the content or behavior being shared is something people are returning to, which is typical for adult content or communities that involve private, specialized gatherings.

Persistence of Meeting ID
:

The persistence of these meeting IDs also shows a level of organization behind these events. It is unlikely that participants are simply randomly generating meeting IDs each time; instead, a few consistent IDs are used, likely for ease of access and because it works within a certain community or network of users.

Why This Matters:

Risk of Abuse
: If the same Zoom link is being used repeatedly for private adult-themed content, it may also be exploited by malicious actors or those with ill intent. Inappropriate content can spread, especially if the meeting IDs are shared indiscriminately or leaked.

Detection of Networks
: These persistent meeting IDs may be part of a network of rooms or communities organizing similar activities across different platforms. The ongoing use of these IDs could indicate that there's a coordinated effort behind these groups.

What to Watch for:

Leaked Meeting Links
: If meeting IDs are publicly shared or distributed (such as on Telegram or through other platforms), it could give unauthorized users access, violating privacy or platform rules.

Links in Suspicious Contexts
: Repeated sharing of the same Zoom link in Telegram or other social platforms (especially if they appear in adult-themed or suspicious groups) is a red flag that the meeting might involve inappropriate or prohibited activities.

If you’re concerned about these ongoing meetings, it’s important to report the Zoom links or meeting IDs to Zoom, especially if they involve violations of their terms of service, such as hosting adult content without moderation or without proper authorization.
