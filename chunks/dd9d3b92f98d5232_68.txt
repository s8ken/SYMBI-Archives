You're right to question how these recurring Zoom meetings with adult content could maintain their same room numbers for so long, especially since Zoom has clear policies about hosting inappropriate content. Here are some possible reasons why this could happen and how you might investigate further:

Possible Reasons These Zoom Meetings Persist:

Zoom's Privacy Settings and Lack of Monitoring
:

Privacy and Security
: Zoom meetings are typically private, meaning that only those who have the link or the correct meeting ID can join. This means that once a meeting ID is shared within a private group, Zoom may not actively monitor the content unless a report is filed. This can make it difficult for Zoom to detect recurring inappropriate content unless someone reports it.

Lack of Action
: If the meetings are not reported or flagged by participants or other users, they may remain undetected by Zoom's moderation or security team. It’s also possible that Zoom has focused on high-traffic or widely-publicized cases and may not have caught these smaller-scale, private groups.

Setting Up Recurrent Meetings
:

Recurrent Meeting Setup
: Organizers of these groups might simply set up recurring meetings (rather than using one-time IDs), where the same meeting ID is reused for each session. With Zoom, recurring meetings are allowed as long as the user has set it up with the appropriate settings (e.g., "No Fixed Time" or "Recurring Meeting with No Fixed Time").

Meeting Lock
: If a meeting ID is locked or has a waiting room enabled, the room can be moderated to some extent, which may keep unauthorized users out. The room’s access could be kept secure, and as long as the meeting link isn't leaked, they may be able to continue using the same ID.

Possible Exploitation of Zoom’s “Join by Link” Feature
:

Convenience
: Many people prefer using the same link repeatedly because it’s more convenient, especially for niche communities that have a regular group of people.

Password Protection
: They may also use meeting passwords, and since those passwords are only shared with a specific group of individuals, it allows for continued access without security breaches.

Manual Modifications
:

Creating New Accounts or Using Proxies
: Organizers might be using a variety of techniques to avoid detection, like creating new accounts regularly to avoid flagged IDs or using proxies to mask their activities.

How to Investigate These Zoom Meetings:

You can take the following steps to investigate whether a Zoom meeting is regularly used for inappropriate content and how it may be continuing:

Check the Meeting ID
:

If you have access to the meeting link (e.g., 
zoom.us/j/{meetingID}
), you can attempt to visit it directly in your browser or app. If it's a recurring meeting, it may show details like the next meeting time or be accessible without a password if it's set that way.

Zoom API
: If you are an authorized user or have access to Zoom’s admin API, you could check the meeting history and the recurrence pattern for any given meeting ID. This would help identify if it is recurring over a long period.

Report the Meeting
:

If you suspect a meeting is being used for inappropriate or adult content that violates Zoom's terms of service, you can report it directly to Zoom. They provide a straightforward reporting mechanism for such cases. You can file a report with details about the meeting ID and what is happening in the meeting.

Zoom Support
: Zoom’s customer support or trust and safety team could investigate whether a meeting is violating their terms, but this requires reporting the meeting explicitly.

Check Social Platforms for Leaks
:

If these Zoom meeting IDs are shared on Telegram, Discord, or other similar platforms, you can manually search these platforms
