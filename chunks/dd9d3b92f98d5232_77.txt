log: runtime predicate failure - invalid predicate:
composedMessage CONTAINS "camera" AND date >= "2025-03-08 13:53:54"
(likely a type mismatch)

It seems like there's an issue with the formatting of the 
log show
 predicate, particularly around the 
timestamp
 and the 
eventMessage
 parameters. The error indicates a mismatch with the types, possibly because the timestamp format you're using is not matching what the log command expects.

Here’s a potential fix:

Correcting the Timestamp Predicate:

Instead of using a complex date format like "2025-03-08 13:53:54," try using the full ISO 8601 format (e.g., 
2025-03-08T13:53:54Z
) as that's typically expected for system logs.

Let's try this:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera" AND timestamp >= "2025-03-08T13:53:54Z"'

 --info

Make sure to adjust the timestamp based on your needs. This format should resolve the type mismatch error.

If the 
log
 command still fails:

If this approach doesn’t work, you might want to try checking if there are logs in different categories, like system logs or diagnostics, or use the 
--debug
 flag for more detailed output. Let me know how it goes!

don't use timestamps use say last 2 hours

ChatGPT said:

To search for logs from the last 2 hours without specifying a timestamp, you can use the 
log show
 command with a dynamic time filter using 
--last
 option.

Here’s the command to view logs from the last 2 hours:

bash

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'eventMessage contains "camera"'

 --info --last 2h

Explanation:

--last 2h
 filters the logs from the last 2 hours.

--predicate 'eventMessage contains "camera"'
 filters the logs that include the word "camera" in the message.

--info
 provides detailed information about the logs.

This should provide you with the logs from the last 2 hours that contain the word "camera." Let me know if this works or if you'd like further adjustments!
