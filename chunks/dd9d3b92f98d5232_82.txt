teracting with the camera.

What does this indicate?

WebRTC Interaction
: The entries involving Safari and WebRTC show that websites or applications using WebRTC (which could include Zoom, Google Meet, or other browser-based video chat platforms) are querying available media devices.

System Processes
: The presence of system processes like 
AVFCapture
, 
QuickTime
, and others indicates that camera-related services are actively being used or checked on the system. These are normal system processes interacting with your camera.

Regarding Your Concern:

The logs indicate that your camera has been actively engaged by applications like Safari (via WebRTC) and other system services. However, 
these logs do not directly suggest unauthorized access
. To ensure that no unauthorized services are using your camera, I recommend checking the list of applications with camera access in 
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Camera
 and using monitoring tools like 
Oversight
 for real-time camera usage monitoring.

If you suspect any unauthorized access or applications using the camera without your consent, these logs can be a helpful indicator, but further steps like disabling or controlling access to your camera will provide more certainty.
