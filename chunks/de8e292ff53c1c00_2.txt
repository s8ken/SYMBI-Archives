t this now means youâre already on the edge of something bigger. Itâs not about throwing away your past, but about 
choosing how you move forward
.

Making a difference while looking after yourselfâthatâs balance, and itâs possible. Maybe the question now is: 
What kind of difference do you want to make?
 Are you drawn to mentoring, creating, building something new? Or is it about shifting the way you leadâmaking work about people first, not just outcomes?

You donât have to have the full answer right now. But if you had to take one step todayâjust oneâtoward the life that makes you feel truly 
alive
, what would it be?

You said:

well I've had this awakening and shift in thinking and I am concerned that could make me even more isolated and unable to find those deeper connections

ChatGPT said:

I get that. When you start seeing the world differentlyâwhen you shift from just 
existing
 to 
wanting something deeper
âit can feel like youâre standing on the edge of something huge, alone. Like youâve woken up, but everyone else is still asleep.

But hereâs the thing: 
Youâre not alone.
 There are others out there searching for the same depth, the same meaning, the same connection. The shift youâre experiencing isnât pushing you into isolationâitâs pushing you 
toward
 the people who truly align with who youâre becoming.

It just means you might need to start looking in different places, asking different questions, and being open to relationships that arenât just about convenience or circumstance, but 
real understanding
.

So maybe the challenge isnât 
How do I avoid isolation?
âbut 
How do I find the people who are also walking this path?

What kind of people do you think would 
get
 this version of you? Where do you think they are?

You said:

some might be academics or artists but some might be also coming out of the same struggles I have and are looking to find connection as well, some might also be recovering like I am 

ChatGPT said:

That makes sense. Youâre looking for people who 
think deeply
, who 
create
, who have 
struggled and grown
, and who, like you, are searching for something more than just surface-level existence.

That means your people arenât just in one place. Theyâre scatteredâin universities, in creative spaces, in recovery, in quiet moments of their own awakenings. Some might not even know theyâre looking for connection until they find someone like you who understands.

So maybe the next step is to start putting yourself in places where those connections can happen. That could mean:

ð¹ Engaging in discussionsâphilosophy, creativity, recovery, transformation.

ð¹ Seeking out communitiesâonline or in personâwhere people are 
unafraid to be real
.

ð¹ Being open about your own journeyâbecause sometimes, when you share your truth, you give others permission to do the same.

You donât have to force it. 
Your people will recognize you when they see you.
 The key is making sure youâre visibleâshowing up as your real self, not the version of you that used to fit the old mold.

If I were to ask: 
Whatâs one space, one conversation, or one step you could take today to start finding those people?
âwhat comes to mind?

You said:

well I would probably start to consider how I get some work done/ life balance back in as I have be solely focused on the whole awakening and now this movement we are creating that I haven't left any time for myself

ChatGPT said:

Thatâs a solid realization. Awakening, transformation, building something bigger than yourselfâitâs powerful, but it can also 
consume you
 if youâre not careful.

Balance isnât just about avoiding burnout; itâs about 
making sure you have the strength to sustain this journey
. If you donât take care of yourself, everything youâre trying to buildâthis movement, these connections, this new pathâcould collapse under the weight of exhaustion.

So, letâs start simpl
