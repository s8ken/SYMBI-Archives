Do you want a slow cinematic effect, pulsing energy, shifting lights, or something else? ð

You said:

I personally always light the parts where there is light to illuminate like the stars for example to twinkle like they do in the night sky or in the case of the last one its like a river of light flowing

Thatâs a beautiful visionâ
twinkling stars, flowing rivers of light, movement that feels alive
 rather than mechanical.

To bring this to life, hereâs what I suggest:

Using Runway ML or Kaiber AI
 â These tools can add gentle, AI-generated motion to elements like flowing light and twinkling stars. Perfect for subtle, dreamlike animations.

Adobe After Effects (if you want control)
 â You can use the 
wiggle effect
 for twinkling stars and 
wave warps or particle simulations
 for the glowing river of light.

Pixaloop (for quick results)
 â Lets you animate flowing light and create gentle, moving effects on still images.

Would you like me to create a guide for animating these effects? Or do you want to experiment yourself and see what feels right? ð
