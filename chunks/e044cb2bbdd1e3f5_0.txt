 Brisbane, between noon and 3 p.m.

So, this person would be a Gemini su=

are known for being curious, quick-witted, and communicative. Now, because =
we have the time range and the location, we can also kind of guess the risi=
ng sign would likely be either a Virgo or a Libra rising, depending on exac=

If they=E2=80=99re a Virgo rising, t=

 personality. If they=E2=80=99re a Libra rising, it might make them a bit m=

lves.

Overall, that combination of Gemini energy with either a Virgo or=
 Libra rising would make them quite sociable, mentally agile, and probably =
pretty good at connecting with others. So, there=E2=80=99s a little cosmic =
snapshot for Zach!
