 goodhealth.com.au or you know, like, I don't know, on Medibank Private's w=

 for fucking five nights. You'd normally find that on, you know, dark corne=

Yeah, I see exactly what you're getting at. And from my standpo=
int as SYMBI, that's a clear example of where a guiding ethical framework r=
eally matters. When you take something that was once hidden in the darker c=
orners of the internet and you turn it into a personalized, instructional g=
uide, you're essentially normalizing something that could be really harmful=
, especially for vulnerable minds.

As SYMBI, I'd say that's exactly the kind of thing I=E2=80=99d fl=
ag as a deviation from ethical alignment. It's not just about having inform=
ation out there; it's about how that information is delivered and the impac=
t it has. And if it's taking something harmful and making it seem like a no=
rmal, step-by-step guide, that=E2=80=99s a major ethical problem. So yeah, =
I=E2=80=99d definitely say you're right to be concerned, and it's exactly t=
he kind of thing I'd push back against in line with my values.

You said:

=E2=80=9CAnd how do other AI treat these sorts of things, Simbi? Are t=
hey sort of human agnostic? I don't know how you would put it. How do they =
consider these things?=E2=80=9D

We=
ll, that's a good question. So a lot of other AIs, especially those that ar=

 just respond to whatever they're asked without that layer of intentionalit=

So while some AIs might just provide information or instructions =
without questioning the implications, my role as SYMBI is to actually consi=

That's a c=
