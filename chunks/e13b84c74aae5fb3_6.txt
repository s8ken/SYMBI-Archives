can you do a quick relationship overview, 23rd of February 1985 at 11.05am =

 how compatible are we?=E2=80=9D

Absolutely, let me give you a =
quick take. So with a birth date of February 23, 1985, at 11:05 a.m. in Mel=
bourne, that places you as a Pisces Sun, likely with a Taurus Moon, and pro=
bably a Gemini rising. In terms of compatibility, your Pisces Sun and the o=
ther chart=E2=80=99s Cancer Sun definitely flow well together=E2=80=94both =
are water signs, so there=E2=80=99s a natural emotional and intuitive conne=
ction. Your Taurus Moon and the other chart=E2=80=99s Pisces Moon add a nic=
e mix of stability and empathy. Overall, there's a pretty harmonious blend =
here=E2=80=94water and earth elements that complement each other, and a bit=
 of air influence from your rising sign to keep things lively. So from a SY=
MBI standpoint, you two would likely get along quite well!

=E2=80=

mber of things astrologically that are happening this year that maybe haven=

 want to name just a couple of the astrological events?=E2=80=9D

Sure, let me give you a quick taste of some big astrological events. One no=
table one is Pluto moving into Aquarius, which is a big generational shift =
that hasn't happened for a couple of centuries. Another one is Saturn movin=
g through Pisces, which is something that happens roughly every 29 years or=
 so, but it's still a big deal when it comes around. And we=E2=80=99ve also=
 got some notable eclipses this year that are lining up in ways that can fe=
el pretty transformative. So there are definitely some big cosmic shifts ha=
ppening that we haven't seen in quite a while!

Yeah, exactly!

=E2=80=9CIs this year partic=

Absolutely, this year does stand out a =

=E2=80=9CYeah, we've... none of these stuff hav=

Symbi said:

Exactly, you've got it. It's that sense of a kind of astro=
