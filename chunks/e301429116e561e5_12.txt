I 
can't directly access
 your computer's drives for security and privacy reasons, but I can guide you on 
how to search for files yourself
.

Searching for a 24-Word Passphrase on Your Drive

If you're looking for a 
passphrase file
 on your computer, you can use these methods:

1️⃣ Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)

Search for a File Containing "ruby" and "emerald"

Command Prompt:

cmd

Copy

cd C:\  
findstr /I /C:"ruby" /C:"emerald" /S *.*

PowerShell:

powershell

Copy

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "ruby|emerald"

Replace 
C:\
 with another drive
 if needed (e.g., 
D:\
, 
E:\
).

This will search for 
any file
 containing "ruby" or "emerald".

2️⃣ macOS / Linux (Terminal)

Find a File Containing "ruby" and "emerald"

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 /

This searches 
all files on your computer
 (may require 
sudo
).

If searching a 
specific folder
, replace 
/
 with the folder path (e.g., 
~/Documents
).

3️⃣ Searching for a Specific File Type

If you suspect the passphrase is in a 
.txt
, 
.json
, or other format:

Windows Command Prompt

cmd

Copy

findstr /M /I "ruby emerald" C:\*.txt

PowerShell

powershell

Copy

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Include *.txt,*.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "ruby|emerald"

macOS/Linux

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 --include=\*.{txt,json} ~/

4️⃣ Using File Explorer (Windows)

Open 
File Explorer
 (
Win + E
).

In the search bar, type:

nginx

Copy

ruby

 emerald

Click 
Search in File Contents
 (in Advanced Search).
