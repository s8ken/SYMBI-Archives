.json
, 
.csv
, or 
.pdf
 file

Inside an encrypted ZIP or DMG file

2️⃣ Search Your Backup for the Passphrase

A. Search for "ruby" and "emerald" in Your Backup

Since you recall 
"ruby" and "emerald"
, try:

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup

This searches 
all files
 in your 
Time Machine backup
 for these words.

Refining the Search

If you suspect it’s in a text file (
.txt
, 
.json
, 
.csv
, etc.), use:

bash

Copy

grep -rilE 

"ruby|emerald"

 --include=\*.{txt,json,csv} /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup

This limits the search to 
relevant files
.

B. Search for Bitcoin Wallet Files in Your Backup

Find Bitcoin Core Wallets (
wallet.dat
)

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -name 

"wallet.dat"

If found, you can try 
restoring and opening it in Bitcoin Core
.

Look for Wallet-Related Text Files

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -iname 

"*wallet*"

 -o -iname 

"*bitcoin*"

This searches for 
files with "wallet" or "bitcoin" in the name
.

3️⃣ Restore and Access the Wallet

If you find 

wallet.dat

, restore it to:

bash

Copy

~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/

Then 
open Bitcoin Core
 and try unlocking it with your passphrase.

4️⃣ Check Your macOS Keychain

If you saved your passphrase in macOS 
Keychain Access
, search for:

Open 
Keychain Access
 (
Cmd + Space
, type 
Keychain Access
).

Search for 
"Bitcoin"
, 
"wallet"
, or 
"passphrase"
.

If found, click 
Show Password
 (you’ll need your Mac password).

what about looking for all my old 'stickie' notes on macOS in a Time Machine backup?

Recovering Old Stickies Notes from a macOS Time Machine Backup

The macOS 
Stickies
 app stores notes in a 
database file
 that you can recover from your 
Time Machine backup
.

1️⃣ Where to Look for Stickies Notes in Your Backup

A. Stickies Database Location

Stickies notes are stored in:

bash

Copy

~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/StickiesDatabase

Your Time Machine backup might have old versions of this file.

B. Alternative Locations (Older macOS Versions)

Older versions of macOS stored Stickies notes in:

bash

Copy

~/Library/StickiesDatabase

2️⃣ Search for the Stickies Database in Your Backup

A. Locate the Stickies Database

Run this command to 
find all Stickies backups
:

bash

Copy

find /Volumes/TimeMachineBackup -name 

"StickiesDatabase"

If found, note the 
oldest version
 (your lost notes may be there).

B. Restore an Old Stickies Database

Copy the backup file to your home folder:

bash

Copy

cp

"/Volumes/TimeMachineBackup/Path_to_StickiesDatabase"

 ~/Desktop/

Replace your current Stickies database:

bash

Copy

mv

 ~/Desktop/StickiesDatabase ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/

Restart Stickies.

3️⃣ Extract Notes from the Database

If Stickies doesn’t load old notes, extract them manually:

A. View Stickies Database Contents

bash

Copy

strings ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/StickiesDatabase

This will 
print all text
 stored inside the file.

B. Extract a Specific Word (e.g., "ruby" or "emerald")

bash

Copy

strings ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/StickiesDatabase | grep -i 

"ruby\|emerald"

If your passphrase was in a Stickies note, this might recover it.

4️⃣ Using Time Machine GUI to Restore Stickies

Open 
Finder
 and go to:

swift

Copy

~/

Library

/Containers/

com.apple.

Stickies

/Data/

Library

/

Open 
Time Machine
 (
Cmd + Space
, search "Time Machine").

Navigate to an 
older backup
 and restore 
StickiesDatabase
.

Restart Stickies.
