mputed hash matches the 
"root_hash"
 in the JSON, the file is valid.

If not, the file has been modified.

Python Script for Verification

This script computes SHA-256 hashes for the given files and compares them against the JSON data.

python

Copy

import

 json

import

 hashlib

# JSON data (replace this with the actual JSON string)

json_data = 

'''<PASTE_JSON_HERE>'''

data = json.loads(json_data)

def

compute_sha256

(

file_path

):

"""Compute SHA-256 hash of a file."""

    hasher = hashlib.sha256()

try

:

with

open

(file_path, 

"rb"

) 

as

 f:

while

 chunk := f.read(

4096

):
                hasher.update(chunk)

return

 hasher.hexdigest()

except

 FileNotFoundError:

print

(

f"File missing: 
{file_path}

")

elif

 computed_hash == expected_hash:

print

(

f"✅

 is valid")

 has been modified!")

Next Steps

Run the script
: Place your JSON data in 
json_data
 and execute it.

Fix mismatches
: If any file hash doesn't match, it may have been tampered with.

Validate Signatures
: If needed, we can also verify the 
digital signatures
 using RSA.

I have the file content. Now, I'll compute its SHA-256 hash and compare it with the expected hash from your JSON data. Let me proceed with that.

Result

'b29af10c62218f948eb299e0c68b176ab1c5ecdfe9813bd957bf2c434e90813e'

The computed SHA-256 hash of the file is:

b29af10c62218f948eb299e0c68b176ab1c5ecdfe9813bd957bf2c434e90813e

This does 
not
 match the expected hash 

45LehOF92Hsuyqz_guy0LJ5X7pM-NiAiWBm6bUxz1HQ

 from your JSON data.

What This Means:

The file 
has been modified
 or is 
not the same version
 as the one referenced in the JSON.

If you expected the file to match, it may have been altered or corrupted.

If the expected hash is encoded differently (e.g., Base64 instead of Hex), I can convert and re-check.

Would you like me to investigate further? 🔍

It looks like the expected hash (
45LehOF92Hsuyqz_guy0LJ5X7pM-NiAiWBm6bUxz1HQ
) might be 
Base64-encoded
 instead of a direct hex representation. I'll decode it and compare it properly. Let me do that now.
