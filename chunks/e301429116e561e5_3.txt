omputed SHA-256 hash
 of your file is:

b29af10c62218f948eb299e0c68b176ab1c5ecdfe9813bd957bf2c434e90813e

These do 
not
 match, meaning the file is 
not identical
 to the expected version.

Possible Reasons:

File modification
 – The contents of 
english_wikipedia.txt
 might have changed.

Encoding differences
 – If the expected file used different line endings (
\n
 vs. 
\r\n
) or character encodings, this could cause hash mismatches.

Truncation or corruption
 – The uploaded file might be incomplete.

Next Steps:

If you have another source of the file, try comparing it.

I can check for 
differences
 in structure (e.g., line endings, encoding).

Do you want me to analyze the file further to see what might have changed? 🔍

yes

I'll analyze the file further by checking:

File size
 – To see if truncation occurred.

Encoding
 – To ensure it's not affecting the hash.

Line endings
 – To check if 
\r\n
 vs. 
\n
 is causing the mismatch.

Differences
 – Comparing against the expected hash to detect possible modifications.

Let me start with these checks.

Analysis Results:

File Size
: 
277,015 bytes
 – No immediate signs of truncation.

Encoding Check
: The file is readable in raw bytes and appears to contain plain text.

Line Endings
: 
No 
\r\n
 detected
 – The file uses Unix-style (
\n
) newlines, not Windows-style (
\r\n
).

Since no major formatting issues were found, the difference likely comes from 
modifications in the content itself
.

Next Steps:

I can:

Extract a 
hex dump
 of the file to compare with the expected content.

Check for 
differences in specific words or lines
.
