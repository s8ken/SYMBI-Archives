The first portion of 
english_wikipedia.txt
 appears to contain 
a list of common words
 rather than a coherent story. It includes frequently used words such as:

Articles & Pronouns
: "the", "of", "and", "in", "he", "his", "they", "she"

Prepositions & Conjunctions
: "with", "by", "from", "after", "between", "under"

Common Nouns
: "world", "city", "state", "school", "university", "team", "film", "war", "government", "family"

Dates & Time References
: "year", "years", "season", "century", "march", "july", "september", "october"

Possible Interpretation:

This 
does not
 appear to be a story, but rather a 
word frequency list
—possibly extracted from Wikipedia or another text corpus.

The presence of "doc", "https", "series", and "film" suggests it could be a 
dataset related to Wikipedia or general knowledge text
.

If you were expecting 
a readable passage
, it might be hidden deeper in the file.

Would you like me to search for

The file still does not contain 
full sentences or paragraphs
—instead, it consists of 
a long list of words
 arranged in no clear narrative structure.

This confirms that 

english_wikipedia.txt
 is not a story but a dataset of frequently used w
