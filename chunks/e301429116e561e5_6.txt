Similar to the previous file, 
each word appears only once
, meaning it is a 
list of unique names rather than natural text
.

Would you like me to compare the two lists for any overlaps or patterns? 🔍 

You said:

so the 'common' words you mention are repeated or not?

ChatGPT said:

No, the "common" words I mentioned 
are not repeated
 in either file. Each word appears 
only once
, meaning both files contain 
unique word lists
 rather than naturally occurring text with repetitions.

If you were expecting repeated words, we can investigate further. Would you like me to check for 
similarities between the two files
, or are you looking for a different type of analysis? 🔍
