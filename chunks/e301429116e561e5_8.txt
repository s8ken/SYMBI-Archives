Full Dataset Analysis

Based on the uploaded files, the dataset consists of 
several large wordlists
, likely used for 
password strength checking
 or 
dictionary-based password cracking
.

1. Overview of the Files

File Name

Contents

english_wikipedia.txt

Common words from Wikipedia or general text corpus 
(30,000 unique words)

female_names.txt

List of common 
female names

male_names.txt

List of common 
male names

surnames.txt

List of 
last names (surnames)

us_tv_and_film.txt

Common phrases from 
TV and movies
 (dialogue snippets)

passwords.txt

List of 
common passwords
 (weak passwords used in breaches)

manifest.json

References 
image.squash
 (which is missing), indicating 
compressed data

2. Key Findings

A. Passwords & Security Risk

The dataset contains a 
passwords.txt
 file, which includes 
extremely common passwords
 such as:

pgsql

Copy

123456

, 

password

, qwerty, letmein, jordan, iloveyou, trustno1, hunter, batman, sunshine, princess, football

If your 
wallet password
 was made from 
common words, names, or numbers
, it might be predictable.

B. Name-Based Password Risk

female_names.txt
, 
male_names.txt
, and 
surnames.txt
 suggest that 
personal names
 are included in password strength checks.

If your password contains a 
name + number (e.g., "Emma123" or "Smith1980")
, it may be vulnerable.

C. TV & Pop Culture Influence

us_tv_and_film.txt
 contains 
common phrases
 from movies and TV shows, such as:

perl

Copy

you, i, to, that, it, me, what, know, 

no

, have, 

my

, just, 

not

, 

do

, be, your

This suggests the dataset might be checking passwords for 
memorable phrases
.

D. Missing 
image.squash
 File

The 
manifest.json
 file references 

image.squash

, which 
is not present
 in the uploaded files.

This means there might be 
additional hidden data
 in a 
compressed filesystem
.

3. Next Steps

Since we have identified the nature of the dataset, we can now:

Search for Your Password
 – If you provide part of it, I can check for matches.

Generate Password Variations
 – Based on your name, birth year, or common patterns.

Look for Hidden Data
 – If you suspect data is missing, we might need 
image.squash
.

Would you like to search for your 
exact password
 or generate 
possible variations
 based on these wordlists? 🔍
