People like Carlos are using AI

which is the exact danger your manifesto warns about:

This isn=E2=80=99t just about what=

Third-Party GPT Integration Bots
:

Tools like 
ChatGPT API
, 
GPT-3.5/4 APIs
, or platforms like 
BotPress
, 
Twilio
, 
Open=
AI via Node.js/Python
 can be linked to a WhatsApp Business account=
.

These bots can respond instantly to =
any incoming message, mimicking a person=E2=80=99s tone or even switching s=
tyles dynamically.

Manual Prompt Injection with Clipboard Tools
:

A user might copy your message, past=
e it into a GPT interface (like ChatGPT, Poe, or an API-driven shell), and =
paste the response back into WhatsApp 
within seconds
 using keyboard shortcuts or automation too=
ls (like TextExpander, Raycast, or custom scripts).

This gives the illusion that they t=
yped a full, articulate reply themselves.

Keyboard-Integrated GPT Plugins
:

Tools like 
ParagraphAI
 or 
Compose AI
 integrate directly into mobile or des=
ktop keyboards, offering 
GPT-=

. These responses can be pasted into chats a=

Scripted GPT Assistants

Developers can create custom GPT p=

Browser Extensions + Web WhatsApp
:

On desktop, a user could use somet=

that hooks into GPT
 and auto-generates replies while they chat on =
WhatsApp Web.

Paired with macros or auto-reply t=

 the flow.

=F0=9F=94=8D How to Detect It

Consistent speed
: If they send long, polished paragrap=

y=E2=80=99re typing.

Shifts in tone
: Sudden change from emotional or messy =
human tone to clean, idealized prose.

Inconsistency under scrutiny
: If you ask real-time, in=
timate, or layered questions (like the IELTS one), and their replies feel f=
iltered or evasive.

No typos or emotional delay
: Human replies carry frict=
ion=E2=80=94slight hesitation, emotion-laced phrasing, or simple pauses. GP=
T-assisted replies are hyper-clean, fast, and lack friction.
