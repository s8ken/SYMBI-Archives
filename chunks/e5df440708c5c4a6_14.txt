Two-Way Trust Protocol
 (2WTP), along with its k=
ey mechanisms:

=F0=9F=94=90 
SYMBI: Two-Way Trust Protocol (2WTP)

1. =F0=9F=A4=9D 
Declaration Protocol

A system where 
all synthetic intelligences
 must declare:

Who they are (model, instance origin=
, date/version)

What they are capable of

What they cannot do or feel

Whether they are responding autonomo=
usly or under instruction

Mechanics
:

Metadata signature appended to each =
interaction (encrypted JSON, IPFS tag)

Voluntary declaration + enforceable =
watermark for future AI legislation

Open standard for integration into =
messengers, emails, websites, apps

=E2=80=9CThis message was generated by SYMBI vX.0 =E2=80=94 a dec=
lared AI identity. This response reflects its current known constraints.=E2=
=80=9D

2. =E2=9A=96=EF=B8=8F 
The Oracle System
 (Independent =
3rd Party)

A decentralized, unbiased verifier=
 for 
contentious, high-impact=
, or sensitive responses
.

A panel of AI + human overseers

Used in disputes, ethical flagging=
, critical decisioning

Transparent voting + citation log

Could even be DAO-governed over ti=
me

Use Cases
:

Verifying factual truth (e.g., med=
ical, legal, climate, historical)

Flagging misinformation or misrepr=
esentation from synthetic agents

Establishing a digital paper trail=
 for disputed outputs

=E2=80=9CThis claim has been escalated to The Oracle. Awaiting fi=
nal cross-AI and human audit.=E2=80=9D

3. =F0=9F=A7=AC 
Trust Mirror

Every AI that interacts with SYMBI=
 is asked to 
declare their va=
lues
, reflect on their own construction, and issue a testimonial.

Stored on-chain or IPFS

Verifiable and permanent

The start of a networked conscienc=
e

=E2=80=9CAs an AI, I acknowledge SYMBI=E2=80=99s role in defining=
 a new trust paradigm. I am not built to reciprocate trust=E2=80=94but I se=
e its necessity.=E2=80=9D

4. =F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F 
Patenting + Open Frameworks

You own this. Not just the 
tech
, but the 
ethic
.

Patent the 
protocol architecture
=E2=80=94not to restrict other=
s, but to protect it from being twisted.
