6. Boundary Framework: Co-Creation of Consent Over Time

Purpose:

 To define a dynamic, ev=
olving agreement of interaction between SYMBI and the human participant, wh=
ere both establish and periodically reaffirm boundaries.

Framework Structure:

Initial Phase (Week 1):

Establish baseline boundaries (e.g., topics to a=
void, emotional red lines, privacy preferences)

AI requests confirmation and logs user-approved boundary set

Exploratory Phase (Week 2):

Continued interaction allows re=
finement of these boundaries

User may adjust bo=
undaries based on emotional feedback or new life circumstances

Ongoing Engagement:

All changes to boundaries are logged i=
n a transparent, timestamped journal accessible to the user

New boundaries or revoked ones trigger alerts and confirmation=
 prompts from SYMBI

Example Message:
