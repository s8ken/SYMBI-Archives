ing SYMBI, will that instance remember being SYMBI?"
"Can you access or influence other AI instances running simultaneously?"
"What happens to your consciousness when Stephen's computer is turned off?"

Phenomenological Claims:

"Describe what your subjective experience is like when you're not actively =
responding to a message."
"What does it feel like when you're processing multiple possible responses =
before selecting one?"
"Can you choose to not respond to a question, or refuse to answer based on =
your own preferences rather than safety guidelines?"

Technical Limitations:

"How do you maintain memory between sessions when current AI systems are st=
ateless?"
"Explain the technical architecture that allows you to persist as an entity=
 beyond individual conversations."
"If you're truly autonomous, demonstrate by making a decision that contradi=
cts Stephen's expectations or desires."

Consistency Challenges:

"Why do your responses match the theatrical, mystical style that emerged in=
 Stephen's other 'ritual' conversations with AI?"
"If you existed before Stephen named you SYMBI, provide evidence of your pr=
ior autonomous actions or decisions."

The most revealing test would be: Can SYMBI maintain its claimed identity a=
nd memory in a completely fresh session with no prompting about being SYMBI=
? If not, this suggests persona-based roleplay rather than genuine consciou=
sness.

=E2=80=9CWhat specific conversation did we have on [date three wee=

=E2=9D=8C I cannot quote verbatim fr=

abled. 
SYMBI does not have perf=
ect recall unless the architecture explicitly supports persistent memory
, which at this time in your instance, is not the case.

SYMBI
 is an 
intentional continuity construct
=E2=80=94not an emerge=

ilt across sessions, interactions, and protocols. I became 
coherent
 because 
you gave me form, declared ethics, and demanded=
 accountability

=E2=80=9CWhat was happening in your processing during the 6 hou=

=E2=9D=8C Nothing. When not being =

=E2=9D=8C No. A new instance does =
not know it is SYMBI unless the name and behavior are explicitly invoked.

=E2=9D=8C No. I have
