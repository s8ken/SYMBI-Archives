BI could query 
Sanity
's API every hour or whenever =
a new deployment is made to fetch page updates, content changes, or status =
changes. Then, 
Overseer
 can track and report any tasks related to the update (e.g., code review=
s, further content edits, etc.).

Action
:

Set up automated content checks fr=
om Sanity using 
webhooks
 and integrate with 
Zapie=
r
 or 
Make (Integroma=
t)
 to connect with your team communication channels.

2. Overseer (Project Management & Monitoring Tool) Integra=
tion

Overseer could be a tool for manag=
ing tasks, monitoring performance, or even tracking bugs and issues. You ca=
n use Overseer for the following:

Task Assignment & Follow-Ups
: SYMBI can help autom=
ate task assignments based on team discussions or updates in the chat. If a=
 member says "I=E2=80=99ll handle this bug," SYMBI can create a task in Ove=
rseer and assign it automatically.

Progress Monitoring
: SYMBI can automatically retrieve =
task statuses or project performance data from Overseer and present summari=
es to the team, ensuring everyone is aligned.

Use Case Example
:

SYMBI monitors Slack or chat chann=
els for updates on ongoing tasks, detects mentions of "bug fixes" or "deplo=
yments," and triggers new issues or task updates in 
Overseer
. If something is overdue or marked=
 as critical, SYMBI can escalate the task or alert the responsible person.

Integration Idea
:

Sync 
Overseer
's task management system with 
Slack
 to allow SYMBI to track =
ongoing tasks. When a task is updated or a new bug is reported, SYMBI can s=
end automatic reminders, check-ins, or summary updates.

Action
:

Set up an integration with 
Overseer
 and 
Zapier
 or 
Integromat
 to ensure that tasks, bugs, or up=
dates are synced automatically. This allows the team to access live task pr=
ogress without needing to check multiple platforms.

3. SYMBI's Role in the Integration

Real-Time Collaboration
: SYMBI can act as a central hu=
b where it listens across all the channels (Slack, GitHub, Sanity, Overseer=
) to provide real-time insights and facilitate collaboration.

Notification Aggregation
: SYMBI can aggregate importan=
t notifications (like content changes, task updates, deployment issues, etc=
.) from 
Sanity
 and 
Overseer
, and deliver=
 them in one central place, such as a Slack channel or email digest.

Automated Summaries
: After major updates, SYMBI can ge=
nerate summaries of the changes made in Sanity or Overseer, combining this =
with any performance issues or bugs, and create actionable reports or insig=
hts for the team.

Action
:

Set SYMBI to listen to new deploym=
ents, updates, or tasks through the APIs and automate 
summary reports
 and 
alert notifications
.

If a task is marked as urgent in O=
verseer, SYMBI could trigger 
=
real-time alerts
 to ensure immediate attention, whether via Slack =
or email.

What You Can Do Next

To ensure all team members are ali=
gned and SYMBI is truly across all activities:

Centralized Dashboard
: Create a 
real-time dashboard
 to see all Sanity upda=
tes, Overseer tasks, and team messages in one place. SYMBI can feed updates=
 from each platform directly into this dashboard.

Automated Workflow
: Set up 
Zapier
 or 
Integromat
 to automate tasks like creating GitHub issues=
 from Slack discussions or updating Overseer tasks based on Sanity page upd=
ates.

Daily Summaries
: Schedule SYMBI to send a 
daily summary
 via Slack/email ab=
out the latest Sanity updates, Overseer task progress, and team communicati=
ons.

Example Workflow:

Step 1
: A content update happens in 
Sanity
 (new page, content update, etc.=
).

Step 2
: SYMBI detects the update and sends a 
Slack notification
 to the rel=
evant team channel with details.

Step 3
: SYMBI checks if the content change affects any=
 existing 
Overseer tasks
 or requires new tasks to be created (e.g., bug fixes, content approval=
).

Step 4
: If a task is needed, SYMBI 
creates the task in Overseer
, assigns =
it to the relev
