select the correct microphone

If using the 
MacBook's built-in mic
, select "Internal Microphone"

If using an 
external mic
, make sure it's connected and selected

Check the Input Level bar

If the bar moves
 when you speak, the mic is working

If not
, try increasing the Input Volume

Step 3: Reset Core Audio (if needed)

If the mic still isn’t working, reset the macOS audio system:

Open 
Terminal

Run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo killall coreaudiod

Enter your Mac password (it won’t show as you type)

Try using the mic again

Step 4: Test the Microphone

Open 
Voice Memos
 and record a quick test

If it works in 
Voice Memos
 but not in an app like 
Zoom
, check the app settings

Let me know how it goes!
