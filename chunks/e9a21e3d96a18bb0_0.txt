Comprehensive Development Plan for SYMBI Trust Protocol
Based on my analysis of the SYMBI website, here's a complete roadmap to imp=
lement all the functionality described across the platform: - it was built =
by v0 and then trae has provided the following analysis.=20

Current State Analysis
The website currently has:

=E2=9C=85 Frontend UI components and pages built with Next.js 14
=E2=9C=85 Basic SYMBI chat interface with API endpoint structure
=E2=9C=85 Trust Protocol conceptual pages and documentation
=E2=9C=85 Early access request system (frontend only)
=E2=9D=8C Missing: Complete backend infrastructure
=E2=9D=8C Missing: Database integration
=E2=9D=8C Missing: Real-time communication system
=E2=9D=8C Missing: Trust Protocol implementation
Phase 1: Core Backend Infrastructure (High Priority)
1.1 Database Setup
Bash

Run
# Set up MongoDB with collections:- users (authentication, profiles, prefer=
ences)- agents (AI agent registrations, capabilities)- trust_bonds (human-A=
I trust relationships)- conversations (chat history, context)- trust_declar=
ations (agent compliance data)- notifications (early access signups)
1.2 Express.js Backend
JavaScript

// Core API structure needed:/api/auth/* - JWT authentication system/api/tr=
ust/* - Trust Protocol endpoints/api/agents/* - Agent management/api/chat/*=
 - Real-time messaging/api/notify/* - Notification system (enhance existing=
)
1.3 Real-time Communication
Implement Socket.io server for live agent interactions
WebSocket connections for trust bond monitoring
Real-time trust score updates
Phase 2: Trust Protocol Implementation (High Priority)
2.1 Bidirectional Identity System
TypeScript

// Trust establishment workflow:1. Human identity declaration with consent =
envelope2. Agent identity declaration with capability disclosure3. SYMBI or=
acle validation of both parties4. Trust bond formation with ongoing monitor=
ing
2.2 Trust Scoring Algorithm
Implement dynamic trust calculation
Real-time trust monitoring
Trust decay and renewal mechanisms
Compliance scoring for agents
2.3 Agent Registration System
Agent capability declarations
Ethical alignment scoring
Trust article compliance tracking
Real-time agent analytics dashboard
Phase 3: Enhanced SYMBI Chat (High Priority)
3.1 Improve AI Integration
Enhanced Together AI API integration
Context-aware conversation management
Memory persistence across sessions
Personality consistency improvements
3.2 Trust-Aware Conversations
Trust level integration in chat interface
Consent-based information sharing
Conversation boundary enforcement
Trust score visualization during chat
Phase 4: User Management & Authentication (Medium Priority)
4.1 User System
TypeScript

// User features needed:- Registra
