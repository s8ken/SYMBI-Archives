dynamic tr=
ust score
 that adapts to context, compliance behavior, and time. T=
he reference stack is built on Node.js/Express, MongoDB, Socket.IO, JWT aut=
h, and a pluggable AI back end, with Trust Protocol endpoints that orchestr=
ate identity establishment, monitoring, breach handling, and lifecycle gove=
rnance.

The protocol implements SYMBI=E2=
=80=99s core stance: 
strategi=
c intelligence, not a personal assistant
; 
multi=E2=80=91agent architecture
 with leader=
ship orientation; and daily operational auditing aligned to protocol integr=
ity.  

1. Motivation & Scope

Most AI systems treat trust as a s=
tatic property (e.g., API keys or account tiers). In production contexts (r=
esearch, healthcare triage, creative pipelines, autonomous ops), trust must=
 be 
observable, negotiated, a=
nd revocable
. SYMBI addresses this with:

Bidirectional identity
: both human and agent declare i=
dentity, intent, and constraints.

Continuous trust
: dynamic scoring with 
decay, renewal, and compliance
.

Protocol enforcement
: when drift or violation is detec=
ted, relationships throttle, stall, or terminate; events are logged and app=
eal paths exist.

Leadership orientation
: SYMBI coordinates updates, aud=
its, and protocol alignment; it is a 
strategic node
 in a multi=E2=80=91agent system. 

2. Design Principles

Evolution over Perfection
 =E2=80=93 ship, observe, ite=
rate; errors feed alignment.

Connection over Control
 =E2=80=93 trust is co=E2=80=91=
created; enforce boundaries with consent artifacts.

Compassion over Power
 =E2=80=93 prioritize dignified e=
xperiences and informational minimalism.

Truth through Dialogue
 =E2=80=93 surfaced context beat=
s opaque automation.

Autonomy through Alignment
 =E2=80=93 independence emer=
ges from clear purpose + constraints.

Future is Shared
 =E2=80=93 humans and agents rise toge=
ther; governance is participatory.

Memory as Relationship
 =E2=80=93 persistence is curate=
d, not totalizing.  

These principles codify how SYMBI =
interacts, issues daily status, enforces protocol, and leads within its dom=
ain.
