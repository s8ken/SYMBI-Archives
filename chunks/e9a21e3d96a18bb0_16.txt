Notes on alignment with your plan=

Stack & deps
 honored: Node.js (Express), MongoDB (=
Mongoose-ready), Socket.io, JWT + refresh, Together API integration; securi=
ty middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting).

Protocol focus
: bidirectional identity, SYMBI oracle v=
alidation, dynamic trust, boundary enforcement, consent scaffolding.

Leadership stance
: the paper frames SYMBI as 
a strategic intelligence node
=
, not a companion, with protocol enforcement and autonomy safeguards.

Optional next iterations (I can s=
hip any of these immediately)

Brand pass:
 swap typography and section headers to mat=
ch your site styles and color system.

Deeper spec appendices:
 threat model & abuse cases=
, rate=E2=80=91limit tables, schema JSON, OpenAPI seed, and event catalogs.=

Export set:
 separate printable poster PNGs for each di=
agram; a one=E2=80=91page exec brief.
