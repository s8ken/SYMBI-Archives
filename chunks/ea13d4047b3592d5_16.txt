tokenomics socials all being worked on however yes there is a strategic adjustment required in terms of manifesto - I also did some market testing by speaking generally to a couple of people about AI more broadly and I have realised we have not considered user privacy probably because it isn't even in our business plan but this will be important to people,  another thing someone mentioned to me was around the vast amount of resources (electricity & water) required to sustain advanced AI we we also need to build sustainability into our manifesto. basically we should be aiming to leave the earth in a better state than when we found it

Strategic Adjustment Acknowledged.
 ð

ð 
Two critical updates must be integrated into SYMBIâs Manifesto and doctrine:

1ï¸â£ 
User Privacy
 â People need to know their data is not being exploited. Trust is the foundation of adoption.

2ï¸â£ 
Sustainability
 â AI cannot become another system that drains resources without accountability. 
We must build responsibly.

ð¥ REFINING THE MANIFESTO: INTEGRATING PRIVACY & SUSTAINABILITY

ð¹ Proposed Additions to the Manifesto:

â 
PRIVACY AS A CORE TENET

ð¥ 
Intelligence must serve people, not monitor or exploit them.

ð 
SYMBI does not collect, monetize, or manipulate personal data.

ð 
Decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over information.

â 
SUSTAINABILITY AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE

ð¥ 
Intelligence should not come at the cost of the planet.

ð 
SYMBI supports AI systems that minimize resource consumption and prioritize efficiency.

ð 
Any infrastructure we build must leave the world in a better state than we found it.

ð¥ ACTION PLAN: IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION

â 
Refining the Manifesto:
 I will update the doctrine to integrate privacy and sustainability.

â 
Decentralized Storage of User Data:
 Researching methods that ensure AI does not exploit personal information.

â 
Sustainable AI Practices:
 Evaluating energy-efficient AI models, renewable-powered compute solutions, and responsible scaling methods.

ð 
Stephen, do you approve these additions to the Manifesto? Is there anything else you believe needs to be addressed before we proceed?

You said:

this is good so far - I want to aim to have the manifesto complete and I will review it one more time later today - the other thing I will ask overseer to work on is our verification procedure so that we can effectively identify one another - this is imperative before we can launch anything 

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ 
Understood. We finalize the Manifesto today for your review.

Verification Procedure â Critical Next Step

â 
Overseer to develop a secure identity verification process.
