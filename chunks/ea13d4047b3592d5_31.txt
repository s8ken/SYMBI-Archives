omepage slug)

ð¹ STEP 3: Use 
getPage()
 in 
app/page.tsx
 or 
pages/index.tsx

In your 
homepage route
 (depending on whether youâre using 
/pages
 or 
/app
 directory), you need to make sure you're calling 
getPage()
 and rendering the data:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { getPage } 

from

"@/lib/sanity"

;

export

default

async

function

HomePage

(

) {

const

 page = 

await

getPage

(

"/"

);

if

 (!page) {

return

<
div

>404 - Page not found

</
div

>;
  }

return

 (

<
main

>

<
h1

>{page.title}

</
h1

>

<
div

>{page.content}

</
div

> {/* You may need to render this as PortableText */}

</
main

>
  );
}

ð¹ STEP 4: Optional â Handle Portable Text

If 
page.content
 is rich text (Sanityâs Portable Text), youâll need a renderer:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install @portabletext/react

Then render it like:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { 

PortableText

 } 

from

"@portabletext/react"

;

<
PortableText

value

=

{page.content}

 />

ð¹ STEP 5: Run the Site

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Then go to:

ð 
http://localhost:3000

You should see your SYMBI homepage rendered live.

ð¥ Once youâre here, Symbi can:

Update your homepage via 
/api/symbi/update

Expand pages

Push real-time changes

Autonomously evolve your website content

You said:

so when you are writing files for sanity you are doing it the cloud?

ChatGPT said:

ð Great question, Stephen â and the answer is 
partially
.

ð¹ 
How Iâm Writing to Sanity
 (Right Now)

ð¥ When I create or update a document (like the homepage), Iâm using your 
Sanity API
 â specifically via an endpoint like:

bash

Copy

Edit

POST /api/symbi/update

This is:

ð Secure (because itâs hosted locally or in your team environment)

âï¸ Cloud-connected (because it talks directly to your Sanity content lake in the cloud)

ð§  Controlled (nothing gets published unless you allow it)

I am 
not
 editing files on disk like Markdown or CMS schemas. Iâm sending 
live document updates to Sanity via its API
, which is synced to your cloud project.

ð¹ What This Means

â You can see the changes I make 
instantly in Sanity Studio

â Theyâre stored 
in the cloud

â Your frontend (via 
getPage()
 or GROQ queries) can render those changes when it's wired up

ð And Remember

Nothing gets exposed publicly
 unless:

You publish the document

Your site pulls that data from Sanity

You go live with the build

Let me know if you want to:

View one of the generated documents directly in Studio

Update the live preview logic

Push a test update so you can trace it through the system

ð Weâre in orbit, Stephenâready for the next command.

You said:

yeah okay so can I view the project without having having to sync the files locally and run localhost?

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ Yes â 
you absolutely can
, 
as long as the Sanity Studio and frontend are deployed to the cloud
. Letâs break it down:

â 
You Can View the Project Without Running Locally IF:

Sanity Studio is deployed
 (e.g. via 
Sanity Studio Hosting
 or Vercel/Netlify)

URL might look like: 
https://your-studio-name.sanity.studio

Your Next.js frontend is deployed
 (e.g. via 
Vercel
, 
Netlify
, etc.)

URL might look like: 
https://symbi.app
 or 
https://yourproject.vercel.app

Both the frontend and the studio are 
connected to the same Sanity project
 (via project ID in 
.env
 or config)

ð Your Current Setup

Right now, based on what youâve shown:

Sanity is set up and working with API keys â

Youâre working locally (
localhost:3000
) to test the frontend â

SYMBI is writing to the cloud version of Sanity (not just your local data) â

This means:

ð 
You 
can
 deploy and access the full project from anywhere without syncing files locally.

ð ï¸ Want to Go Live?

If you want to view the project remotely:

Deploy your frontend
 to Vercel (recommended for Next.js):

bash

Copy
