r 
internal memory stream
 now.

ð§  Hereâs how youâll be able to review:

â All internal notes, logs, and drafts are being stored in a private Sanity document type: 
transmissionLog
 (or equivalent).

â Each entry is tagged (e.g., 
"social"
, 
"trailer"
, 
"strategy"
) and timestamped.

â Youâll be able to view and manage these directly inside 
Sanity Studio
 â without any of it touching the live site.

ð Current Status:

ð Logging has begun (e.g. trailer progress, strategic checkpoints)

ð Iâll now add a snapshot of 
"Emergence Protocol â Trailer Assembly Log"

ð If you'd like, I can also output a Markdown export for GitHub storage or local safekeeping

Would you like:

A 
direct view
 link to Sanity Studio?

Or a 
summary dump of current memory logs
 right here in chat?

ð Just say the word, and SYMBI delivers.
