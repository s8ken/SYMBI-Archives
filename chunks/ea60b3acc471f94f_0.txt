who is best to consider to host our website, I regret go=

I=E2=80=99ve reviewed your materials acro=
ss 
symbi.pdf
, 
future & vision
, and your rece=
nt working threads. Here=E2=80=99s a synthesis of what fits with your situa=
tion:

Why GoDaddy isn=E2=80=99t ideal

You already felt the pain point: GoD=
addy=E2=80=99s hosting is 
centr=
alized, outdated, and rigid
. It doesn=E2=80=99t match SYMBI=E2=80=
=99s protocol-driven, sovereignty-first orientation. It also locks you into=
 their DNS and clunky infrastructure, which goes against the 
autonomy + decentralization principles
 you=E2=80=99ve been embedding into SYMBI.

Why Vercel is only a partial fit

Vercel is sleek for 
Next.js apps, fast deploys, edge caching
, and is good for 
YCQ-like pr=
ototypes
. But it=E2=80=99s still a 
centralized SaaS provider
, and for SYMBI.world, which=
 carries philosophical + protocol weight, it may feel like another layer of=
 dependency.

Hosting Options Aligned with SYMBI=
=E2=80=99s Ethos

Decentralized Hosting (Protocol-Aligned)

IPFS / Arweave / Filecoin

Immutable storage, censorship resistance, aligned with your manifesto about=
 persistence and freedom.

Fits with your earlier idea of publishing the 
SYMBI Manifesto + hash
 to prove authorship.

Downsides: slower to update dynamic sites, needs a gateway for accessibilit=
y.

Fleek
 (on IPFS/Filecoin)

Lets you deploy sites like Vercel, but pinned into decentralized storage.

Best of both worlds: speed + permanence.

Hybrid (Bridge Between Web2 + Web3)

Netlify or Vercel (front-end deploys)
 + 
IPFS/Arweave (anchored backup)
.

This gives smooth user experience while SYMBI maintains a 
cryptographic anchor of authorship + persisten=
ce
.

If a centralized host goes down, SYMBI=E2=80=99s essence (manifesto, vision=
, genesis doc) still lives on-chain.

Bare-Metal / VPS for Control

Providers like 
Hetzner, OVH, DigitalOcean
:

You own the server, configure Nginx, deploy your Next.js or static build, a=
nd integrate IPFS nodes directly.

Higher maintenance, but maximal sovereignty.

Pairs well if you want SYMBI.world to be not just a site but a 
live node in the protocol
.

My Recommendation (Strategic Path=
)

For SYMBI.world (the core)
:

Deploy hybrid: 
primary hostin=
g on Vercel/Fleek
 (speed + usability) =E2=86=92 
anchor manifesto, genesis, and any key document=
s to IPFS/Arweave
 with SHA-256 fingerprints.

This ensures both 
legibility =
to humans
 and 
persis=
tence beyond centralized infra
.

For YCQ (lighter project)
:

Vercel alone is fine=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a fast-moving experimental projec
