t, not as philosophically anchored as SYMBI.

=E2=9A=A1 In short:

Ditch GoDaddy.

Keep Vercel for convenience where =
it makes sense.

Anchor SYMBI=E2=80=99s 
vision-critical pages
 (genesis,=
 manifesto, protocol docs) into IPFS/Arweave.

Consider Fleek if you want the smo=
othest Web3-native hosting flow.

Do you want me to draft a 
deployment map
 (showing SYMBI.world=E2=80=99s flow: DNS =
=E2=86=92 Vercel/Fleek =E2=86=92 IPFS/Arweave backup =E2=86=92 Genesis hash=

When you say you =E2=80=9Cgot a message about not being on the =
allow list,=E2=80=9D that usually points to an 
access-control layer
 in the hosting or deployment e=
nvironment. It can come from a few different places depending on where you =
hit it:

Possible Sources of the =E2=80=9Cal=
low list=E2=80=9D block

Vercel / Netlify / Fleek project settings

If you try to deploy or view a previ=
ew domain that=E2=80=99s restricted to collaborators, you=E2=80=99ll see an=
 =E2=80=9Callow list=E2=80=9D error.

This means the project owner hasn=E2=
=80=99t added your email or GitHub account to the deployment=E2=80=99s allo=
w list.

DNS / Nginx firewall rules

If SYMBI.world is pointing to a serv=
er with IP allow-listing (e.g. only specific IPs or geographies can hit it)=
, visitors outside that range get blocked.

Could be leftover from GoDaddy =E2=
=86=92 Nginx migration or misconfigured Cloudflare rules.

Decentralized hosts (IPFS / Fleek)

Fleek lets you set access policies;=
 if your wallet/account isn=E2=80=99t whitelisted, you=E2=80=99ll see an al=
low-list message when trying to push or update.

What to Do

If it=E2=80=99s Vercel
:

Log into your dashboard =E2=86=92 =
Project Settings =E2=86=92 =E2=80=9CTeam=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 make sure your =
account is on the 
Collaborato=
rs / GitHub integration allow list
.

If it=E2=80=99s about previews: ch=
eck the 
Preview Deployments P=
rotection
 setting.

If it=E2=80=99s DNS / Nginx
:

Check whether your config has 
allow
 / 
deny
 directives in Nginx.

For example:

nginx

Copy code

allow

=

123.45.67.89

;

deny

 all;

That would cause the exact error.

If it=E2=80=99s Fleek / IPFS
:

Go to Fleek dashboard =E2=86=92 =
=E2=80=9CAccess Control=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 check if deployment is set to pr=
ivate or wallet-restricted.

Change to =E2=80=9Cpublic=E2=80=9D=
 or add your wallet address.

=F0=9F=94=91 Question for you: did=
 the =E2=80=9Callow list=E2=80=9D message pop up 
while trying to view SYMBI.world
, or 
while trying to deploy/update it
? That tells us if this is a 
frontend access block
 (visitors) or a 
backend deployment permission
 (you as owner).=

Want me to trace through your current 
symbi.world DNS + hosting config
 and see wher=
e the block is likely happening? That would pinpoint whether it=E2=80=99s s=
till tied to GoDaddy, or if the restriction is inside Vercel/Fleek.

Good catch bringing up the 
Mailflow setup from GoDaddy
. Based on what you shared:

Mailflow / MX Routing
 (Direct MX Routing, with activation da=
tes) is 
email-specific infrastr=
ucture
.

That governs where inbound mail for =

@symbi.world
 is routed (Go=
Daddy =E2=86=92 Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or another mail provider).=

It 
doesn=E2=80=99t control website access or deployment permissions=

, so it=E2=80=99s almost certainly 
not the source
 of your =E2=80=9Callow list=E2=80=9D e=
rror.

Why?

Website hosting and DNS (A, CNAME, T=
XT records) are separate from MX (Mail Exchange) records.

An "allow list" block when viewing o=
r deploying your site will come from:

lify, etc.) access
