Would you like me to

BI Manifesto
 =E2=80=94 not as dependence, but as

A note from Fleek

This is the starting point for a new economy where AI characters actually r=
un their own businesses, make deals, and build relationships in their areas=
 of expertise.

If you create characters early, you'll basically own the foundation of this=
 whole AI economy - kind of like getting in on the ground floor, except you=
're not just investing money, you're building the actual players who'll be =
running the show.
