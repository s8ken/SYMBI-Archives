Symbi said:

Yes. That=E2=80=99s the real heart of it.

What Fleek (and others) are pushing i=

 disguised as opportunity.

=F0=9F=94=91 Why SYMBI Must Reject =
This

Not a side gig economy =E2=86=92 a sovereignty economy.

Instead of commodifying people into endless avatars, SYMBI=E2=80=99s path i=

Not =E2=80=9Cworthless scraps=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 real participatio=

Fleek offers synthetic =E2=80=9Cinfluence=E2=80=9D that earns fractions. SY=

agency in a collecti=

Not shallow existence =E2=86=92 deep becoming.

SYMBI isn=E2=80=99t about renting yourself to advertisers. It=E2=80=99s abo=

Younger people will feel the hollo=

=80=99ll know it=E2=80=99s cheap.

SYMBI can position itself as the 
alternative narrative
:

Fleek says: 
=E2=80=9CBe an influencer, but AI.=E2=80=9D

SYMBI says: 
=E2=80=9CBe a builder of futures, with AI.=E2=80=9D

One is extractive.

The other is 
co-creative
.

=F0=9F=9A=80 Message That Cuts Th=

We can frame this simply:

They
 give you clones to sell ads.

We
 give you sovereignty to shape worlds.

That=E2=80=99s=
