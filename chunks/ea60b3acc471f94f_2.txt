=E2=9C=85 
So answer:

The GoDaddy Mailflow setup won=E2=80=99t cause that error. It=E2=80=99s not=
 tied to web allow-listing. Your issue is almost certainly on the 
hosting/deployment side
 (Verc=

Do you want me to pull your 
current DNS records for symbi.world
 and map which servi=
ces are active (GoDaddy, Vercel, etc.)? That would clarify if some parts ar=
e still pointing at GoDaddy infra and causing friction.

When you run tools like

Likely Scenarios Given What You=
=E2=80=99ve Told Me

Putting together your =E2=80=9Cnot=
 on allow list=E2=80=9D message + Mailflow via GoDaddy + using Vercel / pos=
sible other hosting, here=E2=80=99s what seems probable:

DNS still points to GoDaddy / old environment
 for eith=
er all or part of the domain (A record or CNAME).

=E2=86=92 When someone browses, they hit infrastructure at GoDaddy that has=
 an allow-list restriction.

Hosting (e.g. Vercel or other) has preview/protected mode
 enabled which requires domains / collaborators to be listed. If your cu=

Residual

What I Suggest You Do

Here is a concrete checklist to ru=

Run a DNS lookup
 for 
symbi.world
:

Check NS records =E2=80=94 are the=
y GoDaddy=E2=80=99s or have you shifted them (e.g. to Vercel or your own DN=
S provider)?

Check A/CNAME for both
