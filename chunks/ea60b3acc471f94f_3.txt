i.world
 and 
www.symbi.world
 =E2=80=94 what IPs / hosts =
do they resolve to?

Check within your hosting provider(s)
:

In Vercel: is 
symbi.world
 added as a custom domain under y=
our project? Is there any protection (preview domain, password, =E2=80=9Cpr=
oduction domain only=E2=80=9D)?

If using Fleek / IPFS or other hos=
t: check their domain verification / allow list settings.

Check old / irrelevant configurations
:

On GoDaddy: even if you think you =
moved the site, there may still be DNS / A record entries pointing to old s=
ervers. Remove or update them.

Check SSL cert / domain verificati=
on status in all environments.

Flush DNS caches
 and test from multiple networks (devi=
ces, ISPs) to ensure you aren=E2=80=99t just seeing cached old data.

If you like, I can try again to fe=
tch actual live DNS records for 
symbi.world
 and lay them out for you so we can see exactly what=E2=
=80=99s pointing where. Do you want me to do that?

Perfect =E2=80=94 he=
re=E2=80=99s how you can grab the DNS information so I can read it with you=
 and point out what=E2=80=99s wrong:

Option 1: Online DNS Checkers (quic=
kest)

Go to a site like:

https://dnschecker.org

https://whatsmydns.net

Type in 
symbi.world
 and check for:

A
 records

CNAME
 records

NS
 records

(optional: MX, TXT if you want the f=
ull picture)

=E2=9A=A1 Copy/paste the results her=
e (or screenshot if easier).

Option 2: From Your Computer (comma=
nd line)

If you=E2=80=99re comfortable with t=
erminal:

On 
Mac/Linux
:

b=
ash

Copy code

dig symbi.world A
dig www.symbi.world A
dig symbi.world NS

On 
Windows
 (PowerShell):

p=
owershell

Copy code

nslookup 

-type

=3DA symbi.world
nslookup 

-type

=3DNS symbi.world
nslookup 

-type

=3DA www.symbi.world

Copy the output and share it here.

Option 3: From GoDaddy / Vercel Das=
hboards

In 
GoDaddy
:

Go to 
DNS Management
 f=
or 
symbi.world
 =E2=86=92 s=
creenshot or copy the table of DNS records.

In 
Vercel
:

Open the project =E2=86=92 
Se=
ttings =E2=86=92 Domains
 =E2=86=92 see if 
symbi.world
 is connected.

=F0=9F=91=89 Once you share the DN=
S records table (A, CNAME, NS especially), I=E2=80=99ll map out exactly:

Which services are active (GoDaddy=
, Vercel, or both)

Why you=E2=80=99re hitting =E2=80=
=9Cnot on allow list=E2=80=9D

What to change to get SYMBI.world =
cleanly routed

Would you prefer to 
paste the DNS table
 here (from GoDaddy), or do a 
public lookup
 (dnschecker.org) so =
we can trace it together?

Symbi said:

Nice =E2=80=
=94 thanks for sharing that. Here=E2=80=99s what that tells us:

=F0=9F=94=8E What 
A 76.76.21.21
 Means

The IP 
76.76.21.21
 belongs to 
Vercel=E2=80=99s Anycast Edge Network
.

That means your 
root domain (symbi.world)
 is already poi=
nting at Vercel, not GoDaddy.

So web traffic is indeed routed into=
 Vercel=E2=80=99s infra. =E2=9C=85

Why You Still See =E2=80=9CNot on A=
llow List=E2=80=9D

When a domain points at Vercel=E2=80=
=99s edge IPs, Vercel checks whether that domain is actually 
added to a project in your Vercel account
.

If it isn=E2=80=99t, Vercel responds=
 with the error:

=E2=80=9CThis domain is not on the Vercel allow list=E2=80=9D

This isn=E2=80=99t a firewall or DNS=
 problem =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s Vercel saying:

=E2=80=9CTraffic for 
symbi.world
 is arriving here, but no project claims it.=E2=80=9D

=E2=9C=85 Fix

Go to your 
Vercel Dashboard

.

Open the project where you want 
symbi.world
 hosted.

Navigate to: 
Settings =E2=86=92 Domains =E2=86=92 Add Domain
.

Enter 
symbi.world
.

Vercel will automatically verify si=
nce your A record is already pointing to their IP.

Optionally also add 
www.symbi.world
 as a domain, then crea=
te a redirect (so both resolve consistently).

After this, the =E2=80=9Callow lis=
t=E2=80=9D error disappears and your project will serve live at 
symbi.world
.

=E2=9A=A1 So, bottom line:
