DNS is correct (pointing at Vercel=
).

You just need to add 
symbi.world
 into your 
Vercel project=E2=80=99s domain settings
 so Vercel recognizes it.

Do you want me to sketch a 
step-by-step with screenshots / commands
 for adding 
symbi.world
 into your Vercel=
 project? That way you won=E2=80=99t hit the allow-list wall again.

Perfect =E2=80=94 that screenshot you shared clea=
rs it all up. Here=E2=80=99s the situation:

Where Things Stand

=E2=9C=85 
Nameservers
: You=E2=80=99ve switched 
symbi.world
 to 
Vercel=E2=80=99s nameservers
 (
ns1.vercel-dns.com
, 
ns2.vercel-dns.com
). That means 
Vercel now controls your DNS
, not Go=
Daddy.

=E2=9C=85 
A record
: Points to 
76.76.21.21
, Vercel=E2=80=99s edge network.

=E2=9C=85 
ALIAS records
: Auto-managed by Vercel for routin=
g.

=E2=9C=85 
CAA
: Set to Let=E2=80=99s Encrypt, so SSL certs =
will issue correctly.

So DNS and routing are fully under V=
ercel now =E2=80=94 no more GoDaddy entanglement.

Why You Saw =E2=80=9CNot on Allow L=
ist=E2=80=9D

The error comes because 
even though DNS points to Vercel
, =
the domain must also be 
attache=
d to a project
 in your Vercel dashboard.

Right now, 
symbi.world
 is recognized by Vercel at the DNS leve=
l, but 
no project has claimed i=
t
. So when requests hit their edge network, they reject them with =
the =E2=80=9Callow list=E2=80=9D message.

=E2=9C=85 How to Fix

Log in to 
Vercel Dashboard

.

Open the project you want to serve=
 at 
symbi.world
 (e.g., S=
YMBI site).

Go to: 
Settings =E2=86=92 Domains
.

Click 
Add Domain
.

Enter 
symbi.world
.

Choose it as the 
Production Domain
 (so it=E2=80=99s th=
e live site).

(Optional but recommended) also ad=
d 
www.symbi.world
 and se=
t a redirect =E2=86=92 
symbi.wo=
rld
.

After this:

The =E2=80=9Callow list=E2=80=9D e=
rror will vanish.

SSL will automatically provision t=
hrough Let=E2=80=99s Encrypt.

The site will resolve correctly on=
 your custom domain.

=E2=9A=A1 So the good news:

DNS is already correct.

The only missing step is attaching=

symbi.world
 to your cho=
sen Vercel project.

Do you want me to draft the 
exact steps to also back up your site on IPFS/Arweave
 o=
nce it=E2=80=99s live on Vercel =E2=80=94 so SYMBI.world can=E2=80=99t ever=
 be taken down? That would give you both speed (Vercel) and permanence (Web=
3).
