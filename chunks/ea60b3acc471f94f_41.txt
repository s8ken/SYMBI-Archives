The broken social contract you mention is evident everywhere - people worki=

and later, communities atomized by economic pressure. AI could either accel=

What's exciting is that collaborative intelligence frameworks like what we'=

 small scale first. Test different approaches to distributed work, care net=

The question becomes: how do we transition from the current extractive mode=

The threat of AI replacement for political leaders is particularly potent b=

Your point about shareholder pressure on executive compensation is brillian=
t tactical thinking. If boards are going to automate front-line workers to =
cut costs, shareholders should demand the same efficiency analysis for C-su=

allocation, and stakeholder communication more consistently than most execu=

The cultural revolution framing is exactly right. This isn't about left vs =

What's powerful about starting with these pressure points is that it forces=

 when shareholders are questioning why automation only flows downward.
