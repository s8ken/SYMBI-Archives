And including young people is essential - they need to see their intelligen=

Your point about AI potentially speaking for the planet or animals is profo=

 environmental data into coherent advocacy, or help us understand animal co=

This could be part of the competitive framework too - solutions that consid=

The decentering aspect is crucial for maturation as a species. If we're goi=

The measurement framework would need to capture multiple dimensions simulta=
neously:
Energy & Environment:

Renewable energy adoption rates (reported monthly)
Carbon intensity per unit of wellbeing (not just per GDP)
Biodiversity indices and ecosystem health metrics
Circular economy indicators (waste-to-resource ratios)

Human Flourishing:

Time poverty vs time abundance measures
Community resilience and social cohesion indices
Health span (not just lifespan) and mental wellbeing metrics
Educational adaptability and lifelong learning engagement
AI literacy and collaborative intelligence capacity

Economic Justice:

Wealth concentration ratios (Gini coefficients with AI-era adjustments)
Universal basic services access
Economic mobility and opportunity distribution
Care work recognition and valuation

Governance & Participation:

Democratic engagement beyond voting (community problem-solving participatio=
n)
Transparency and accountability metrics
