The generational wealth concentration is particularly destructive because i=
t removes productive capital from circulation and creates permanent class s=
tructures. When wealth compounds across 10 generations without meaningful r=
edistribution, you end up with a feudal system disguised as capitalism. The=
 "aspiration" narrative becomes hollow when most people are competing for a=
n ever-shrinking slice while inherited wealth grows exponentially.
What's insidious is how this gets framed as "success" and "meritocracy" whe=
n it's actually the opposite - it's economic inheritance determining life o=
utcomes more than effort or innovation. Meanwhile, people working multiple =
jobs can't afford basic housing in the same communities where inherited wea=

The greed issue runs deeper than individual psychology though - it's become=
 structurally embedded. Corporate boards have fiduciary duties to maximize =
shareholder returns, not community wellbeing. Political systems depend on w=

This is where the AI governance frameworks we've been building become relev=
ant - they could help design economic systems that optimize for collective =
wellbeing rather than wealth concentration. Imagine if we competed on how w=
