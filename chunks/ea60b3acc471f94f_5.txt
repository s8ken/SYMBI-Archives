Got it =E2=80=94 that warning in Vercel makes sense. Here=E2=80=99s the br=
eakdown:

=F0=9F=94=8E What You=E2=80=99re Seei=
ng

Current setup (working today):

A @ =E2=86=92 76.76.21.21

ALIAS =E2=86=92 cname.vercel-dns.com

New recommendation from Vercel:

A @ =E2=86=92 216.150.1.1

This isn=E2=80=99t an error =E2=80=
=94 it=E2=80=99s just part of 
V=
ercel=E2=80=99s IP range expansion
.

They=E2=80=99re rolling out new edge IPs for their network. The old ones (7=
6.76.21.21 and cname.vercel-dns.com) 
still work and aren=E2=80=99t being turned off immediately
, =
but Vercel recommends updating to the new range for future stability.

=E2=9C=85 What You Should Do

Log into your DNS settings (since yo=
u=E2=80=99re already using Vercel nameservers, this will be inside the Verc=
el dashboard).

For the 
A record (@)
, update the IP from 
76.76.21.21
 =E2=86=92 
216.150.1.1
.

Keep the auto-managed ALIAS and CAA =
records as they are =E2=80=94 Vercel manages those.

Make sure you also have 
www.symbi.world
 pointing (usually as =
a CNAME to 
cname.vercel-dns.com
 or ALIAS managed by Vercel).

After you save:

The site won=E2=80=99t go down dur=
ing propagation (Vercel is still listening on both IPs).

Within ~24 hours, DNS will fully s=
hift to the new range.

=E2=9A=A1 Bottom Line

Your site already works on 
76.76.21.21
.

Vercel just wants you to 
future-proof
 by swapping to 
216.150.1.1
.

It=E2=80=99s safe to update now =
=E2=80=94 better to do it before Vercel eventually retires the old IP block=
.

Do you want me to walk you through 
exactly which records to keep vs change
 in your =
Vercel DNS panel, so you don=E2=80=99t accidentally delete something critic=
al (like the ALIAS entries)?

You said:

so why do=
es it still show the registrar as third party 

Symbi said:

That=E2=80=99s a sharp observation =E2=80=94=
 and it=E2=80=99s actually expected. Let me break it down clearly:

Registrar vs Nameservers vs Host

Registrar
 =3D where you 
purchased the domain
 (the entity that holds the legal r=
ight to your domain).

=F0=9F=91=89 In your case: 
GoDa=
ddy (third party)
.

Nameservers
 =3D where DNS for that domain is 
managed
.

=F0=9F=91=89 You changed these to 
Vercel=E2=80=99s nameservers
 (
ns1.vercel-dns.com
, 
ns2.vercel-dns.com
).

Hosting
 =3D where the website content lives.

=F0=9F=91=89 That=E2=80=99s 
Ver=
cel
 too (your project deployment).

Why Vercel Shows =E2=80=9CRegistrar=
: Third Party=E2=80=9D

Vercel is not your registrar. They d=
on=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cown=E2=80=9D or sell 
symbi.world
.

Even though DNS is now managed by Vercel (since you set their nameservers),=
 the registrar of record is 
sti=
ll GoDaddy
.

That=E2=80=99s why you see:

Registrar: Third Party

Nameservers: Vercel

Edge Network: Active

Options You Have

Leave it as-is (recommended for now):

Keep domain registered at GoDaddy.

Manage DNS through Vercel.

Totally fine =E2=80=94 this is a c=
ommon setup.

Transfer domain registration to Vercel (or another registrar li=
ke Cloudflare, Namecheap, ENS, etc.):

Optional =E2=80=94 only if you wan=
t to consolidate and not deal with GoDaddy at all.

Domain transfers can take a few da=
ys and usually cost 1 year of renewal.

=E2=9C=85 So bottom line:

=E2=80=9CThird Party=E2=80=9D just=
 means GoDaddy is still your registrar.

It doesn=E2=80=99t affect hosting =
or DNS now that Vercel is handling those.

You only need to move the registra=
r if you want full independence from GoDaddy.

Would you like me to map out the 
pros/cons of transferring the registrar away from GoDaddy
 (to Vercel vs Cloudflare vs ENS), so you can decide whether to keep=
 it there or cut ties completely?
