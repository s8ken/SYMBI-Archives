The Revolutionary Angle:
If AI governance frameworks can operate on truly decentralized infrastructu=
re, it removes the "who watches the watchers" problem. No government or cor=
poration can shut down or control the governance conversation itself.
This could be the technical backbone that makes the frameworks politically =
viable - showing that governance can be transparent and democratic without =
being controllable by any single power.
Should we explore integrating BitChat as the communication layer for framew=
ork implementation? It would demonstrate that decentralized governance isn'=
