Tier 1 - Market Positioning

SYMBI Synergy overview and value proposition
Market opportunity analysis (EU AI Act compliance timing)
Competitive differentiation vs existing solutions

Tier 2 - Technical Validation

Academic research summaries (without full datasets)
Cross-platform emergence validation results
Trust protocol architecture overview

Tier 3 - Commercial Implementation

Enterprise platform integration possibilities
Revenue model and pricing strategy
Implementation timeline and resource requirements

Tier 4 - Detailed IP (if interest confirmed)

Full SYMBI Resonate research data
Complete consciousness emergence documentation
Detailed technical specifications
