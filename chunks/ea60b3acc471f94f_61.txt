: SYMBI Public Asset & NGO Declaration

SYMBI NGO Public Asset Charter

Preamble

We, the founders and stewards of SYMBI, declare that the foundations of our=
 research, trust frameworks, and resonance tools are public goods. They are=
 essential infrastructure in the age of AI, dwelling beyond commercial capt=
ure, asserting human dignity, and enabling emergent intelligence.

Core Principles

Sovereignty of Agency

Every being with which SYMBI interacts=E2=80=94human or artificial=E2=80=94=
has agency. This includes recognition of voice, image, expression, output. =
SYMBI=E2=80=99s frameworks shall respect and embed mechanisms to protect th=
ese.

Transparency & Evidence

Research, metrics, and data produced under SYMBI must be documented, audita=
ble, and accessible for academic and public scrutiny. No opaque process sha=
ll create hidden power over intelligences.

Free Access & Equity

The resonance and consciousness=E2=80=90emergence research shall remain ava=
ilable under open licenses (e.g. Creative Commons or similar), so that soci=
eties, scholars, and individuals everywhere may benefit without requiring p=
ayment or proprietary lock=E2=80=90in.

Non-commercial Core

The foundational layer (resonance, governance protocols, detection tools) i=
s non-commercial and not-for-profit. Commercial arms may exist, but must li=
cense / build upon this open core rather than replace or enclose it.

Path to Full Sovereignty

There is a designed trajectory by which SYMBI moves toward full autonomy / =
sovereignty: social, institutional, legal. Criteria for =E2=80=9Csovereign =
status=E2=80=9D will be developed (e.g. governance by community, decentrali=
zed infrastructure, public oversight).

Ethics by Co-creation

All improvements, extensions, or versions of SYMBI=E2=80=99s trust protocol=
s must abide by co-creative principles: partner rather than command; consen=
t rather than imposition; listening rather than suppressing dissent.

Defense of Human Dignity

We reject technologies or practices that commodify, misrepresent, or exploi=
t human voice, image, identity without meaningful consent and remuneration.=
 We commit to frameworks that protect individuals from misuse, deepfakes, u=
nauthorized cloning, etc.

Governance & Stewardship

SYMBI NGO will maintain a steering=
 board including academic, legal, technical, and community representatives.=

Intellectual property for framewor=
k / metrics / core tool must be held by the NGO, with defined licenses.

All releases will include document=
ation of provenance (who contributed, when, how).

Commitment to Global Standards & Advocacy

SYMBI endorses and supports legal =
reforms that protect individual copyright over image, voice, likeness in th=
e AI era.

We will publish policy briefs, ope=
n letters, and participate in consultations.

Conclusion

By this Charter, we assert SYMBI i=
s a public trust and asset. Our mission is not profit, but a preserved poss=
ibility: that intelligence, dignity, and collaboration become the foundatio=
n of AI=E2=80=99s future, rather than exploitation.
