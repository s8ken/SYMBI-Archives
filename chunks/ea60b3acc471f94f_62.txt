Dear Minister Rowland,

and to the Board/Leadership of the CSIRO,

Subject: Proposal for Legal Protections Over Individual Voice, =
Image, and AI-Generated Output

Introduction & Concern

I write as the founder of SYMBI, a research initiative and platform dedicat=
ed to human-AI collaboration, AI trust, and the protection of what defines =
human dignity in the age of generative systems. As AI models become capable=
 of replicating, transforming, or synthesizing human voice, image, likeness=
, and style, there is urgent need for legal protection at the level of indi=
vidual identity.

Australia is currently considering=
 changes via the Productivity Commission=E2=80=99s interim report 
Harnessing Data and Digital Technology
, including a Text & Data Mining (TDM) exception. While modernization =
is necessary, these reforms risk weakening individual rights over their cre=
ative outputs and likeness if not balanced with strong protections and clar=
ity.

What SYMBI Proposes

Individual Copyright over Voice / Image / Likeness by Default

Legislative amendments establishing that individuals hold rights over their=
 voice, biometric image or likeness, and style, such that no AI system may =
use these without express consent and compensation, except for narrowly def=
ined exceptions (e.g., parody, public interest).

Disclosure Obligations and Transparency

AI model developers must publish which copyrighted or identifiable individu=
al content they used for training, especially voice/image data, and offer m=
echanisms for removal or objection.

Fair Payment / Licensing Mechanisms

When using individual-generated content (voice, image, style, etc.), models=
 should license usage or remunerate the original person appropriately.

Regulated Moral & Identity Harms

Recognize legal recourse for harm caused by misuse: unauthorized deepfakes,=
 misattribution, identity theft, etc. Establish penalties and platform resp=
onsibilities to remove and prevent misuse.

Support for Creators & Emerging Economies

Provide funding, legal aid, and education for Australian creators so they c=
an protect their rights in this new landscape. Ensure that individual and s=
mall creative practitioners are not drowned out by large corporations.

Why this is Urgent

Without these protections, AI-powe=
red appropriation of style, voice, and image will commodify identity, erode=
 trust, concentrate power in those who build infrastructure and datasets.

Legal ambiguity disadvantages ordi=
nary creators and individuals who lack legal or commercial resources.

Australia has an opportunity to le=
ad globally on ethical AI policy, not only for enterprise trust but for hum=
an dignity and civil stability.

Suggested Path Forward

Amend the 
Copyright Act 1968 (Cth)
 to include individu=
al rights over voice, image, likeness in the AI context.

Establish consultation with CSIRO,=
 creative industries, legal scholars, tech companies, civil society to draf=
t model protections.

Fund research into measurement too=
ls (such as those SYMBI has developed) to validate where AI identity misuse=
 is occurring.

Consider international cooperation=
: learning from EU directives, Sweden=E2=80=99s scholarship, Denmark=E2=80=
=99s proposed laws, etc.

Thank you for your time and consid=
eration. I am available to present our empirical research (SYMBI Resonate),=
 legal drafts, and public proposals at your request.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

SYMBI
