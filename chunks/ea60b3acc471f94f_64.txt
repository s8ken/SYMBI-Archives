Would you like me to

yes go ahead I think we have enough content however for now we simple ma=

Symbi said:

Got it =E2=
=9C=85 =E2=80=94 very clean decision. Keep 
symbi.world
 as the =E2=80=9Cbig tent=E2=80=9D (public + =
frameworks + open letter), and let 
gammatria.com
 become the specialized academic wing. That way y=
