You said:

I want to enable both cameras please

ChatGPT said:

Are you referring to enabling both front and back cameras on your iPhone/iPad, or do you mean enabling multiple cameras on your Mac for video calls or recording? Let me know what you're trying to achieve, and I'll guide you step by step!

You said:

the internal one on the Mac, the meet usb one connect and yes also my iPhone continuity camera

ChatGPT said:

Got it! You want to use 
three cameras simultaneously
 on your Mac:

Internal MacBook camera
 (FaceTime HD Camera)

Meet USB camera
 (external webcam)

iPhone Continuity Camera

Steps to Enable and Use Multiple Cameras on macOS

Since macOS doesn't natively support multiple cameras at the same time in most apps, you may need additional software. I'll guide you through the options:

1ï¸â£ Enable the Internal Mac Camera

Open 
System Settings
 > 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera

Ensure the apps you want to use (Zoom, FaceTime, OBS, etc.) have camera access.

Test it in 
FaceTime
 or 
Photo Booth
 to confirm it's working.

2ï¸â£ Enable the Meet USB Camera

Plug in your 
Meet USB camera
 directly into a Mac USB port (avoid hubs if possible).

Open 
FaceTime
 or 
QuickTime
 to see if it appears as an option.

If not detected:

Go to 
System Settings
 > 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera
 and check if itâs listed.

Try unplugging/replugging and restarting your Mac.

Test in another app like Zoom or Google Meet.

3ï¸â£ Enable iPhone Continuity Camera

ð 
Make sure your Mac and iPhone are logged into the same Apple ID with Bluetooth & Wi-Fi enabled.

Enable Continuity Camera

On your iPhone, go to 
Settings
 > 
General
 > 
AirPlay & Handoff

Turn on 
Continuity Camera

Use Your iPhone as a Camera

Open 
FaceTime
, 
Zoom
, or another video app.

Click the 
Camera Selection menu
 (usually in app settings).

Choose your 
iPhone Camera
 (it will appear as "iPhone Camera" or your device name).

4ï¸â£ Using All Three Cameras Simultaneously

Most apps (Zoom, FaceTime, etc.) allow 
only one camera at a time
, so you may need 
third-party software
 to combine multiple video sources:

â 
Option 1: Use OBS Studio (Free)

Download 
OBS Studio

Add each camera as a 
Video Capture Device
 in OBS

You can then:

Display all three cameras at once.

Stream or use OBS as a virtual camera in Zoom, Google Meet, etc.

â 
Option 2: Use ManyCam (Paid)

ManyCam lets you combine multiple cameras in video calls.

You can switch between cameras or show them side by side.

Would you like a guide for OBS or ManyCam? Let me know if you need help with a specific app! ð

You said:

yeah we disabled something as photobooth doesn't see any cams

ChatGPT said:

If 
Photo Booth
 doesn't see any cameras, it means macOS might have 
disabled camera access
 or there's an issue with system permissions. Letâs go step by step to re-enable them.
