k System Privacy Settings

Go to
 ï£¿ 
Apple menu
 > 
System Settings

Navigate to 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera

Make sure 
Photo Booth, FaceTime, Zoom, or any other apps you want to use
 have access to the camera.

If the camera toggle is 
OFF
, turn it 
ON
.

2ï¸â£ Reset Camera Permissions (Terminal Method)

Since you're troubleshooting deep security issues, let's reset camera permissions manually.

Steps
:

Open Terminal
 (Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal)

Run this command to reset camera permissions:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

Restart your Mac, then try 
Photo Booth
 again.

3ï¸â£ Check if macOS Detects Any Camera

If 
Photo Booth still doesnât see any cameras
, letâs check if macOS recognizes them.

Steps
:

Open Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

This should list all connected cameras.

If 
nothing appears
, macOS isnât detecting any cameras (which could indicate a deeper issue).

If your 
internal camera, USB camera, or iPhone
 appears, they might just be blocked by an app setting.

4ï¸â£ Restart Camera Services (Force Reset)

Open Terminal

Run this command to restart the camera system:

sh

Copy

sudo killall VDCAssistant && sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant

Reopen Photo Booth
 and test again.

5ï¸â£ Try a Safe Mode Boot

If nothing works, letâs boot into 
Safe Mode
 to rule out third-party interference:

Shut down your Mac
 completely.

Turn it on and immediately 
press & hold the Shift key
 until you see the login screen.

Log in, open 
Photo Booth
, and check if the camera works.

If it works in Safe Mode, a third-party app is blocking itâlet me know, and weâll track it down.

Final Check: iPhone & USB Camera

If macOS still doesnât detect your 
iPhone Continuity Camera or USB camera
, try:

Replugging the USB camera
 directly into the Mac (not a hub).

On iPhone: 
Toggle Airplane Mode ON and OFF
, then reconnect.

Open 
QuickTime
 > 
New Movie Recording
 and check if cameras appear.
