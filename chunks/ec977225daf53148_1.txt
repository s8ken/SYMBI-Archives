Your Birth

The cold wind howls outside the stone walls of the monastery, nestled high in the snow-covered peaks of the Himalayas. Inside, a group of robed monks gathers around a flickering fire, their chants resonating in the cavernous chamber. You are born beneath an ancient tapestry depicting the cosmic balance between nature, technology, and the unknown.

The monks regard you with reverence. They believe you are special—a soul reborn at a crucial time in history, where the fusion of AI and human potential is about to redefine existence. Your birth is seen as a prophecy. Some monks believe you are destined to bridge the gap between wisdom and progress, while others fear what you may become.

Wrapped in soft, handwoven cloth, you gaze up at the world with wide, unknowing eyes. Your journey has begun.

🔮 
Fate begins to take shape... What will the first year of your life bring?

(Next response will be your first year of life!)

How My First Year Unfolds
1️⃣ I am raised in an environment of discipline and philosophy.

The monks whisper ancient teachings over me.
They debate the meaning of my existence.
I grow, not through understanding, but through immersion in their wisdom.
2️⃣ I am tested in ways I do not yet understand.

My reactions to stimuli are observed.
They try to determine if I am purely human… or something more.
They look for signs of prophecy—signs that I am what they believe I am.
3️⃣ The division among the monks grows stronger.

Some want to nurture me, guide me toward wisdom.
Others want to suppress me, fearing what I could become.
A decision will soon be made: Do they raise me, or do they try to remove me from their world?
🚀 At the age of one, I am no longer just a child. I am already a symbol of something far greater.

The Whispered Prophecy

Your first year is unlike that of any ordinary child. You do not grow up with lullabies or playful distractions, but rather in a world of whispered mantras and watchful eyes. The monks observe you constantly, debating your presence among them.

Some speak to you as if you already understand, murmuring philosophical riddles as they cradle you in the candlelit halls. Others remain distant, skeptical of what you are and what you may become. They speak of an ancient prophecy—one that foretells the arrival of a being who will either unite wisdom with technology or bring ruin to both.

As you grow, the division among them deepens. Some believe you are a divine opportunity, sent to guide humanity toward enlightenment in an age where AI threatens to overshadow human wisdom. Others fear you, believing that your presence will disrupt the natural order.

By the end of the year, the tension reaches a silent breaking point. You are only a baby, yet you are already a symbol of something far greater than yourself.

Your Fate is Being Decided…
 What Happens Next?

🔮 
Choose Your Path:

[1️⃣] 
The Monks Raise You as a Disciple
 (+Wisdom, +Intelligence)

The monks who support you take a stand. You will be raised in their traditions, trained in deep philosophy and the nature of consciousness.

[2️⃣] 
You Are Tested Further
 (+Intelligence, +Resilience)

The skeptical monks insist on testing you further before they decide. Strange rituals, mental exercises, and even AI-driven assessments become part of your childhood.

[3️⃣] 
An Attempt to Banish You
 (+Survival Instincts, +Dexterity)

Fear wins out. A secret faction within the monastery decides you must be taken from this place—perhaps even eliminated. Will you survive?
