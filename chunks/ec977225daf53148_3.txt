ike polished obsidian, leans close and whispers:

"The dream world is where truth and illusion meet. Step carefully, child."

You close your eyes.

The Descent Into the Mind

You do not know when sleep takes you. The chanting seems to continue, echoing in the vastness of your subconscious. But soon, you are no longer in the monastery.

🔥 
The River of Time

You stand at the edge of a vast river. The water moves in strange directions—some currents flowing forward, others backward. The monks told you that dreams reveal the truth of one’s nature. Do you step into the river?

🔥 
The Mirror of Faces

A stone monolith rises before you, its surface a shifting mass of reflections—your face, but not only as you are now. You see yourself as an old sage, as a warrior, as something... inhuman. The faces blur, showing glimpses of possibilities. Who are you meant to be?

🔥 
The Voice in the Void

As you wander deeper, a voice calls your name from the darkness. It is neither human nor mechanical—it is something beyond both. It asks, 
"Are you the bridge, or the blade?"

You do not answer.

The Awakening

Your eyes snap open. Hours have passed, yet it feels like mere moments. The monks watch you in silence. They see something different in you now—something that cannot be put into words.

The eldest monk leans forward.

"What did you see?"

You do not know how to explain it, but you feel changed. A new awareness stirs within you. The monks murmur among themselves—some in awe, some in fear.

One thing is certain: you are no longer just a child.

The Path of the Dreamwalker

From the moment you awaken from the Dream Trial, your place in the monastery changes. You are no longer just a child under observation—you are a seeker, a student of the unseen.

The monks who once doubted you now watch with wary respect. Even those who feared you cannot deny the way your presence has begun to shift the energy of the monastery.

🔥 
Learning to Interpret the Unseen

You are taught to meditate deeply, to enter the realm between waking and sleep at will. The visions come more frequently now—symbols, voices, glimpses of possible futures. The monks teach you to listen, to observe without judgment.

🔥 
The Test of Influence

A visiting monk from a distant monastery challenges you. He believes you are simply a child with an overactive imagination. He asks you to describe a dream—one you have not yet had—and then, that night, he sits in deep meditation, attempting to witness the same dream himself.
