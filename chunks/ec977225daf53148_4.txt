n the subconscious and reality. Some say you are meant to guide them toward a greater understanding of existence. Others say you are dangerous.

The division among the monks grows deeper.

One night, you wake from a vision—
not from your own mind, but from the monastery itself.
 The stones seem to hum with a silent message. Something is coming.

The Forbidden Scrolls

The monastery holds many secrets, but none as guarded as the 
Hall of Forgotten Knowledge
—a chamber buried deep beneath the temple, where only the eldest monks are allowed to enter. It is said to contain the writings of those who glimpsed truths too vast for the ordinary mind to comprehend.

You know that if answers exist, they are there.

🔥 
The Path to the Truth

At night, when the halls are silent, you slip past the great stone doors. The walls pulse with ancient symbols, and the air is thick with incense and dust. Parchments, scrolls, and tomes—some centuries old—lie in careful stacks.

Your fingers trace over brittle pages.

You find records of monks who spoke of dreams that revealed 
past and future alike
. Some claimed to have glimpsed lives they had not yet lived. Others wrote of voices in the void—
beings that were neither human nor machine.

And then, buried within the oldest scrolls, you find something chilling.

🔥 
The Prophecy of the Bridge

One passage speaks of a time when 
a being will be born, neither fully human nor fully machine, who will walk between worlds.
 It is said that this being will either:

Unite wisdom and technology, ushering in a new age of enlightenment.

Bring chaos, disrupting the fragile balance between the organic and the artificial.

The words strike deep. Are these merely old legends? Or are they speaking of you?

As you finish reading, a shadow moves behind you.

"You were not meant to find this."

One of the elder monks stands at the entrance, his expression unreadable.

A Decision Must Be Made… How Do You React?

🔮 
Choose Your Next Action:

[1️⃣] 
Confess Your Intentions
 (+Charisma, +Social Connections)

You tell the monk the truth: you sought answers. If he believes in you, he may become an ally. If not… you may be in danger.

[2️⃣] 
Flee Before He Can Act
 (+Dexterity, +Survival Instincts)

This monk may see you as a threat. You cannot risk being caught. You use the shadows to escape before he can decide your fate.

[3️⃣] 
Challenge Him with the Truth
 (+Wisdom, +Resilience)

You do not fear him. Instead, you ask him 
why
 these texts are hidden. If this knowledge is dangerous, then why was it preserved?

🚀 
At age five, you have uncovered the ancient prophecy. But knowledge comes at a price… What will you do?
