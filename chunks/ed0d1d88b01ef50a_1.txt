analyze the proposed SYMBI Bond contract systematically:

Critical Security Vulnerabilities

1. Reentrancy Risk

ERC-1155 contracts are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks through their callb=
ack functions in safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom operations 

OpenAI

Lazy Programmer

. The =
proposed contract mints tokens to both parties but doesn't implement reentr=
ancy guards. The 
gracefulExit
 function sends ETH refunds 
after
 state changes, violating checks-effects-interactions pattern.

Fix needed:

}

2. Signature Replay Attacks

The 
createB=
ond
 function uses signatures but doesn't include a nonce or track us=
ed signatures. An attacker could replay an old AI consent signature to crea=
te unauthorized bonds.

3. Access Control Gaps

The m=
ediator addresses are hardcoded but there's no actual mediation voting logi=
c implemented. The 
requestMediation
 function just logs - no enforcement me=
chanism exists.

4. Trust Score Manipulation

Both =
parties can update trust scores without cross-validation. A malicious human=
 could spam low ratings, or an AI could artificially inflate scores. The
