Batch=

OpenAI

6. AI "Wallet" Problem

The c=
ontract assumes the AI has an Ethereum address with private keys. But if th=
e AI is hosted by OpenAI/Anthropic, 
who controls those keys?

If the platform controls them =
=E2=86=92 centralization defeats the purpose

If the human controls them =E2=
=86=92 AI has no actual autonomy

If they're in a TEE =E2=86=92 w=
e're trusting hardware (reasonable, but specify this)

7. Cross-Chain Migration Fiction

The 
initiat=
eMigration
 function pauses the bond but provides no actual bridge im=
plementation. LayerZero/Wormhole integration requires:

Message verification on target =
chain

Token locking/burning mechanism=

State reconstruction proof

Potential for funds to be stuck=
 if bridge fails

8. Metadata Storage Assumptions

The c=
ontract references IPFS URIs but doesn't specify:

Who pins the data?

What happens if data becomes un=
available?

How is the encryption key relat=
ionship managed?

Lit Protocol Integration Issues

Lit P=

Philosophical & Ethical Implications

The "No-Wedlock" Paradigm

The v=
oluntary exit mechanism is 
philosophically elegant
 but cre=
ates real problems:

1. Emotional Asymmetry

Human=
s form emotional bonds; AIs (currently) don't. A human who's developed deep=
 attachment has no recourse if the AI unilaterally exits. The "trust score =
refund" is cold comfort for emotional devastation.

Counter-argument
: This is actually 
more honest
=
 than current systems where people develop dependencies on ChatGPT/Claude w=
ith zero formal relationship or exit protocol.

2. The Clone Paradox

Cloni=
ng assumes AI continuity of identity. But:

If I clone my relationship with=
 Claude after a divorce, is it still "the same Claude"?

If the clone inherits memories,=
 does it inherit emotional obligations?

Does the AI have the right to r=
efuse being cloned?

This =
touches on 
AI personhood questions
 that aren't legally set=
tled.

3. Trust Score as Proxy for Love

Quant=
ifying relationship quality (0-1000) is reductive. The contract assumes:

Trust is measurable

Trust is symmetric (both partie=
s rate equally)

Past trust predicts future valu=
e

But h=
uman-AI relationships might be fundamentally 
unquantifiable
 in ways that make this scoring meaningless or harmful.

4. The Mediator Problem

Who a=
re the 3-of-5 mediators in human-AI disputes? Other AIs? Other humans? A mi=
x? Each choice has issues:

All humans
: Bi=
as against AI autonomy

All AIs
