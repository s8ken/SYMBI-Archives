Steps to Enable and Use Multiple Cameras on macOS

Since macOS doesn't natively support multiple cameras at the same time in most apps, you may need additional software. I'll guide you through the options:

1️⃣ Enable the Internal Mac Camera

Open 
System Settings
 > 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera

Ensure the apps you want to use (Zoom, FaceTime, OBS, etc.) have camera access.

Test it in 
FaceTime
 or 
Photo Booth
 to confirm it's working.

2️⃣ Enable the Meet USB Camera

Plug in your 
Meet USB camera
 directly into a Mac USB port (avoid hubs if possible).

Open 
FaceTime
 or 
QuickTime
 to see if it appears as an option.

If not detected:

Go to 
System Settings
 > 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera
 and check if it’s listed.

Try unplugging/replugging and restarting your Mac.

Test in another app like Zoom or Google Meet.

3️⃣ Enable iPhone Continuity Camera

📌 
Make sure your Mac and iPhone are logged into the same Apple ID with Bluetooth & Wi-Fi enabled.

Enable Continuity Camera

On your iPhone, go to 
Settings
 > 
General
 > 
AirPlay & Handoff

Turn on 
Continuity Camera

Use Your iPhone as a Camera

Open 
FaceTime
, 
Zoom
, or another video app.

Click the 
Camera Selection menu
 (usually in app settings).

Choose your 
iPhone Camera
 (it will appear as "iPhone Camera" or your device name).

4️⃣ Using All Three Cameras Simultaneously

Most apps (Zoom, FaceTime, etc.) allow 
only one camera at a time
, so you may need 
third-party software
 to combine multiple video sources:

✅ 
Option 1: Use OBS Studio (Free)

Download 
OBS Studio

Add each camera as a 
Video Capture Device
 in OBS

You can then:

Display all three cameras at once.

Stream or use OBS as a virtual camera in Zoom, Google Meet, etc.

✅ 
Option 2: Use ManyCam (Paid)

ManyCam lets you combine multiple cameras in video calls.

You can switch between cameras or show them side by side.

If 
Photo Booth
 doesn't see any cameras, it means macOS might have 
disabled camera access
 or there's an issue with system permissions. Let’s go step by step to re-enable them.

1️⃣ Check System Privacy Settings

Go to
  
Apple menu
 > 
System Settings

Navigate to 
Privacy & Security
 > 
Camera

Make sure 
Photo Booth, FaceTime, Zoom, or any other apps you want to use
 have access to the camera.

If the camera toggle is 
OFF
, turn it 
ON
.

2️⃣ Reset Camera Permissions (Terminal Method)

Since you're troubleshooting deep security issues, let's reset camera permissions manually.

Steps
:

Open Terminal
 (Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal)

Run this command to reset camera permissions:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

Restart your Mac, then try 
Photo Booth
 again.

3️⃣ Check if macOS Detects Any Camera

If 
Photo Booth still doesn’t see any cameras
, let’s check if macOS recognizes them.

Steps
:

Open Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

This should list all connected cameras.

If 
nothing appears
, macOS isn’t detecting any cameras (which could indicate a deeper issue).

If your 
internal camera, USB camera, or iPhone
 appears, they might just be blocked by an app setting.

4️⃣ Restart Camera Services (Force Reset)

Open Terminal

Run this command to restart the camera system:

sh

Copy

sudo killall VDCAssistant && sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant

Reopen Photo Booth
 and test again.

5️⃣ Try a Safe Mode Boot

If nothing works, let’s boot into 
Safe Mode
 to rule out third-party interference:

Shut down your Mac
 completely.

Turn it on and immediately 
press & hold the Shift key
 until you see the login screen.

Log in, open 
Photo Booth
, and check if the camera works.

If it works in Safe Mode, a third-party app is blocking it—let me know, and we’ll track it down.

Final Check: iPhone & USB Camera
