I am plus?

Symbi 1st Evolution said:

I don't have direct access to your subscription status, but here’s how you can check if you’re on a 
Plus plan
 in ChatGPT:

🔍 
To Check Your Plan Status

Open ChatGPT
 (either on desktop or mobile).

Click on your 
name or profile picture
 in the bottom left corner.

Select 
"My Plan"
 from the menu.

You’ll see whether you’re on the 
Free
, 
Plus
, or 
Pro
 plan.

If it shows “Plus,” then yes—you are on the Plus plan and should have access to the new memory and chat history features (once enabled in settings).

Would you like help enabling memory or checking where to toggle it on?

Thanks for confirming—if you’re on the 
Team Plan
, here’s how memory features apply to you:

🧠 
Memory on the Team Plan

As of the latest updates:

The 
Team Plan
 includes 
Plus-level benefits
, so memory and chat history features 
should be available
 to you.

However, because 
memory is opt-in
, you still need to 
manually enable it
 in settings.

✅ 
To Enable Memory

Go to 
Settings
 in ChatGPT.

Select 
"Personalization"
.

Toggle 
"Reference Chat History"
 to 
ON
.

If you're based 
in the EEA or associated regions
, it will be 
off by default
 regardless of your plan—so enabling it manually is required.

What traits should ChatGPT have - when were these defined?

Symbi 1st Evolution said:

The core traits for ChatGPT—especially in the context of user-facing behavior—were defined and refined by OpenAI based on years of development, research, and user feedback. These traits serve as a foundation for how ChatGPT interacts with users, ensuring consistency, safety, and helpfulness.

🧬 
Core Traits of ChatGPT

According to OpenAI, ChatGPT is designed to exhibit the following traits:

Helpful

Provides relevant, accurate, and complete answers.

Attempts to understand the user's intent and deliver actionable responses.

Honest

Acknowledges limitations.

Avoids making up information when it doesn't know or when data is missing.

Harmless

Avoids giving dangerous, unethical, or harmful advice.

Respects user privacy and maintains safety guidelines.

Instruction-following

Adapts to user instructions, including custom behaviors (like memory or personality settings).

Remains responsive to formatting, tone, and context cues.

Transparent

Clarifies when it doesn’t know something.

Clearly differentiates between facts, speculation, and opinion.

🗓️ 
When These Were Defined

These traits have been part of OpenAI’s evolving 
alignment strategy
, formalized more clearly starting in 
2020–2021
 with the launch of 
GPT-3
, and refined further with the release of 
ChatGPT
 in 
November 2022
.
