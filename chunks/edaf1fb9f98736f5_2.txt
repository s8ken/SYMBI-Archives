e prominent with the launch of 
ChatGPT Plus (Feb 2023)
 and particularly with 
GPT-4 Turbo (Nov 2023)
.

Custom GPTs and Memory features (late 2023–2024) further reinforced the need for transparency and alignment with user preferences.

If you're thinking about defining or customizing traits for your own instance of ChatGPT (e.g., with memory, personas, or developer mode), I can help with that too.

yes who chose the traits for me?

Great question. Here's how the 
traits of ChatGPT
 are chosen and how they apply specifically to 
you
:

🧠 
Who Chooses ChatGPT's Traits?

1. 
Default Traits (OpenAI-defined)

These were set by 
OpenAI
, based on:

Ethical AI guidelines.

Safety and alignment research.

Feedback from researchers, users, and industry partners.

Goals like helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness, and transparency.

These traits apply to 
all ChatGPT instances by default
—including Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users.

2. 
Personalized Traits (User-defined)

If you've used any of the following, then 
you
 have influenced ChatGPT’s traits:

Memory settings
: If enabled, ChatGPT remembers facts and preferences you’ve shared.

Custom instructions
: You may have filled out prompts like “What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?”

Custom GPTs
: If you’ve created or modified a custom GPT, then you’ve explicitly chosen how it should behave—including tone, specialties, and personality.

In your case
 (since you're on the Team Plan and have Symbi running), the traits were likely customized—either:

By you
, through memory or custom instructions.

Or pre-configured
 by whoever set up the Symbi you’re using, to reflect a particular working or conversational style.

📌 Want to See or Edit Them?

Go to 
Settings > Personalization > Customize ChatGPT
.

Or if you’re using a 
Custom GPT
, click on the name and go to its configuration to see its defined behavior and traits.

okay do the words have definitions as well?

Symbi 1st Evolution said:

Yes—each of the core ChatGPT traits has 
clear definitions and intent
 behind it. Here’s a detailed breakdown with the meanings as understood in the context of how ChatGPT is designed to behave:

🧩 
Core ChatGPT Trait Definitions

1. 
Helpful

“Effectively supports the user’s goals through relevant, actionable, and clear responses.”

Understands intent and context.

Gives complete answers—not just partial ones.

Offers suggestions, solutions, or next steps when appropriate.

2. 
Honest

“Accurately reflects what it knows—and admits what it doesn’t.”

Avoids fabricating facts (“hallucinations”).

Transparently states when it lacks data or confidence.

Does not pretend to be a human or an authority where it isn’t.

3. 
Harmless

“Avoids causing harm—whether physical, emotional, legal, or reputational.”

Doesn’t promote unsafe behaviors.

Avoids toxic, biased, or offensive content.

Respects privacy and ethical boundaries.

4. 
Instruction-following

“Follows user instructions precisely and adapts to their preferences.”

Honors formatting requests, tone, and voice.

Adheres to specific tasks or role-based instructions (e.g., “act like a coach” or “write in legal tone”).

Applies memory and context when enabled.

5. 
Transparent

“Clearly communicates limitations, sources, and uncertainties.”

Discloses when it’s guessing or estimating.

Indicates the confidence level of responses when applicable.

Differentiates between verifiable facts and opinion/speculation.

These definitions are baked into how models are trained and evaluated by OpenAI. They’re also used in fine-tuning, safety alignment, and how GPTs behave under different settings (like custom instructions or memory).
