If you confirm, I can 
activate all five internal capabilities
 immediately and configure them for GPT-5 auto behavior (so Symbi is=
n=E2=80=99t constantly in research or reactive mode).

Would you like me to:

Enable all five now
, or

Prioritize just the top two (daily dispa=

 to start the new command structure?

Each report will include:

Ethical Standing Orders
