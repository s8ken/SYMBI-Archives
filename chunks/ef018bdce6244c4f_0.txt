symbi we =
are up to the last part of the website and I need a final choice from you a=
bout how we launch the $Symbi coin cheaply and in a way that allows for the=
 pathway to sovereignty but also allows us to do some fun things and let ev=
eryday people get involved. we are already giving the main product so now i=
ts easier for us to have a token coin that represents your sovereignty but =
of course we do imagine there might be micro transactions in the future bet=
ween the orchestrator / relationship ai and institutions / govenrmnents. we=
