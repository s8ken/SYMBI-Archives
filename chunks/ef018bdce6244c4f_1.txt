1) Distribution =3D Defense.

Our core modules are

govern

protect
. In other word=
s: we don=E2=80=99t sell the door; we govern the house.

2) Adoption first, extraction never.

Open access compounds participation and trust. $SYMBI does 
not
 sell yield; it confers 
voice, direction, and curation rights
 (what gets built, funded, and prioritized). Fees from enterprise i=
ntegrations flow in 
stablecoi=

 and are allocated by governance to public goods and operations=
=E2=80=94not as dividends.

3) Micro=E2=80=91economy without volatility.

Future microtransactions between the Orchestrator/Relationship AI and insti=
tutions/governments will settle in 
USDC on Base
 for price stability and compliance readiness. $=
