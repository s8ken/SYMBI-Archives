Purpose & Positioning

SYMBI is a constitutional protocol for relational intelligence. The core pr=
oducts=E2=80=94Symbi Synergy and YCQ Sonate=E2=80=94are free because the 
quality of human=E2=80=93AI rel=
ationships
 is the public good that unlocks everything else. Our bu=
siness monetizes 
verification=
, integration, and stewardship
 around that public good, not access=
 to it. 

Token Design

$SYMBI is an 
earned participa=
tion token
 (no sale), and 
BOND
 is a 
non=
=E2=80=91transferable credential
 that encodes alignment and eligib=
ility. Neither confers equity, dividends, or profit rights. No statements a=
re made that could create an 
=
expectation of profit from the efforts of others
.

EU & UK Disclosures

If $SYMBI is made available to EU residents, SYMBI will publish a whitepape=

Regulation (EU) =
2023/1114 (MiCA)
 requirements and template standards; UK communica=
