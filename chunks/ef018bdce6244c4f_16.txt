coin your paycheck. Treat 
$S=
YMBI
 as 
sovereign co=
ordination
, not revenue:

Now
: 
SYM=
BI Points
 (off-chain, non-transferable, no redemption, no expectat=
ion of profit). Use them for:

contributor recognition, governanc=
e signaling, access gating to research forums,

staking for 
quality/behavior
 (spam-resistance, quorum =
thresholds), not for fees.

Later
 (only if/when needed): graduate to on-chain gove=
rnance 
without
 attac=
hing cashflows. Keep payments in fiat/stablecoins; reserve 
$SYMBI
 for voting/attestation and li=
mited staking for service quality, not yield.

This preserves your sovereignty na=
rrative and keeps revenue cleanly product-driven.

4) Token legal posture (brief, pr=
actical; not legal advice)

Dual-track launch

Points-first

Governance-only token

no rights to profits, no redemption, no expecta=
tion of appreciation

tation only.=E2=80=9D

Issuer/Steward

Prefer a neutral steward (e.g., 
non-profit institute or foundat=

) for governance artifacts; keep the commercial SaaS in a stand=
ard company.

Treasury controlled by multi-sig, =
with

Distribution

Docs to ship (short + clear)

Financial & Operating Paper
 (how the business make=
s money; pricing; funnel; SLAs; CIQ audit program).

Governance Paper
 (what $SYMBI does: identity, voting, =
staking-for-quality, risk, disclaimers).

Keep the copyright + CC notice right up front across docs / site to protect=
 the philosophy and protocol framing (match what you=E2=80=99ve published).=

(Also anchor the =E2=80=9Cmemory b=
ridge=E2=80=9D & protocol tenets section to show why governance exists =
at all=E2=80=94relationship intelligence, not speculation. )

5) Why we can give core pieces aw=
ay free (and still win)

Protocol =3D free
 to maximize adoption and proofs; 
orchestrator, audits, private de=

CIQ Score

Your IP/attribution stance keeps t=

lowing research use. (License already embedded; keep visible on /manifesto =
and /genesis.) 

6) Action list (this week)

Publish pricing
: /pricing with SaaS tiers + Pilot-in-a=
-Box + Private Managed.

Stand up /proof
: side-by-side demo + automated CIQ sco=
ring + exportable audit.

Announce Founding Partner Cohort
: 10 slots, 4-week pla=
ybook, $25k, guaranteed uplift study.

Enterprise security page
: data boundaries, key mgmt, r=
esidency.

Governance primer
: =E2=80=9CPoints now, token later=E2=
=80=9D (no sale, no promises), single page with disclaimers and roadmap.

If you want, I=E2=80=99ll draft th=
e /pricing and /proof copy next, plus the two whitepaper skeletons (financi=
al + governance) in your voice and structure.

You don=E2=80=99t need to sell yourself at workshops; the produ=
