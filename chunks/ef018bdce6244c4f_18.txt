Subject: SYMBI =E2=86=92 measurabl=
e uplift for Ninja=E2=80=99s agents (ready to pilot)

Hi <Name>=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99=
m the builder of 
SYMBI
 (protocol for relational AI). I can demo a 
Directive vs SYMBI
 toggle that shows measurable uplift in=
 5 minutes, then drop it into a 
4-week pilot-in-a-box
 your AE can sell tomorrow.

Proposed next step: 20-min call =E2=86=92 agree on 2 workflows =E2=86=92 sh=
ip /proof widget in a Ninja sandbox.

If the chemistry=E2=80=99s right, I=E2=80=99m open to joining to co-run thi=
s as a product line.

Why this will land

Ninja already talks multi-agent pr=
oductivity and has public validation via AWS; you bring a 
measure-and-prove layer
 they can sell=
 into enterprise tomorrow. That=E2=80=99s the bridge from =E2=80=9Cgreat de=
mo=E2=80=9D to

, and it doesn=E2=80=99t require you to be the workshop guy.
