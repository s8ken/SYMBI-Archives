or pilot

Hi 

,

I=E2=80=99m the builder of 

SYMBI

, a relationship=E2=80=91int=
elligence layer for agents. I can drop a 

Directive =E2=
=86=94 SYMBI

 toggle into a Ninja sandbox that shows m=
easurable uplift (clarity, safety, task success) in minutes.

Proposal:

 Run a 4=E2=80=91week 

Pilot=E2=80=91in=E2=80=91a=E2=80=91Box

: b=
aseline logs =E2=86=92 SYMBI toggle =E2=86=92 CIQ Audit =E2=86=92 exec read=
out. We co=E2=80=91sell this as a SKU and roll wins into Enterprise.
=

If it=E2=80=99s valuable, I=E2=80=99m open to joining to co=E2=
=80=91run this line. I attached a 5=E2=80=91slide deck and a pilot SOW we c=
an start from.

1) Problem =E2=86=92 Promise

Agent demos wow; 

renewals

 require measured uplift + safety.

SYMB=
I =3D relationship intelligence layer (context bridge, trust receipts, gove=
rnance).

Promise: 

proof in=
 minutes

, not months.

Speaker:

 We=E2=80=99re not replacing Nin=
ja. We=E2=80=99re the layer that makes =E2=80=9Cshow me the value=E2=80=9D =
trivial to prove.

2) How it works (Directive =
vs SYMBI)

In=E2=80=91app =
toggle: 

Directive

 (baseline) =E2=
=86=94 

SYMBI

 (relational protoco=
l on).

Measures: CIQ deltas (clarity, breadth, =
safety, completion), time=E2=80=91to=E2=80=91task, user retention.

Outputs: Cryptographic 

Trust Recei=
pts

 + 

audit trail

.

Speaker:

 One click to prove uplift. We a=
ttach a receipt to every interaction for governance/compliance.

3) What ships in 2 weeks

/proof widget

 + CIQ metric=
s UI.

Context Bridge

 adapter for Ninja agents.

Trust Fra=

: receipts + attestation schema.

Speaker:

 Minimal code, maximu=
