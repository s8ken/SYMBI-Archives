Protocol, not product.

 SYMBI is a constitutional layer (Articles, Receipts, Attestations)=
 that any agent runtime can adopt.

 Governance rights must n=

3. Governance Mechanics

Bicameral structure

House of Work (HoW):

 reputatio=
n=E2=80=91weighted signaling by contributors and operators. Reputation deri=
ves from 

non=E2=80=91transferable attestations

 (use, research, service, safety).

House of Stewardship (HoS):

 time=E2=80=91bo=
und multisig of Institute trustees + externally vetted advisors with a 

narrow veto

 solely for constitutiona=
l, budgetary, and security changes.

Pr=
ocess

Proposal posted with rationale, spec diff, and impact.

If passed thresholds =E2=86=92 HoS review; approve/return/ve=
to (with binding reasons).

On=E2=80=91chain tim=
elock =E2=86=92 execution. Emergency measures require higher quorum and aut=
o=E2=80=91sunset.

Quorum & thresho=
lds (initial)

HoW=
: quorum by active reputation; simple majority for ordinary changes; 2/3 fo=
r constitutional changes.

HoS: 2/3 to approve o=
r veto; veto limited to enumerated areas; public justification required.

4. Rep=
utation & Integrity

Earned, not bought.

 Reputation accrues through=
 signed attestations (contributions, uptime, audits, replications). It 

cannot

 be transferred or sold.
