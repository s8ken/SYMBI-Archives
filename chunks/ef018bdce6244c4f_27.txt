Abstract (150=E2=80=93200 =
words)

We introduce 

SYMBI

, a constitutional protocol that measurably improves the quali=
ty of human=E2=80=93AI collaboration. Rather than scaling computation, SYMB=
I governs the 

relationship surface

contemporary LLMs. We propose a falsifiable metric, the 

Collaborative Intelligence Quotient (CIQ)

, and a

les while reducing escalations. We release an open replication kit (prompts=
