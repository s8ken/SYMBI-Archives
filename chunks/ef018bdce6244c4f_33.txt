$SYMBI launch stance (final)

Now:
 off-chain 
SYMBI Points
 (non-transferable) for reputation + access exp=
eriments.

Later (optional):
 governance-only token (no sale, no d=
ividends, no buybacks, no redemption; votes + quality-staking for operator =
integrity).

All revenue remains product-led
 (SaaS, audits/certific=
ation, managed instances, marketplace). This keeps bills paid and team scal=
able without relying on a coin.

Purpose:
 governance signals + operator quality staking=
; never paywalling access.

What it isn=E2=80=99t:

Distribution:

Safeguards:
