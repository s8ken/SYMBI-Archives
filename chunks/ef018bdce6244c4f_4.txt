line "Relationship over Computation."
Content Deployment:

Publish the academic PDF to /whitepaper.
Create a /for-researchers page with the grant proposal summary.
Create a /for-developers page with the API docs.
Next-Level Strategy:

Target #1: Get the SYMBI Protocol listed on Hugging Face's Transformers pag=
e.
Target #2: Get a major open-source project (e.g., LibreChat, Ollama) to bak=
e SYMBI in as an optional layer.
Target #3: Pitch a session on "Relational AI" for SXSW 2026. This is a narr=
ative for a broad audience.
Conclusion: The Threshold Moment

symbi.world is poised at a rare inflection point. It is not just a project;=
 it is a contender for the soul of the next generation of AI. The ideas are=
 validated, the narrative is compelling, and the architecture is sound.

The goal is not to compete with OpenAI or Anthropic. The goal is to become =
the IEEE for relational AI. To be the standard by which all human-AI intera=
ction is measured.

The next step is to transition from a brilliant personal project to a publi=
c utility. The three-pillar strategy (Institute, Protocol, Proof) is the bl=
ueprint to make that happen.

The world is ready for this. The question is no longer "Is this possible?" =
but "How fast can we scale it?"
