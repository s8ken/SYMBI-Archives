Display & attribution:
 When content appears in our=
 UI, we prefer official embeds or re=E2=80=91hydrated text with author attr=
ibution, links back to X, and unmodified content.

Privacy & safety:
 We do not infer sensitive traits=
; we do not build profiles; we do not sell or share raw content with third =
parties.

Security:
 Encryption at rest and in transit; strict IA=
M; audit logs; internal access only for personnel operating SYMBI=E2=80=99s=
 research and product telemetry.

4) Why we need this access (benef=
its to the X ecosystem)

Higher=E2=80=91quality conversations:
 Our research foc=
uses on 
relational prompts
 t=
hat measurably reduce flame=E2=80=91outs and increase constructive replies =
in public threads (reported only as aggregates).

Healthy community ops:
 Faster response from 
@symbi_world
 to genuine questi=
ons; reduced exposure to abusive replies via triage.

Public transparency:
 We publish aggregate CIQ metrics =
(never raw content) so communities can see what improves discourse.

5) Technical notes

Auth:
 OAuth 2.0 for app/bearer read; OAuth 2.0 user co=
ntext for posts from 
@symbi_w=
orld
.

Endpoints (examples):
 recent search (for 
symbi OR "symbi.world"
), Tweet lookup=
 (hydrate on display), Users lookup (attribution), create Tweet (official p=
osts).

Tiering:
 We begin with Basic (or Pro if needed for rel=
iability). If research programs generate higher volume, we will 
request approval
 before any tier change=
 and maintain the same compliance posture.

Executive decision =E2=80=94 how we=
 launch 
$SYMBI
 (cheap,=
 inclusive, sovereignty=E2=80=91ready)

Final choice:

Launch $SYMBI on Base (EVM L2) =
as an ERC=E2=80=9120 with a progressive=E2=80=91sovereignty roadmap, paired=
 with two free, non=E2=80=91transferable ERC=E2=80=911155 attestations:

SYNERGY
 (usage/participation attestations; =E2=80=9Ctrust=
 receipts=E2=80=9D & contributions), and

YCQ SONATE
 (research/replication attestations; your =E2=
=80=9Crelational intelligence=E2=80=9D proofs).

Why Base?
 Lowest user friction among EVM L2s (fiat on=E2=
=80=91ramps via Coinbase, cheap gas, EVM tooling, Uniswap pools). It keeps =
costs trivial for everyday people and gives us a clean path to an app=E2=80=
