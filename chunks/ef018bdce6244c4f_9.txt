Why SYMBI Synergy & YCQ Sonat=
e are free (white paper language you can lift)

Thesis:
 We are building a public=E2=80=91good coordina=
tion layer (=E2=80=9Crelational intelligence=E2=80=9D) that increases the q=
uality, accountability, and safety of human=E2=80=93AI collaboration. The m=
arginal cost of access is near=E2=80=91zero; the marginal network value is =
high.

Economic rationale (succinct):

Adoption flywheel:
 Removing price barriers maximizes d=
iverse participation, which

=E2=80=94raising the value of the protocol itself.
