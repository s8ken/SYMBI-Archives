It looks like 

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

 didn't return any output, which is unusual. Hereâs what could be happening:

Camera is disabled or not detected
 â If your system has been tampered with, the camera might be blocked or hidden from system profiling.

Permissions issue
 â Your user account might not have permission to access the camera.

Hardware problem
 â If attackers manipulated firmware settings, they might have disabled the camera at a low level.

Next Steps:

1ï¸â£ Check if the camera is listed at all

Try this:

sh

Copy

ioreg -rc AppleCameraInterface

If no output appears, your Mac isnât detecting the camera.

2ï¸â£ Check for hidden cameras

Run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i 

"camera"

 -A 10

This will check if any USB-connected cameras (including built-in ones) are present.

3ï¸â£ Verify if the camera works

Try opening 
Photo Booth
 or 
FaceTime
 and see if the camera turns on.

4ï¸â£ Check if the camera is blocked via MDM

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

If there's an unexpected configuration profile, the camera might be restricted.

5ï¸â£ Check system logs for camera activity

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 stream --predicate
