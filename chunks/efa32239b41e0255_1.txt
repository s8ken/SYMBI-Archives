If attackers are controlling the camera, logs may show unexpected activity.

Let me know what you find!

it not because you and I disabled all cameras in terminal 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Since we manually disabled all cameras earlier, the missing output from 
system_profiler SPCameraDataType
 makes sense.

If you want to 
re-enable the camera
, try:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

Then restart your Mac and check if it shows up again using:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

If you prefer to 
keep it disabled
, then no further action is neededâthis confirms that the camera is completely blocked.

Since resetting 
TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions
 for the camera didn't bring it back, the camera is either:

Disabled at a deeper system level (e.g., firmware or kernel settings)

Blocked by an MDM (Mobile Device Management) profile

Not detected by macOS, possibly due to security measures or tampering

Next Steps:

â 
Check if macOS recognizes the camera at all

Run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -rc AppleCameraInterface

If thereâs no output, macOS isn't seeing the camera at the hardware level.

â 
Look for USB or internal camera devices

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i 

"camera"

 -A 10

If your camera is listed here, it's physically present but may be software-disabled.

â 
Check for MDM restrictions

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

Look for any suspicious profiles that might be blocking camera access.

â 
Check if the camera is blocked via NVRAM settings

Run:

sh

Copy

nvram -p | grep -i camera

If anything related to the camera appears, it might be disabled at the firmware level.

Let me know what you find, and weâll take it from there!

ChatGPT said:

Since 
ioreg -rc AppleCameraInterface
 returned nothing, macOS isnât detecting the camera at all.

This means one of the following:

The camera is physically disconnected or disabled at the hardware level
 (via firmware or EFI settings).

A security setting or MDM profile is blocking it.

The system has been tampered with to hide or remove camera functionality.

Next Steps:

â 
Check if any USB devices are detected (including the camera)

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

Look for anything related to a camera. If it's missing, the system doesnât see it as a connected device.

â 
Check for hidden system restrictions

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

If any unexpected profiles are installed, they might be enforcing camera restrictions.

â 
Check if the camera is disabled via NVRAM

sh

Copy

nvram -p | grep -i camera

If any entries show up, your firmware settings may be blocking the camera.

â 
Try resetting SMC (System Management Controller)

Since the camera is hardware-integrated, resetting the SMC might bring it back:

Shut down
 your Mac.

Hold Shift + Control + Option + Power
 for 
10 seconds
 (M1 Macs will reset SMC on restart).

Turn the Mac back on
 and re-run the commands.

ChatGPT said:

Since 
nvram -p | grep -i camera
 returned nothing, your camera is 
not explicitly disabled via NVRAM settings
.

At this point, the camera is either:

Disabled at the firmware level (EFI or hardware block)

Completely removed (physically or virtually, via tampering)

Blocked by system security settings (MDM, kernel extensions, etc.)

Next Steps:

â 
Check if any USB devices (including the camera) are detected

Run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

This will list all USB-connected devices. If your camera is missing, the system does not recognize it at all
