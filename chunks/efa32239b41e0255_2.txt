â 
Check for hidden system restrictions (MDM profiles, security policies)

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

If a profile is installed, it might be enforcing a security policy that blocks the camera.

â 
Check for restricted kernel extensions

Run:

sh

Copy

kmutil inspect --list-loaded | grep -i camera

If anything related to the camera appears, it means a kernel extension (kext) is handling it.

â 
Try an SMC reset (for hardware-related issues)

If the camera still doesn't show up, resetting the 
System Management Controller (SMC)
 could help:

Shut down
 your Mac.

Press and hold Shift + Control + Option + Power for 10 seconds.

Release the keys, then turn your Mac back on.

Run 
system_profiler SPCameraDataType
 again to check.

â 
Do you want to keep the camera disabled or restore it?

If you want it permanently disabled for security, this means 
it's completely blocked and no further action is needed
. But if you want it back, we can try more advanced recovery steps.

Normally, a MacBook's internal camera would show up as something like 
"FaceTime HD Camera"
 under USB.

It is 
not detected at all
, meaning macOS doesnât see it at the hardware level.

An external camera is detected:
