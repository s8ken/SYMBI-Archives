ted camera, meaning it's either:

One you plugged in.

A disguised or unauthorized device impersonating a webcam.

ð 
Possible Explanations for the Missing Built-in Camera

1ï¸â£ Firmware or EFI tampering (most likely)

If an attacker modified your 
EFI firmware
, they could have disabled the internal camera at a low level.

This would prevent macOS from detecting it, even in 
Terminal
 or 
system logs
.

2ï¸â£ The camera was disabled via hardware

Some Mac models allow hardware-based camera disabling.

If the system was remotely compromised, the attacker may have used a command or low-level tool to disable it.

3ï¸â£ A rogue external device is masquerading as a webcam

The 
EMEET SmartCam S600
 may be a real webcam 
or
 a rogue device.

If you donât recognize it, we should investigate further.

ð  
Next Steps to Investigate & Fix

â 
1. Confirm whether the EMEET camera is real or suspicious

Run this command:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 | grep -A20 -i 

"EMEET"

This will show 
extra details
 about the detected webcam.

â 
2. Check if the Macâs internal camera is hidden via firmware

Run:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

If 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is disabled
, attackers may have used low-level system modifications.

â 
3. Check for any hidden system services related to cameras

Run:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i camera

This will list background services that may be controlling camera access.

â 
4. Check for unauthorized kernel extensions

Run:

sh

Copy

kmutil inspect --list-loaded | grep -i camera

If any camera-related extensions appear, it may indicate tampering.

ð¥ 
Do You Want to Restore the Internal Camera or Keep It Disabled?

If you want to 
permanently disable all cameras
, youâre already in a good state.

If you want to 
restore the built-in MacBook camera
, we will need 
firmware troubleshooting
.

its one I plugged in but I can't even see that

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Since you plugged in the 
EMEET SmartCam S600
 but canât see it in apps, itâs possible that 
macOS permissions, security settings, or hidden system modifications
 are blocking it.

ð 
Troubleshooting Steps for External Camera Not Showing Up in Apps

â 
1. Check if macOS Recognizes the Camera in System Profiler

Since 
system_profiler SPUSBDataType
 already detected it, letâs check if macOS 
sees it as a camera
:

Run:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPCameraDataType

If the 
EMEET camera appears
, it means macOS recognizes it but an app permission issue might be blocking it.

If 
nothing appears
, macOS may not be registering it as a usable camera.

â 
2. Check if macOS Blocks It for Privacy Reasons

Run:

sh

Copy

tccutil reset Camera

This resets all app permissions for the camera.

Then, try opening an app like 
FaceTime, Zoom, or QuickTime Player
 to see if it asks for access again.

â 
3. Check Camera Permissions in System Settings

Go to 
System Settings â Privacy & Security â Camera

Ensure apps like 
FaceTime, Zoom, QuickTime, etc.
 have access.

If the camera isnât listed at all, macOS doesnât see it as a valid camera.

â 
4. Check If Another Process Is Blocking It

Run:

sh

Copy

lsof | grep -i 

"camera"

This shows if another process is locking camera access.

If you see anything suspicious or unknown, we can investigate further.

â 
5. Force macOS to Recognize the Camera

Unplug the camera

Run this command to restart the USB system

sh

Copy

sudo killall VDCAssistant && sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant

Plug the camera back in

Test in FaceTime or QuickTime

ð 
Let me know what happens after these steps!

If 
SPCameraDataType shows nothing
, macOS isnât registering the camera at all.

If 
it shows up but doesnât work
, itâs likely a software block.

If 
lsof shows an unknown process
, we may have a security issue.
