ð¨ Deployment Still Failing Due to 
app/api/replicate/route.ts

The error 
"File '/vercel/path0/app/api/replicate/route.ts' is not a module"
 means 
Next.js doesn't recognize this file correctly
. Let's 
fix it step by step
. ð

ð Step 1: Find and Open 
route.ts

Since you're having trouble opening the file, let's 
ensure it exists
 and 
open it correctly
.

Method 1: Using Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows)

Go to your project folder
:

bash

Copy

Edit

~/Documents/symbi/

Navigate through the subfolders
:

nginx

Copy

Edit

app

 â api â replicate

Look for 
route.ts
 inside the 
replicate
 folder.

Method 2: Open 
route.ts
 in VS Code (Recommended)

If you have 
VS Code installed
, use this command:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi
code app/api/replicate/route.ts

This will open the file 
directly in VS Code
.

Method 3: Open 
route.ts
 in Nano (Terminal-Based Editor)

If you 
donât have VS Code
, use this:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi
nano app/api/replicate/route.ts

This opens the file in 
Nano Editor
.

Make changes
.

Press 
Ctrl + X
 to exit
.

Press 
Y
 to save
.

Press 
Enter
 to confirm
.

ð ï¸ Step 2: Fix the File

Once the file is open, 
replace its contents
 with the correct format:

â 
Correct 
route.ts
 Code

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { 

NextResponse

 } 

from

"next/server"
