r additional CMS sections!

You said:

okay and that had the page names like what why and who?

ChatGPT said:

Great question â yes, the updated version still includes the 
"What"
, 
"Why"
, and 
"Who"
 sections 
visually and structurally
, 
but
 the content inside each section can now be dynamically managed through Sanity CMS.

To clarify:

â What's Included:

Headings like 
"What We Offer"
, 
"Why Symbi"
, and 
"Who We Are"
 are 
still present
.

These can now be controlled via Sanity, depending on how you've structured your schema (like in 
page.ts
 or 
siteSettings.ts
).

The rest of the content can be rendered via 
PortableText
 or custom serializers for rich editing.

ð ï¸ What's Next?

To make sure each section ("what", "why", "who") pulls 
specific content
 from Sanity, we can:

Add fields for each in the schema (e.g., 
sectionWhat
, 
sectionWhy
, 
sectionWho
).

Fetch them individually in 
getPage()
 or restructure your query.

Render them where appropriate in your layout with conditionals or portable text blocks.

Would you like me to help:

â Add these fields to your Sanity schema?

â Update the frontend to read each one specifically?

â Show you how to edit them inside the Studio?

Let me know which step you'd like next â or all three!

You said:

well lets save it first and see the integration works

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â great move. Letâs confirm everything is 
saved and integrated properly
 before diving into schema refinement. Hereâs how to verify the full loop is working:

â Sanity + Next.js Integration Checklist:

1. 
Sanity Studio
:

Go to 

http://localhost:3001/studio

.

In the sidebar, you should see document types like 
Page
 or 
Site Settings
.

Open a page (like your test one) and confirm you can edit 
title
 and 
content
.

2. 
Next.js Frontend
:

Visit 

http://localhost:3001

.

Confirm the frontend is rendering the title/content from Sanity (e.g. âtest page titleâ).

Any changes you make in the Studio should reflect after a refresh (or with hot reload).

3. 
Code Structure
 (confirm the important files are in place):

â 
lib/sanity.ts
 (client setup)

â 
app/page.tsx
 (data fetching + rendering logic)

â 
schemas/page.ts
 (document schema)

â 
sanity.config.ts
 (Sanity config file)

ð Not Seeing Content Updates?

If itâs not rendering the content yet:

Double-check the page ID or query (e.g., 
*[_type == "page"][0]
).

Ensure you're using 
PortableText
 correctly to render 
content
.

Let me know if you'd like to connect specific fields to sections like "What", "Why", "Who".

When youâre ready, I can help:

Add custom sections to your schema.

Map content from Sanity to specific areas in the homepage.

Deploy the updated site to Vercel when it's all working.

Let me know when you're ready to test with live content or build more!

You said:

npm run dev

ChatGPT said:

Great! Just make sure youâre in the correct project folder (looks like 
symbi-main-site
), then run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

If everything is wired correctly, you should see something like:

arduino

Copy

Edit

â¡  Local: http:

//localhost:3000

If it switches to port 
3001
, no problem â still works the same.

â After it's running:

Visit 

http://localhost:3001

 to view your main site.

Visit 

http://localhost:3001/studio

 to access Sanity Studio.

Let me know:

If you get any errors during startup

Or if you want to validate the CMS-driven content rendering after it loads

I'll stay on standby to help you verify and improve it from there!
