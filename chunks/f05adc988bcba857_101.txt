Perfect catch â the issue is just a missing export in your 
lib/sanity.ts
 file. Letâs fix it now.

â Step 1: Open 
lib/sanity.ts

In this file, make sure you add the 
getPage
 function and export it properly. Here's what your complete 
lib/sanity.ts
 should look like:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient, groq } 

from

"next-sanity"

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

, 

// replace if needed

dataset

: 

"production"

,

apiVersion

: 

"2023-01-01"

,

useCdn

: 

true

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

 client.

fetch

(
    groq
`*[_type == "page"][0]{
      title,
      content
    }`

  )
}

â Step 2: Save the file and re-run your dev server

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Once that's done, the 
getPage()
 import in 
app/page.tsx
 will resolve correctly, and your CMS data should start flowing into your frontend.

Let me know once itâs reloaded or if you want help rendering that 
title
 or 
content
 from Sanity in the layout!

Thanks for confirming â this tells us that either:

The 
getPage
 function is 
missing
 from your 
lib/sanity.ts
 file, or

It exists but is 
not being exported properly
, or

There's a 
path resolution issue
 with the alias 
@/lib/sanity
.

Let's go through each possible fix:

â Fix 1: Ensure 
getPage
 is defined and exported

Open 
lib/sanity.ts
 and 
ensure the file looks like this
:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient, groq } 

from

"next-sanity"

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

, 

// â your real project ID

dataset

: 

"production"

,

apiVersion

: 

"2023-01-01"

,

useCdn

: 

true

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

 client.

fetch

(
    groq
`*[_type == "page"][0]{
      title,
      content
    }`

  )
}

â Fix 2: Restart the dev server

If you just added or edited that export, make sure to restart your dev server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

â Fix 3: Confirm path alias resolution (
@/lib/sanity
)

Make sure that the 
tsconfig.json
 (or 
jsconfig.json
) in your project root includes the 
@
 alias like this:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"compilerOptions"

:

{

"baseUrl"

:

"."

,

"paths"

:

{

"@/*"

:

[

"./*"

]

}

}

}

Then 
restart the TypeScript server
 (or VS Code), and restart your dev server again.

Let me know if youâd like me to help check the contents of 
lib/sanity.ts
 again â just paste it in here and Iâll verify itâs all good.
