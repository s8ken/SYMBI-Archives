Let me know once itâs in â or if you hit any snags.

You said:

ok so looks like its working

ChatGPT said:

Beautiful! ð That means your 
Sanity
 backend is now 
successfully integrated
 with your Next.js frontend â and you're able to 
query live CMS content
 from your Sanity Studio and render it on your site. Big win! ð

â Whatâs Working Now:

lib/sanity.ts
 is set up with the right project credentials.

Your 
getPage()
 function is fetching the correct data (like 
title
, 
content
) from the Sanity 
page
 schema.

The homepage (
app/page.tsx
) is now connected and hydrated with CMS data.

Dev server is running with no errors.

ð Next Steps You Might Consider:

Render the actual CMS content
 in the UI.

If you haven't yet, loop through the 
content
 blocks and render them dynamically with something like 

@portabletext/react

.

Make multiple sections CMS-editable

You can build out additional Sanity schemas like:

team.ts

hero.ts

cta.ts

Deploy this new version to Vercel

Since you're working off a 
main-site
 branch, you can set up a 
Preview Deployment
 in Vercel for testing and collaboration.

Enable live preview mode (optional)

If you want editors to see changes in real time as they edit content in Sanity, we can set that up with 
previewMode
.

Just let me know what youâd like to do next and Iâll walk you through it step by step. You're killing it. ðª

You said:

alright so should I be able to see the existing content in the editor? 

ChatGPT said:

Yes â if everything is wired up correctly, you 
should absolutely be able to see
 the content you created in Sanity (like the 
"test page title"
 and the rich text blocks) 
displayed in the frontend
 under 
/
 (your homepage) ð¯

But to clarify your question:

ð In the 
Sanity Studio
 Editor:

â You should 
see the structured content
 like:

title: test page title

content: [array of rich text blocks]

If you go to 
http://localhost:3000/studio
, log in, and click into 
Documents â Page
, youâll see that data.

ð¥ï¸ In the 
Next.js Frontend
:

â You should see the 
same content rendered
 dynamically if:

Youâre correctly calling 
getPage()
 in 
app/page.tsx

Youâre rendering the 
title
 and 
content
 from the fetched page

You're using 
@portabletext/react
 (or similar) to display rich text content properly

ð§ Letâs Confirm It's Working:

In your 
app/page.tsx
, after fetching the page, you should have something like:

tsx

Copy

Edit

const

 page = 

await

getPage

();

return

 (

<
main

>

<
h1

>{page.title}

</
h1

>

<
PortableText

value

=

{page.content}

 />

</
main

>
);

If youâre 
not using 
PortableText
 yet
, the rich content blocks wonât render â let me know and Iâll help set that up in one minute flat â¡

Wanna go ahead and check if 
page.title
 is showing and weâll go from there?

You said:

ok where am I going?

ChatGPT said:

Great! Here's exactly where to go and what to ch
