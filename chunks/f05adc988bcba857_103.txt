eck depending on what you're trying to confirm:

â 
1. To View/Edit Content in Sanity Studio

Go to:

ð 
http://localhost:3000/studio

(Or port 3001 if thatâs the one running.)

Steps:

Log in with your Sanity account.

In the left menu, click 
Page
 under âDocuments.â

You should see the "test page title" entry.

Click into it to see/edit the title and content blocks.

â 
2. To See the Content Rendered on Your Site (Frontend)

Go to:

ð 
http://localhost:3000

(Or again, 3001 depending on which one is active.)

This will show the frontend rendering
. You're checking:

Is the title (
test page title
) being shown?

Is any content from the Sanity editor being rendered?

ð¤ 
3. If You Donât See Content Yet

Letâs check if your 
app/page.tsx
 has this basic integration:

Example code:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { getPage } 

from

"@/lib/sanity"

import

 { 

PortableText

 } 

from

"@portabletext/react"

export

default

async

function

Home

(

) {

const

 page = 

await

getPage

()

return

 (

<
main

className

=

"container mx-auto py-10"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-4xl font-bold mb-4"

>{page.title}

</
h1

>

<
PortableText

value

=

{page.content}

 />

</
main

>
  )
}

If 
PortableText
 isn't installed yet:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install @portabletext/react

Let me know which step you're on and what youâre seeing â Iâll guide you through the rest ð¥

You said:

yes its still there but I am wondering where I see the main site that's rendering http://localhost:3000

ChatGPT said:

Ah, gotcha â you're asking:

Where do I find and edit the content thatâs rendering on 
http://localhost:3000
 â the main site?

Hereâs how to break that down:

ð The main site at 
http://localhost:3000
 is rendered from:

â 
app/page.tsx

This file is your homepage component, and it contains the JSX that builds out the full landing page â hero section, what/why/who sections, footer, etc.

ð§  Youâve connected Sanity CMS â so now the goal is:

Start replacing hardcoded content in 
app/page.tsx

 (like 
"Meet Symbi..."
, 
"What We Offer"
, etc.)

with dynamic content fetched from Sanity.

ð§­ Where to look/edit now

You said:

?

ChatGPT said:

Great question â hereâs your path forward ð¥

â 
Where you're currently seeing content:

Rendered on
: 

http://localhost:3000

Controlled by
: 
app/page.tsx

Currently hardcoded
: All the sections (Hero, What, Why, Who, etc.) are still static content written directly in JSX.

â 
Where your CMS content lives:

In 
Sanity Studio
 at 

http://localhost:3000/studio

Youâve created documents like:

page
 â with 
title
 and 
content
 rich text

â 
Where to go next:

Now that youâve wired up the Sanity client and 
getPage()
 fetch works:

ð¯ You want to replace 
hardcoded content
 in 
app/page.tsx
 with 
Sanity-powered content
 from 
getPage()
.

ð§ Quick Checklist

Make sure your Sanity schema is set up
 to include all fields youâll need â e.g., 
heroTitle
, 
heroDescription
, 
sections
, etc.

Update your GROQ query
 in 
lib/sanity.ts
 to fetch that data.

Replace static JSX content
 in 
app/page.tsx
 with dynamic variables from 
const page = await getPage()
.

Want me to help scaffold the GROQ query + dynamic JSX bindings?

I can refactor your 
getPage
 function and 
app/page.tsx
 to load Sanity content live. Just say the word ð

You said:

I don't know what any of that mean :( wasn't this the low code cloud option

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right â and no stress! ð You 
did choose the low-code cloud option
, and youâve already done the hard part: wiring up the Sanity CMS into your Next.js site. ðª
