Edited in Studio

Static Content

Hardcoded text and images

In 
app/page.tsx

â What You Want to Do

Replace hardcoded content (like âMeet Symbi, your intelligent AI assistantâ) with content from 
Sanity CMS
, so you can change it visually in the editor instead of in code.

ðª Whatâs Next (The Low-Code Part)

Iâll take care of the wiring for you. Hereâs how itâll work:

Iâll update your page code
 so it loads the data from Sanity.

You edit everything in the CMS
 â no more code changes just to update the text or headings.

â Let's Do It!

If you're ready, Iâll:

Update your 
lib/sanity.ts
 with the right query.

Refactor 
app/page.tsx
 to pull in content from Sanity.

Make sure it still matches the design you have now.

Just say:

"Yes, letâs wire it to Sanity!"

â¦and Iâll give you exactly the files to paste with full instructions. ðð«

ok I was just trying now to update the test page and I keep getting an error

ChatGPT said:

Got it â you're trying to update your test page in Sanity Studio, and it's throwing an error. Letâs fix this up.

To help you quickly, can you tell me:

â 
What exactly were you editing?
 (e.g., title, content block, etc.)

â 
What error message are you seeing?
 (copy-paste it or screenshot if easier)

ð¾ Did you hit "Publish" or just save the draft?

Also, if you added any custom fields or changed your schema (
schemas/page.ts
), let me know â sometimes a mismatch there causes Studio errors.

Once I see the error, Iâll guide you step-by-step to squash it! ð ï¸

just changing the title of the test page

2/2

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â thanks! If you're only changing the title and you're getting an error when you try to save or publish, then the issue is very likely 
either a schema mismatch or a Studio sync issue.

Letâs go step-by-step to troubleshoot this:

â 1. Confirm the schema has 
title
 defined

In 
schemas/page.ts
, make sure the field for 
title
 is defined like this:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { defineType, defineField } 

from

'sanity'

export

default

defineType

({

name

: 

'page'

,

type

: 

'document'

,

title

: 

'Page'

,

fields

: [

defineField

({

name

: 

'title'

,

type

: 

'string'

,

title

: 

'Title'

,
    }),

defineField

({

name

: 

'content'

,

type

: 

'array'

,

title

: 

'Content'

,

of

: [{ 

type

: 

'block'

 }],
    }),
  ],
})

â 2. Restart your local server

After making sure the schema is correct:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Let it compile fully, and then try editing the title again in Studio (
http://localhost:3000/studio
).

â 3. Still getting an error?

If yes, 
copy the exact error message youâre seeing
, and Iâll jump in with the precise fix.

ð¡ 
Bonus Tip
: If you've changed the schema but Studio hasn't picked it up, try clearing the 
.next
 cache:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf .next
npm run dev

Let me know what the error says if it's still popping up!

not even saving it yet Error: Request error while attempting to reach is https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/actions/production?tag=sanity.studio.document.commit

ChatGPT said:

Ah, that error message means your Sanity Studio 
cannot connect to the Sanity API
 â which typically happens when:

ð« 
CORS is not configured properly

Sanity blocks requests unless the origin (your localhost or domain) is explicitly allowed.

â 
Fix in 2 steps

1. Go to 

Sanity Manage

This is your project dashboard.

2. Add your local dev URL to the 
CORS Origins

In the 
API Settings
 section:

Click 
"Add CORS Origin"

Add:

arduino

Copy

Edit

http:

//localhost:3000

Check â 
Allow credentials

Save

Once thatâs added, 
restart your dev server
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Now your Studio at 
http://localhost:3000/studio
 should be able to 
successfully connect to Sanity
, and saving should work again.

Let me know when thatâs done â I can walk you thro
