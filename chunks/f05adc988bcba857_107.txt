Try editing and saving a document again.

If youâre still getting errors after that, weâll dig into API keys or firewall blocks â but this fix usually clears it. Ready to test again?

Thanks for confirming â since both 
http://localhost:3000
 and 
http://localhost:3001
 are already whitelisted in your CORS settings and the issue still persists, letâs run through a rapid-fire ð 
diagnostic checklist
 to pinpoint the cause.

â Quick Sanity Save Debug Checklist:

1. 
Token Permissions (If Using an API Token)

Are you using an API token (like in a 
.env.local
 or headers)? If so:

Make sure the token has 
write permissions

Go to 
Sanity Manage
, click your project â 
API
 tab â scroll to "Tokens"

If you're not using a token for local studio, skip this.

2. 
Check if You're Online

Since this is a 
networkError
, confirm:

ð You're connected to the internet

ð You can access 
https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/...
 in your browser (try opening it â it should show a JSON message if working)

3. 
Sanity Project Dataset Permissions

Run this in terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

npx sanity debug

Then check:

Is the 
dataset
 listed as 
production
?

Is it set to 
public
 or 
private
?

If it's private:

You 
must
 be logged into Sanity Studio

Or use an authenticated token

4. 
Sanity Studio Authentication

From the error, it looks like a request using an 
Authorization: Bearer
 header failed. Are you:

Editing the content 
as a logged-in user in Studio
?

If not logged in, 
click âLoginâ
 in the top-right of Studio and try again

ð  Final Debug Tactic (Flush Cache)

If all else fails, try flushing Sanityâs 
.sanity
 cache folder and reinstalling:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf .sanity node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev

Let me know what the 
npx sanity debug
 output says about your dataset and whether youâre logged in. Weâre close.

Great move checking with 
npx sanity debug
 â and this gives us the exact issue:

ð¨ Critical Issue:

css

Copy

Edit

Project config:
  { error: 

'Missing required "api.projectId" key'

 }

That means Sanity has 
no idea which project it's supposed to connect to
 â so it canât read/write anything.

â Solution: Fix 
sanity.config.ts

Open your 
sanity.config.ts
 and 
make sure the 
projectId
 and 
dataset
 are correctly set
, like this:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { defineConfig } 

from

"sanity"

;

import

 { deskTool } 

from

"sanity/desk"

;

import

 { visionTool } 

from

"@sanity/vision"

;

import

 page 

from

"./schemas/page"

;

export

default

defineConfig

({

name

: 

"default"

,

title

: 

"Symbi Studio"

,

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

, 

// â Replace with your actual Sanity project ID

dataset

: 

"production"

,

basePath

: 

"/studio"

,

plugins

: [

deskTool

(), 

visionTool

()],

schema

: {

types

: [page],
  },
});

If youâre not sure what your 
project ID
 is:

Go to 
Sanity Manage

Click into the âsymbiâ project

Copy the 
Project ID
 from the 
API
 tab
