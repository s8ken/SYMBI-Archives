Then create or open this file:

lua

.env.

local

You can create or edit it via terminal with:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano .env.local

Or, if you're using VS Code:

bash

Copy

Edit

ð Contents of 
.env.local

Paste the following:

env

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wryptr7v
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-02-19
SANITY_API_TOKEN=skYourCopiedTokenHere

ð Replace 
skYourCopiedTokenHere
 with the 
actual token
 you just generated from Sanity.

â After That

Save and close the file.

Restart your dev server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Try editing + saving again in 
http://localhost:3001/studio

Let me know when itâs added â Iâll help confirm itâs working.

Ah yep! Easy mistake â 
.env.local
 is a 
file
, not a command. Here's what you want to do instead:

â Create or Edit the 
.env.local
 File

From your terminal (and youâre already in the right folder):

bash

Copy

Edit

nano .env.local

That will open a file editor in the terminal.

ð Paste the following into that file:

env

Copy

Edit

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wryptr7v
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-02-19
SANITY_API_TOKEN=skYourCopiedTokenHere

Replace 
skYourCopiedTokenHere
 with the 
actual token
 you generated from Sanity (starts with 
sk...
).

ð¾ Then:

Press 
Control + X
 to exit.

Press 
Y
 to confirm saving.

Press 
Enter
 to write the file.

ð Finally, restart your dev server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

And youâre golden â¨ Let me know if you want to test the update/save flow again!

â Next Steps to Test It All

Now that the setup is live:

Head to 
http://localhost:3001/studio
 in your browser.

Try editing and saving that 
test page
 in Sanity Studio again.

Confirm that:

You can 
save
 the updated content (no API/network error).

It 
reflects
 on 
http://localhost:3001
 if your Next.js page is fetching from Sanity.

Let me know how the save goes. If it still errors out, weâll recheck the token scope or CORS â but it looks like weâre right on track ð

ð Quick Debug Checklist

â 1. 
Check Sanity Studio Route

You must have this file in your Next.js app:

bash

Copy

Edit

app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx

If that folder/file isnât there, create it like this:

bash

Copy

Edit

mkdir

Then inside that folder, create 
page.tsx
 with:

tsx

'use client'

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

'next-sanity/studio'

import

 config 

from

'../../../sanity.config'

export
