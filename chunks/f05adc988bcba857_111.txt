function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

=

{config}

 />
}

â 2. 
Double Check Your 
sanity.config.ts

Make sure it's at the root of your project (next to 
package.json
) and looks like this:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { defineConfig } 

from

'sanity'

import

 { deskTool } 

from

'sanity/desk'

import

 { visionTool } 

from

'@sanity/vision'

import

 siteSettings 

from

'./schemas/siteSettings'

import

 page 

from

'./schemas/page'

export

default

defineConfig

({

name

: 

'default'

,

title

: 

'Symbi Studio'

,

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

basePath

: 

'/studio'

,

plugins

: [

deskTool

(), 

visionTool

()],

schema

: {

types

: [siteSettings, page],
  },
})

â 3. 
Restart Dev Server

If you made any of those changes, restart Next.js:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Once thatâs confirmed, navigate to:

bash

Copy

Edit

http://localhost:3001/studio

It should now load your embedded Sanity Studio.

Let me know what happens next, and Iâll walk with you through the rest.

acutally it came back up

Perfect! ð That means everything is connected correctly now â Next.js, Sanity Studio, schema, and embedded route at 
/studio
.

â Next Steps (Optional but Recommended)

If you're ready to integrate CMS content into the main site:

Verify GROQ Queries
 â You already tested fetching data from Sanity.

Use your 
lib/sanity.ts

 to create functions like 
getPage()
:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient } 

from

'next-sanity'

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

apiVersion

: 

'2025-02-19'

,

useCdn

: 

false

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

 client.

fetch

(

`*[_type == "page"][0]`

)
}

Update 
app/page.tsx

 to consume that data:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { getPage } 

from

'@/lib/sanity'

export

default

async

function

Home

(

) {

const

 page = 

await

getPage

()

return

 (

<
main

>

<
h1

>{page?.title}

</
h1

>
      {/* Render other content as needed */}

</
main

>
  )
}

If you want to wire in dynamic CMS content into the homepage layout (e.g. 
what
, 
why
, 
who
 sections), I can help you update the schema + frontend too. Just say the word ð¬

Do you want to try that next?

Error: Request error while attempting to reach is https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/actions/production?tag=sanity.studio.document.commit

ChatGPT said:

Thanks for flagging â that error usually means 
Sanity Studio is unable to commit/publish content
, and itâs most often caused by:

ð« 
Missing or invalid API token

Your Sanity Studio client needs an 
API token with write permissions
 to commit data. Since you mentioned earlier that there was 
nothing in your tokens list
, thatâs likely the issue.

â Hereâs how to fix it:

1. 
Create a new API token
 in 
Sanity Manage

Go to your project: 
wryptr7v

Click 
Settings â API â Tokens

Create a 
new token
 with 
Editor
 or 
Write
 permissions

Copy it immediately
 (it wonât be shown again)

2. 
Update your 
.env.local
 file

In your 
symbi-main-site/.env.local
 file, add:

bash

Copy

Edit

SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_newly_copied_token

â Make sure you 
donât wrap it in quotes
 and 
no trailing spaces
.

3. 
Restart the dev server
 (important):

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Optional Debug

You can test if the token is working via a simple fetch using the 
@sanity/client
 instance and setting 
token: process.env.SANITY_API_TOKEN
.

Let me know when youâve added the token and restarted. Iâll help you verify itâs working.

You said:

no we just made it like 5 minutes ago

ChatGPT said:

Ah â perfect. If the token 
was just created
, but you're still seeing the 
Request error while attempting to reach
 message, here are the next steps to check:
