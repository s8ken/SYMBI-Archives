ot of your project and verify it includes:

env

Copy

Edit

SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk...   # The full token you just created

ð Make sure it's 
not wrapped in quotes

ð¡ Make sure there's 
no whitespace at the end

â Save the file

2. 
Your Sanity Client uses the token

In 
lib/sanity.ts
 (or wherever your client is defined), it 
must
 look like this:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

export

const

 sanityClient = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

apiVersion

: 

'2025-02-19'

, 

// or your version

useCdn

: 

false

,

token

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_TOKEN

, 

// ð¥ this must be here

})

3. 
Restart the Dev Server

This is critical so it picks up the token from 
.env.local
.

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

4. 
Check for typos in projectId or dataset

In 
sanity.config.ts
, make sure the values are exact:

ts

Copy

Edit

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,

dataset

: 

'production'

,

ð§ª Want to test it now?

Try going into 
http://localhost:3000/studio
 and editing + saving the test page.

If it 
still fails
, let me know:

What your 
.env.local
 file looks like (you can censor the token)

And the current contents of 
lib/sanity.ts

Iâll debug it instantly with you.

/sorry that file and I doing this time?

ChatGPT said:

No worries â let's walk through it 
step-by-step
 so you know exactly what file to check and what to do this time. Here's what you're doing and 
why it matters
:

ð ï¸ Youâre Updating: 
.env.local

This file holds 
private environment variables
, including the 
Sanity API token
 that allows editing content in the Studio (at 
/studio
).

â Step-by-Step Fix

1. 
Open 
.env.local
 file

In your project root (
symbi-main-site
), create or open the file named:

lua

Copy

Edit

.env.

local

If it doesnât exist:

bash

Copy

Edit

touch

 .env.local

2. 
Paste your Sanity token like this:

env

Copy

Edit

SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk4jQNIOJE1hrmV0LV98ULchrc6D8jUjqPYURxm9aMTVUU3x4twmOWlsQBbFdqFo92cvMmeDbEZUHzux

â Make sure there's no 
''
 or 
""
 wrapping it. Just plain text.

3. 
Save and Restart the Dev Server

After saving the file, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

You 
must restart
 so your app can read the 
.env.local
 values.

4. 
Test Saving Again in 
/studio

Go to: 
http://localhost:3000/studio

Try editing the test page title

Hit "Publish"

ð¬ Need Help Finding the Token?

If you forgot where the token is:

Go to 
https://www.sanity.io/manage

Click your project â API â 
Tokens

Create a new token with 
Editor
 or 
Write
 access

Let me know once you've done that or if you want me to walk you through finding the file/token again.

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â you're super close! Hereâs whatâs going on and what to do next:

ð What Just Happened?

â 
touch .env.local
 â â this 
created the file
 successfully.

â 
zsh: command not found: .env.local
 â Thatâs expected! 
.env.local
 is 
not a command or folder
, itâs a 
file
, so you don't run or 
cd
 into it.

â What You Need to Do Now

Letâs open and edit the file:

1. 
Open the file in your text editor (e.g., VS Code)

bash

Copy

Edit

code .env.local

If you're not using VS Code, you can also do:

bash

Copy

Edit

open -a TextEdit .env.local

2. 
Paste this into the file:

env

Copy

Edit

SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk4jQNIOJE1hrmV0LV98ULchrc6D8jUjqPYURxm9aMTVUU3x4twmOWlsQBbFdqFo92cvMmeDbEZUHzux

3. 
Save the file
 and close the editor.

4. 
Restart the development server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Now try editing and saving in Sanity Studio again. Let me know what happens!
