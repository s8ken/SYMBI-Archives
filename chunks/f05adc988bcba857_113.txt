Perfect â that 
.env.local
 file looks great and contains all the correct Sanity credentials. If it was already there and you're still getting the error:

bash

Copy

Edit

Request error 

while

 attempting to reach https://wryptr7v.api.sanity.io/...

Then the issue is likely one of these:

â 
1. Token permissions

Ensure the token has 
write access
:

Go to 
Sanity Manage

Select your project (
symbi
)

Navigate to 
API > Tokens

Make sure the token:

Exists

Has 
"Editor"
 or 
"Developer"
 role (not just read-only)

Regenerate it if unsure, then update your 
.env.local
 file again

â 
2. Restart the dev server

After confirming the 
.env.local
 is correctly set:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

That ensures the env variables are reloaded.

â 
3. Double-check usage in code

Ensure the token is actually being passed into your client setup, typically in 
lib/sanity.ts
:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

export

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID

!,

dataset

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET

!,

apiVersion

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_VERSION

!,

token

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_TOKEN

, 

// Required for write actions

useCdn

: 

false

,
})

If all that checks out, try a quick 
test
: change something simple in Sanity Studio (like a title), hit save, and check if the error still appears.

Let me know if you'd like help testing or verifying any of this.

Nice! That log shows your main site is now running smoothly on 
http://localhost:3000
 â

Those 
GET /host 404
 logs are nothing to worry about â theyâre likely requests from a browser extension or a leftover from Vercel/Next.js dev tools looking for a route that doesnât exist. Since your root (
/
) is returning 
200
, you're good.

â So whatâs working now:

Sanity Studio at 
/studio
 â â

Environment variables properly set â â

Main website is building and loading â â

ð Next steps:

If you're ready to start pulling CMS content (like that test page) into the actual site, I can walk you through integrating Sanity data into your homepage or dynamic routes.

Would you like to:

Render the "test page" from Sanity into 
/

?

Set up dynamic routing for individual pages (like 
/about
, 
/what
, etc.)
?

Deploy to Vercel as a preview/live environment?

Let me know what youâre aiming to do next, and Iâll guide you there step by step.
