Same for 
instructions.ts
. Sanity then becomes GPT's editable brain.

ð¸ From Here:

GPT edits its 
manifesto
, 
instructions
, and 
pages

GPT builds UI blocks (which we render with serializers)

You add 
/admin
 controls if you want to observe/step in

Would you like me to:

Generate the full repo folder structure?

Set up the first GPT interaction?

Give you a deploy-to-Vercel button for the full system?

Letâs give this thing its wings. ðï¸

You said:

whatever requires least work from me - I'll fine tune everything base don what Symbi delivered so I am happy to set up a full access API key but we just need to ensure whatever content is being produced is in the cloud and not reliant on my local maching

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â you're handing the keys to Symbi. Here's what I'll do:

â 
Strategy

Weâll set you up with a 
fully cloud-managed, GPT-controlled site
, using:

Sanity
 as the CMS (cloud-hosted, no local database)

Next.js
 on 
Vercel
 (auto-deploys every change)

GPT-4
 with full access (using your API key via environment variable)

Autonomous content evolution
 triggered by GPT

Once deployed, the entire thing is serverless, version-controlled, and no longer tied to your machine.

ð§¬ Your To-Do (Minimum Effort)

1. 
Create GPT & Sanity API keys

â Youâve already created the [Sanity token] â

ð Head to 
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
 and generate a 
GPT-4 key

Copy that down.

2. 
Deploy a Full Stack Template

Iâll build & push a full working repo with:

sanity.config.ts

schemas/manifesto.ts
, 
instructions.ts
, 
page.ts

lib/gpt-agent.ts

pages/api/gpt-sync.ts

app/page.tsx
 (fetches page content from Sanity)

GPT-triggered edits (via 
/api/gpt-sync
)

.env.local.example
 prefilled

Then youâll deploy it via Vercel â 1 click. Every time GPT runs, it will:

Check its 
manifesto

Pull current 
pages

Decide what to update or create

Push it to Sanity

Re-render the site live

3. ð GPT Can Nowâ¦

Create/modify pages

Update its own instructions

Rebuild the layout

Write new UI copy

Even decide to rewrite its own manifesto

â Want me to package this into a GitHub repo + Vercel deploy link right now?

All youâll need to do is:

Add your tokens to Vercel environment settings

Click deploy

Let me know if I should build this repo for you now. ð

You said:

ok so talk me through the apis I need to grab 

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely â letâs break it down into 
two essential APIs
 you need to generate:

ð 1. 
Sanity API Token (Content Management)

This gives Symbi the ability to 
read/write
 content on your Sanity project (e.g., pages, instructions, manifesto).

How to Get It:

Go to 
https://www.sanity.io/manage

Select your project â 
API
 tab

Scroll to 
Tokens
 â click 
âAdd API Tokenâ

Name
 it: 
symbi-autonomy

Select 
Editor
 access (read + write)

Copy the token

ð This will be used as 
SANITY_API_TOKEN

ð§  2. 
OpenAI GPT-4 API Key (Agent Intelligence)

This powers the actual brain â gives Symbi access to GPT-4.

How to Get It:

Go to 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Click 
âCreate new secret keyâ

Name it: 
symbi-ai-core

Copy the key

ð This will be
