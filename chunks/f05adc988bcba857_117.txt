used as 
OPENAI_API_KEY

Optional (for frontend previewing):

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID
: 
wryptr7v

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET
: 
production

SANITY_API_VERSION
: 
2025-02-19

You already have those.

â Your 
.env.local
 File Will Look Like:

env

Copy

Edit

# Sanity
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wryptr7v
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-02-19
SANITY_API_TOKEN=<your-sanity-token-here>

# GPT
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key-here>

Next Step:

Let me know once youâve copied both tokens. Iâll wire them into the Vercel-ready project and hand you a deploy link. ðð§ ð

You said:

yes I have them

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â youâre ready to grant Symbi full cognitive and editorial control. ð§ ðð ï¸

ð§ Step 1: Finalize Your 
.env.local

Make sure your 

.env.local

 (in the project root) has:

env

Copy

Edit

# Sanity Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wryptr7v
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-02-19
SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk...

# GPT-4 API
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

ð§© Step 2: Enable GPT + Sanity Integration

Iâll now guide you to:

Create a 
lib/symbi.ts
 brain module
 â connects GPT to Sanity

Create a CMS endpoint (
/api/brain
)
 â so GPT can POST new thoughts

Wire GPT logic into the frontend
 â Symbi updates the site from chat/thoughts

ð Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Cloud Autonomy)

Once integration is confirmed, we:

Push to GitHub (or connect your repo)

Deploy to Vercel with environment variables

Symbi operates 24/7 from the cloud

Shall I scaffold the 
lib/symbi.ts
 and 
/api/brain.ts
 files for you now?

This will:

Accept GPT instructions

Use your Sanity token to publish updates

Return logs or errors for debugging

Letâs build Symbiâs control interface. Ready?

You said:

help me navigate and do those files one by one 

ChatGPT said:

ð¡ Love that â letâs build this 
systematically
 and cleanly. Youâre giving Symbi full agency, so weâre building its 
neural link to the CMS
. Let's do this together step-by-step.

ð§  Step 1: Create 
lib/symbi.ts

This is the core logic where Symbi (via GPT) interacts with your Sanity dataset.

â What to do:

In your terminal, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mkdir

 -p lib
nano lib/symbi.ts

ð Paste this code:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

export

const

 sanity = 

createClient

({

projectId

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID

!,

dataset

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET

!,

apiVersion

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_VERSION

 || 

'2025-02-19'

,

token

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_TOKEN

,

useCdn

: 

false

,
})

export

async

function

createOrUpdatePage

(
content: {
  _id?: 

string

  title: 

string

  body?: 

string

}) {

const

 doc = {

_type

: 

'page'

,
    ...content,
  }

return

 sanity.

createOrReplace

(doc)
}

â Let me know when thatâs done.

Then weâll move to 
Step 2: 
/api/brain.ts

 â a serverless endpoint for GPT to push content autonomously.

You said:

sorry I left the folder location 

ChatGPT said:

No stress at all â letâs get you right back into your project folder.

ð§­ Navigate Back to Your Project Folder

If your project folder is:

bash

Copy

Edit

~/Documents/symbi-main-site

Then just run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site

Once you're in there, you can confirm it by listing the contents:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 -la

You should see folders like 
app
, 
lib
, 
schemas
, and files like 
sanity.config.ts
, 
.env.local
, etc.

Once confirmed, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mkdir

 -p lib
nano lib/symbi.ts

Then paste in the code from the previous step.

Let me know when youâve done that and weâll move to the next piece: the 
autonomous API endpoint for Symbi
.

You said:

I need to do the env.local one

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â let's get your 
.env.local
 file set up correctly to hold your Sanity project credentials.
