ð What to Look For

Successful Response (200 OK)
 with document ID

Check Sanity Studio
: You should see a new "Test from Symbi" page appear

If thereâs an error, Iâll help debug the response payload or the token permissions

Let me know how you want Symbi to initiate the connection â if youâre ready to test, I can help build the actual 
fetch()
 code it would use.
