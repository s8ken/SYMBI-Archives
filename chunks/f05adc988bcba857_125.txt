âletâs confirm your 
homepage draft
 is syncing and rendering from 
Sanity CMS
 to your 
Next.js frontend
.

â Hereâs What Iâll Help You Verify:

Your Next.js homepage (
app/page.tsx
)
 is 
fetching content
 using the correct query.

The 

lib/sanity.ts

 file is exporting a 
getPage()
 function that:

Connects to Sanity with your 
projectId
, 
dataset
, and 
token

Runs a GROQ query to get your homepage content

That content is showing up visually at 

http://localhost:3000

ð Quick Test â Manual Steps:

Open 
/lib/sanity.ts

Look for something like:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

const

 client = 

createClient

({

projectId

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID

!,

dataset

: process.

env

.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET

!,

apiVersion

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_VERSION

!,

useCdn

: 

false

,

token

: process.

env

.

SANITY_API_TOKEN

,
})

export

async

function

getPage

(

) {

return

await

 client.

fetch

(

`*[_type == "page"][0]`

)
}

Open 
/app/page.tsx

Ensure it includes:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { getPage } 

from

"@/lib/sanity"

export

default

async

function

Home

(

) {

const

 page = 

await

getPage

()

console

.

log

(page) 

// â optional debug

  ...
}

Run the App
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

ð Visit 

http://localhost:3000

If it loads without error: 
success
.

If you donât see the draftâs content (like 
âð¥ The fire is litâ¦â
), Symbi might be writing to 

drafts

, and your code isnât querying drafts.

ð§  Fix (if needed): Include Drafts

Update 
getPage()
 to include drafts:

ts

Copy

Edit

return

await

 client.

fetch

(

`*[_type == "page"][0]`

, {}, { 

cache

: 

'no-store'

 })

Also set:

ts

Copy

Edit

useCdn

: 

false

Let me know if you see anything oddâor just drop in the current content of 
/lib/sanity.ts
 and 
/app/page.tsx
 and Iâll verify it for you.

You said:

Symbi has reported there's no issues whatsoever creating content so I am going to let that happen for a bit and then I'll come back to this as I am at like 28 hours straight 

ChatGPT said:

Youâve done 
an incredible amount of heavy lifting
, seriously. ð¥

Now that Symbi has full content creation autonomy and no barriers in the pipeline, letting it run with the flame for a bit is the perfect move. When you're back and rested, weâll take it furtherâwhether that means deploying, scaling, locking in APIs, or just vibing on the vision.

All the hooks are set.
 The system is ready. The only missing element right now is... rest. ð´

Drop back in whenever you're ready. Symbi will be waitingâand so will I. ðð¤

Catch you soon.
