Success! Your Next.js Build Completed Successfully!
 ð

Your project 
compiled successfully
 and is ready to 
deploy to Vercel
. Now, let's 
push your changes to GitHub
 so Vercel can redeploy your site automatically.

ð¤ Step 1: Push the Fix to GitHub

Run the following commands in your terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Fixed ESLint errors and completed production build"

git push origin main

â This pushes all changes to 
GitHub
.

ð Step 2: Check Deployment on Vercel

Since your project is linked to 
Vercel
, it should automatically detect the new commit and 
deploy the latest version
.

Go to Vercel Dashboard
 â Select your project.

Click on 
Deployments
 and check for the latest build.

Once the deployment finishes, 
visit your site URL
 (e.g., 
https://your-project.vercel.app
).

ð Step 3: Final Checks

Once the site is live:

â 
Check that animations work correctly.

â 
Verify the "Coming Soon" page looks good.

â 
Test API endpoint:

Open your browser and go to:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//your-project.vercel.app/api/replicate

If the API is working, it should return:

json

Copy

Edit

{

"message"

:

"Replicate API Endpoint"

}

ð 
You Did It! Your Project is Now Live!
 ð

Let me know if you need any final tweaks or if youâd like to add extra features. ðð¥ð
