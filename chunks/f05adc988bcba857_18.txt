ð¨ Fixing the "Invalid Configuration" for 
symbi.world
 on GoDaddy

Your 
CNAME records look fine
, but I 
don't see an A record
 for 
symbi.world
. This is likely why Vercel is showing an "Invalid Configuration" error.

ð¹ Step 1: Add the Missing A Record

Go to 
GoDaddy DNS Management

.

Under 
DNS Records
, click 
"Add"
.

Set the A Record
:

Type
: 
A

Name
: 
@

Value
: 
76.76.21.21
 (Vercel's IP)

TTL
: 
1 Hour

Click 
Save
.

ð¹ Step 2: Verify and Refresh in Vercel

Go back to your Vercel Dashboard
.

Click 
Settings
 â 
Domains
.

Click 
Refresh
 next to 
symbi.world
.

Wait a few minutesâDNS changes may take 
up to 24 hours
, but usually, it's much faster.

ð Step 3: Check Propagation

Go to 

whatsmydns.net

.

Enter 
symbi.world
, select 
A Record
, and click 
Search
.

If it shows 

76.76.21.21

, the DNS is fully updated.

ð Once Fixed:

https://symbi.world
 will 
point to your Vercel site
.

https://www.symbi.world
 is already working correctly.

ð¨ Issue: Incorrect A Record IP Address

Your 
A record is incorrect
 because the value is 

76.76.21.2

, but it 
should be

76.76.21.21
.

ð¹ Step 1: Fix the A Record

Go to GoDaddy DNS Management.

Click Edit
 on the existing 
A
 record (
@
 pointing to 
76.76.21.2
).

Change the Value to
:

Copy

Edit

76.76.21.21

Save Changes
.

ð¹ Step 2: Remove Unnecessary A Records

If there are 
other A records
 for 
@
 (besides the corrected one), 
delete them
.

This ensures 
symbi.world

only points to Vercel
.

ð¹ Step 3: Verify on Vercel

Go to Vercel Dashboard â Domains.

Click 
Refresh
 next to 
symbi.world
.

Wait 
a few minutes
 for the DNS changes to propagate.

ð Step 4: Test the Domain

Open 

whatsmydns.net

.

Enter 
symbi.world
, select 
A Record
, and click 
Search
.

If it shows
