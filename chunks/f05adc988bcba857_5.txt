send me any new error logs

Let me know if anything else breaks!

You said:

it looks as intended locally - if I wanted to add a text animation (so eg letters typing) how would I do that?

ChatGPT said:

Great! Since your project is working as expected locally, let's 
add a text animation effect
 to create a 
typing effect
 for your text.

ð Adding a Typing Animation Effect

1ï¸â£ Install 
react-typical
 (Best for Simplicity)

To create a typing effect without manually coding animations, install 

react-typical

:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install react-typical

or

bash

Copy

Edit

yarn add react-typical

2ï¸â£ Use It in Your 
page.tsx

Modify your 

app/page.tsx

 to include the animation:

tsx

Copy

Edit

"use client"

;

import

Image

from

"next/image"

;

import

Typical

from

"react-typical"

;

export

default

function

Home

(

) {

return

 (

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"container max-w-4xl px-4 py-16 md:py-24 text-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"flex justify-center mb-8"

>

<
div

className

=

"relative w-40 h-40 md:w-[160px] md:h-[160px]"

>

<

=

=

"SYMBI Logo"

=

=

              />

</
div

</
div

          {/* Typing effect for the title */}

  );
}

ð¨ How It Works

The 
Typical
 component 
types and deletes words dynamically
.

The 
steps
 array defines the 
text
 and how long it appears (
in milliseconds
).

"SYMBI", 1000,
 â Displays 
SYMBI
 for 1 second.

"Welcome to SYMBI", 1500,
 â Changes to 
Welcome to SYMBI
 for 1.5 seconds.

"Coming Soon", 2000,
 â Types 
Coming Soon
 and holds for 2 seconds.

loop={Infinity}
 makes the animation repeat forever.

wrapper="span"
 ensures proper text styling.

3ï¸â£ (Optional) Use a CSS-Based Approach Instead

If you donât want to install an external package, you can use 
CSS animations
:

ð Add This in 
globals.css

css

Copy

Edit

@keyframes

 typing {

from

 {

width

: 

0

;
  }

to

 {

width

: 

100%

;
  }
}

.typing-container

 {

display

: inline-block;

overflow

: hidden;

white-space

: nowrap;

border-right

: 

2px

 solid white;

width

: 

0

;

animation

: typing 

3s

steps

(

20

, end) forwards;
}

ð Modify 
page.tsx

tsx

Copy

Edit

<h1 className=

"text-5xl md:text-7xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6 text-white typing-container"

>

SYMBI

</h1>

ð Deploy to Vercel

Once you're happy with the animation, push the changes to GitHub:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Added typing animation effect"

git push origin main

Vercel will 
automatically deploy
 your latest changes. ð

Would you like a more complex animation (like fade-in or color-changing text)? Let me know! ðð

cool so I want it to say the following on repeat infinity with fade in and out all in white.... SYMBI for 3 seconds, Intelligence Unbound 2 seconds, Hope 0.6 seconds, Unity 0.6 seconds, Humanity 0.5 seconds, 0.5 seconds, Peace 0.45 seconds, Equality 0.4 s
