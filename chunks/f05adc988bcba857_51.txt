ð Fixing the 
zsh: no matches found
 Error

You're getting 
"no matches found"
 because 
zsh
 is 
interpreting 
[[...index]]
 as special characters
 instead of a directory name.

â Solution: Use Quotes When Creating the Directory

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mkdir

 -p 

"app/studio/[[...index]]"

Now, create the file:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano 

"app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx"

â 
This will allow you to create the route without 
zsh
 errors.

ð Reminder: Paste This Inside 
page.tsx

After opening the file in Nano, paste this:

tsx

Copy

Edit

'use client'

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

'next-sanity/studio'

import

 config 

from

'../../../sanity.config'

export

default

function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

=

{config}

 />
}

Then 
save and exit:

Ctrl + X

Y

Enter

ð Next Steps

Now, start your project:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

â 
Open Sanity Studio:

http://localhost:3000/studio

â 
Check the website:
