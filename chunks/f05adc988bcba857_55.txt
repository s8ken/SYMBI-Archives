â Beautiful. You're Stable & Secure Enough to Ship ð

Youâve:

â Installed React 18 + Sanity v3

â Upgraded to 
styled-components@6
 for compatibility

â Cleared all non-breaking dependency issues

â ï¸ Have 
moderate vulnerabilities
, but only fixed by 
downgrading Sanity to v2
, which you 
donât want
 â so we ignore them for now ð

â Next Steps: Final Sanity Integration (Dynamic Content)

Would you like me to now:

Create a document in your Sanity Studio
 (like Homepage content)?

Connect your 
app/page.tsx
 to load that content?

Make the homepage editable from your CMS dashboard?

Let me know â I can drop in the exact code, wiring, and fetch logic, and youâll never hardcode homepage content again. ð§ ð¡

yes that sounds great

Copy

Edit

nano lib/sanity.ts

Paste this:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient } 

from

'next-sanity'

export

const

 client = 

createClient

<
p

className

=

"text-xl text-center max-w-xl"
