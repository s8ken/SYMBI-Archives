You said:

so can we deploy it and then start building a main site that will be a branch at go live?

ChatGPT said:

ð YES â Letâs Deploy Your Site & Set Up a âMainâ Branch for Launch

Youâre absolutely on point â hereâs what weâll do:

â 
1. Deploy to Vercel Now (Staging / Preview)

This will be your 
live preview environment
 while you build the full site. Youâll:

â Push your current site to GitHub

â Connect the repo to Vercel

â Auto-deploy on every commit

ð  
2. Then: Create a 
main-site
 Branch for Your Full Build

Youâll:

Work on your 
real homepage, nav, blog, about, etc.
 in 
main-site
 branch

Keep 
main
 as your minimal placeholder / landing page

Merge when ready for the world to see ð

ð Here's the Plan:

â Step 1: Push Your Local Project to GitHub (if not already)

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Initial deploy-ready commit"

git push origin main

â If your repo isnât connected to GitHub yet, I can walk you through creating it and pushing for the first time.

â Step 2: Go to Vercel & Connect Your GitHub Repo

Visit: 
https://vercel.com/dashboard

Click 
â+ Add New â Projectâ

Select your repo (
symbi
)

Click 
âDeployâ

Done ð

â Step 3: Create the 
main-site
 Branch Locally

bash

Copy

Edit

git checkout -b main-site

This will be your 
full site build branch
. You can now:

Start building nav, layout, pages

Add modular content and CMS support

Stay separate from your deployed 
main
 until you're ready

ð§  Optional:

Want me to help you:

Set up 
branch-based previews
 in Vercel?

Create a 
next-level CMS schema
 for modular sections?

Plug in 
your GPT model for content suggestions

tailwind.config.ts

so we already have this ready its in the same style as the coming soon page 

ChatGPT said:

ð¥ You've Already Built the Main Site â and It Looks Awesome!

That new 
page.tsx
 is 
full-featured, clean, and branded
 â ready to go live. So here's how we finalize the structure:

â Step 1: Deploy the "Coming Soon" Page as 
main

This is already done â â your 
main
 branch is:

Simple

Lightweight

Branded

Connected to Sanity

Thatâs your 
staging / soft-launch
 site (i.e., 

symbi.world

 â)

ð Step 2: Move This Full Site to a New Branch (
main-site
)

Run this locally:

bash

Copy

Edit

git checkout -b main-site

Then:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Full site structure ready"

git push origin main-site

â Your GitHub will now have:

main
 â Current live site (Coming soon)

main-site
 â Full experience, building in parallel

ð Step 3: Set Up Vercel Preview for 
main-site

Go to 
Vercel Dashboard

Open your 
Symbi
 project

Go to 
Settings â Git

Ensure 
"Automatically deploy new branches"
 is 
enabled

Vercel will create a preview like:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//main-site-symbi.vercel.app

You can use this to:

Preview your full site

Share it with collaborators

QA everything before launch

ð§  Optional: Schedule a Switch

When you're ready to go live:

bash

Copy

Edit

git checkout main
git merge main-site
git push origin main

â Boom â your
