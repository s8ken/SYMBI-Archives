â¨ Ready for Next Steps?

I can now:

ð¨ Help style dynamic blocks via Sanity (make the full site editable)

ð Wire up nav, content, pricing, etc. from Studio

ð¤ Add GPT-4-based editing assistant into your CMS

Let me know what you want next. You're in launch shape, my friend ðªð¥

Where to Place the Files You Uploaded

Your files are 
ready to be integrated
 into your 
main-site
 branch. Here's where they should go in your project:

ð 
1. Move 
globals.css
 (Styles)

This should go in:

bash

Copy

Edit

./styles/globals.css

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mv

 /mnt/data/globals.css styles/globals.css

â 
Ensures your Tailwind and global styles apply correctly.

ð 
2. Move 
layout.tsx
 (Page Layout)

This file should be inside:

bash

Copy

Edit

./app/layout.tsx

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mv

 /mnt/data/layout.tsx app/layout.tsx

â 
This controls the global structure of the site (header, footer, etc.).

ð 
3. Move 
page.tsx
 (Homepage)

Place this in:

bash

Copy

Edit

./app/page.tsx

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mv

 /mnt/data/page.tsx app/page.tsx

â 
This is the main landing page.

ð 
4. Move 
tailwind.config.ts
 (Tailwind Setup)

Since Tailwind config files live at the project root, move it here:

bash

Copy

Edit

./tailwind.config.ts

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mv

 /mnt/data/tailwind.config.ts tailwind.config.ts

â 
Ensures Tailwind works correctly with the new UI.

ð 
Final Steps to Apply the Changes

After placing the files correctly:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Integrated main-site design"

git push origin main-site

Then check the preview at:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//main-site-symbi.vercel.app

You said:

alright so I just created a new project folder in documents called symbi-main-site

Great! Setting Up 
symbi-main-site
 as Your Full Project

Now that youâve created a 
separate project folder
, weâll set it up 
correctly as a branch-based workflow
.

â 
Step 1: Clone the Repo Into Your New Folder

Since 
symbi-main-site
 is a full build, we need to 
clone your GitHub repo inside it
.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site
git 

clone

 https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/symbi.git .
git checkout -b main-site

â This does:

Clones your existing 
symbi
 repo

Switches to a 
new 
main-site
 branch
 for your 
full build

â 
Step 2: Move Your Files into This New Project

Now 
move the files you uploaded
 into 
symbi-main-site
:

bash

Copy

Edit

mv

 /mnt/data/globals.css styles/globals.css

mv

 /mnt/data/layout.tsx app/layout.tsx

mv

 /mnt/data/page.tsx app/page.tsx

mv

 /mnt/data/tailwind.config.ts tailwind.config.ts

â 
Now your design & structure are in the correct place.

â 
Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install

â This ensures 
Tailwind, Sanity, Next.js, and all other dependencies
 are installed.

â 
Step 4: Start Your Dev Server

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Then check:

ð¥ï¸ 
Main Site Preview
 â 

http://localhost:3000

ð§  
Sanity Studio (if enabled)
 â 

http://localhost:3000/studio

â 
Step 5: Push 
main-site
 to GitHub

Once itâs working:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Initial main-site full build"

git push origin main-site

Vercel should now 
automatically detect & deploy
 a preview:

arduino

Copy

Edit

https:

//main-site-symbi.vercel.app

If not, I can guide you through 
enabling branch-based previews
.
