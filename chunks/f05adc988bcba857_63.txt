ð¨ Git Wonât Clone Because the Directory Isnât Empty

You're trying to clone into 
.
 (current directory), but 
symbi-main-site
 already has files (maybe a 
package.json
 or 
node_modules
).

â 
Option 1: Clean the Folder First (Recommended if it's empty/test files)

If you 
donât have important changes
 in 
symbi-main-site
, just wipe it clean:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf ./*

rm

 -rf .git

Then clone fresh:

bash

Copy

Edit

git 

clone

 https://github.com/s8ken/symbi.git .
git checkout -b main-site

ð§  
Option 2: Clone into a New Folder Instead

If youâd rather not wipe, just clone into a new folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents
git 

clone

 https://github.com/s8ken/symbi.git symbi-main-site-full

cd

 symbi-main-site-full
git checkout -b main-site

Then move your 
layout.tsx
, 
page.tsx
, etc., into the correct places here.

â Once Thatâs Done:

npm install

npm run dev

Confirm everything works

Then:

bash

Copy

Edit

git add .
git commit -m 

"Set up full site on main-site branch"

git push origin main-site

You said:

so 'symbi' currently has the coming soon content no?

ChatGPT said:

â 
Exactly â You're Right!

Your GitHub repo 
s8ken/symbi
 currently has:

Branch: 
main

Contains your 
âComing Soonâ landing page
, fully styled and deployed (likely to Vercel via 
main
).

ð§  So Your Setup Right Now:

Folder / Branch

Purpose

Status

symbi
 (GitHub repo)

Deployed âComing Soonâ site

â Live on Vercel

main
 branch

Simple landing page

â Working

symbi-main-site

Your 
future full website

ð Building now

main-site
 branch

New branch youâre about to create

ð¡ Coming next

ð¥ Hereâs the Cleanest Flow From Here

â Option: Connect Your 
symbi-main-site
 to the Same Repo as a New Branch

Since you already have a local folder with your full site (
symbi-main-site
), just make it part of the same repo.

â Steps (Just Once):

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site

rm

 -rf .git              

# wipe local git history

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/s8ken/symbi.git
git checkout -b main-site
git add .
git commit -m 

"Full site main-site branch setup"

git push -u origin main-site

ð After That:

main-site
 will exist on GitHub

Vercel will auto-deploy a preview like:

https://main-site-symbi.vercel.app

You can work freely in 
main-site
, then merge into 
main
 when you're ready for the big reveal ð
