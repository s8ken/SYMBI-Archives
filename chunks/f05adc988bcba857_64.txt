Make it CMS-editable in Sanity?

ð¥ Letâs Make Your Logo CMS-Editable via Sanity Studio

This means: you (or anyone non-technical) can change the logo image right inside your Studio â no code edits, no Git commits.

â Step 1: Add a 
siteSettings
 Schema

Create the file:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano schemas/siteSettings.ts

Paste this schema:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { defineType, defineField } 

from

'sanity'

export

default

defineType

({

name

: 

'siteSettings'

,

title

: 

'Site Settings'

,

type

: 

'document'

,

fields

: [

defineField

({

name

: 

'logo'

,

title

: 

'Logo Image'

,

type

: 

'image'

,
    }),

defineField

({

name

: 

'tagline'

,

title

: 

'Tagline'

,

type

: 

'string'

,
    }),
  ],
})

â Step 2: Register It in 
sanity.config.ts

Open:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano sanity.config.ts

Update the 
schema.types
 array to include both 
page
 and 
siteSettings
:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 page 

from

'./schemas/page'

import

 siteSettings 

from

'./schemas/siteSettings'

schema

: {

types

: [page, siteSettings],
},

â Step 3: Create Your Logo in Studio

Go to 

http://localhost:3000/studio

Click â "New" â Choose 
Site Settings

Upload your logo

(Optional) Add a tagline

Click 
Publish
 â

â Step 4: Update 
layout.tsx
 to Use CMS Logo

Open:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano app/layout.tsx

Add this to the top:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { client } 

from

'@/lib/sanity'

async

function

getLogoUrl

(

) {

const

 data = 

await

 client.

fetch

(
`*[_type == "siteSettings"][0]{
    logo{asset->{url}}
  }`
)

return

 data?.

logo

?.

asset

?.

url

}

Then inside your 
RootLayout
, modify where your logo is rendered:

tsx

Copy

Edit

const

 logoUrl = 

await

getLogoUrl

(

)

{logoUrl && (

<
Image

src

=

{logoUrl}

alt

=

"Logo"

width

=

{160}

height

=

{160}

className

=

"rounded-lg object-cover"

  />
)}

â Boom â your logo now loads live from Sanity ð
