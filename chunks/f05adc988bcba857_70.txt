Fix: 
metadata
 Cannot Be Used in a 
"use client"
 Component

Next.js 
does not allow exporting 
metadata
 inside a client component
 (
"use client";
). Since we added 
"use client";
 in 
layout.tsx
, the 
metadata must be moved
.

â 
Solution: Move 
metadata
 to a Separate File

1ï¸â£ 
Create a new metadata file

bash

Copy

Edit

nano app/metadata.ts

Paste this:

ts

Copy

Edit

export

const

 metadata = {
