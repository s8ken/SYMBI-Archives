Now it should 
no longer give a 404 error

Try this and let me know if 
/studio
 loads properly now!

Could not open page.tsx in the editor.
The editor process exited with an error: (code 1).

To set up the editor integration, add something like REACT_EDITOR=atom to the .env.local file in your project folder and restart the development server.

Fix: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'next-sanity/studio'"

Your project is 
missing 
next-sanity

, which is required to run 
Sanity Studio inside Next.js
.

â 
Step 1: Install 
next-sanity

Run the following command in your project folder:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install next-sanity

If you continue to get dependency errors, try this instead:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install next-sanity --legacy-peer-deps

â 
Why?
 This installs 
next-sanity
, which includes the missing 
next-sanity/studio
 module.

â 
Step 2: Restart Your Server

After installation, restart the Next.js development server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Then go to:

ð 

http://localhost:3001/studio

ð¥ 
What If It Still Fails?

1ï¸â£ 
Confirm the installation

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm list next-sanity

If itâs missing, install it again.

2ï¸â£ 
Delete 
node_modules
 & Reinstall Everything

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run dev

ð 
Final Steps

After installing 
next-sanity
, 
/studio

should no longer show a 500 error.

If anything still isnât working, 
send me the latest error log
 and Iâll debug further.

Try this and let me know! ðð¥
