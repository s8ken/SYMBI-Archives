ð¨ Vercel Deployment Failed: 
app/api/replicate/route.ts
 Type Error

Your 
Next.js build failed
 because of an issue with 

app/api/replicate/route.ts

.

The error message:

"File '/vercel/path0/app/api/replicate/route.ts' is not a module."

This means 
Next.js cannot properly recognize or import this file
. Let's fix it!

ð Step 1: Identify the Issue

Possible Causes

Incorrect or missing TypeScript export in 
route.ts
.

Incorrect API route structure.

A syntax or TypeScript error in 
app/api/replicate/route.ts
.

ð§ Step 2: Fix the Issue

1ï¸â£ Check 
route.ts
 Exports

Open

app/api/replicate/route.ts
 in your editor.

Ensure it 
properly exports a Next.js API route
:

â 
Correct Format (
route.ts
)

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { 

NextResponse

 } 

from

"next/server"

;

export

async

function

POST

(

req: Request

) {

try

 {

const

 body = 

await

 req.

json

();

// Example: Log input data (modify as needed)

console

.

log

(

"Replicate API Request:"

, body);

return

NextResponse

.

json

({ 

success

: 

true

, 

message

: 

"Replicate API is working!"

 });
  } 

catch

 (error) {

return

NextResponse

.

json

({ 

success

: 

false

, 

error

: 

"Error processing request."

 }, { 

status

: 

500

 });
  }
}

ð¹ 
Ensure 
export async function POST(req: Request) {}
 is present.

ð¹ If you're using 
GET
, make sure it's exported as 
export async function GET() {}
.

2ï¸â£ Ensure Correct File Naming

The API route should be inside:

app/api/replicate/route.ts

â Wrong:

app/api/replicate.ts
 (should be inside 
replicate/
)

app/api/replicate/index.ts
 (Next.js expects 
route.ts
)

â Correct:

markdown

Copy

Edit

app/
  api/

    replicate/
      route.ts

3ï¸â£ Check for TypeScript Issues

Run this command locally 
before pushing
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run build

or

bash

Copy

Edit

yarn build

ð¹ If it 
fails locally
, it will also fail on Vercel.

ð¹ 
Fix any errors
 shown in the terminal.

ð Step 3: Push the Fix & Deploy Again

Once fixed:

Stage & commit the fix
:
