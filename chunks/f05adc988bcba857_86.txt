Great, you've cleaned the cache and reinstalled dependencies. Now let's 
install the missing Sanity core packages
 and get everything running.

â 
Step 1: Install Sanity Core Packages

Now, install the 
Sanity-related dependencies
:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm install sanity @sanity/vision @sanity/client @sanity/image-url next-sanity --legacy-peer-deps

This will ensure you have:

sanity
 â Core Sanity SDK

@sanity/vision
 â Query testing tool

@sanity/client
 â Fetch content in your app

@sanity/image-url
 â Handle images dynamically

next-sanity
 â Next.js-friendly Sanity integration

â 
Step 2: Restart the Server

After installation, restart your development server:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Then check:

ð 

http://localhost:3001/studio

ð¯ 
Expected Outcome

If the Sanity Studio 
loads successfully
, we're good to go!

If there's 
another error
, copy it here and I'll troubleshoot further.

ð 
You're almost there! Let me know the result.

Sanity Studio running
 ð.

â 
Step 1: Start Your Next.js Server

Make sure the 
Sanity Studio route exists
.

ð Open 
app/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx

Paste this:

tsx

Copy

Edit

"use client"

;

import

 { 

NextStudio

 } 

from

"next-sanity/studio"

;

import

 config 

from

"../../../sanity.config"

export

default

function

StudioPage

(

) {

return

<
NextStudio

config

{config}

 />;
}

Save & exit:

Press 
CTRL + X

Press 
Y

Hit 
Enter

Then 
restart your server

No 
module not found
 errors for 
sanity

â
