ty Studio to Your Vercel Deployment

Eventually, we can:

Deploy the Studio to something like 
studio.symbi.world

Protect it with login

Let collaborators edit content easily

Just say the word on what you want to do next â edit schema, build dynamic frontend, or go live â Iâve got your back all the way. ð¥

You said:

lets check - what should I be seeing in there now?

ChatGPT said:

Great question â letâs check what you 
should
 be seeing now that your 
Sanity Studio is running
:

â 
Expected Dashboard at 
http://localhost:3001/studio

Your Studio should show:

ð§­ Left Sidebar Navigation:

ð 
âPageâ
 â because of the 
page
 schema you added

âï¸ 
âSite Settingsâ
 â if youâve also included 
siteSettings.ts
 in the schema config

Each of these links lets you create and manage documents of that type.

ð 
When You Click on âPageâ

You should be able to:

Click 
âCreate newâ

See a form with:

Title
 field (text input)

Content
 field (rich text editor)

If that's there â it means the schema is wired up correctly.

ð 
Optional: Check Your Schema Config

Open 
sanity.config.ts
 and ensure it has this:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { defineConfig } 

from

"sanity"

;

import

 { deskTool } 

from

"sanity/desk"

;

import

 { visionTool } 

from

"@sanity/vision"

;

import

 page 

from

"./schemas/page"

;

import

 siteSettings 

from

"./schemas/siteSettings"

; 

// â only if this file exists

export

default

defineConfig

({

name

: 

"default"

,

title

: 

"Symbi Studio"

,

projectId

: 

"wryptr7v"

,

dataset

: 

"production"

,

basePath

: 

"/studio"

,

plugins

: [

deskTool

(), 

visionTool

()],

schema

: {

types

: [page, siteSettings], 

// â include both if needed

  },
});

â Confirm for Me:

Do you see âPageâ (and optionally âSite Settingsâ) in the sidebar?

Can you create a new entry and fill in title + content?

Letâs verify itâs all good â or Iâll patch up anything missing!

ChatGPT said:

This looks perfect! ð

â 
What You Have:

Sanity Studio is running.

Sidebar:

âPageâ
 is visible â

âSite Settingsâ
 is visible â

Main Content Area:

Search bar â

No documents yet (thatâs expected) ð

ð¥ 
Next Steps:

1ï¸â£ 
Create a New Page

Click 
â (plus sign)

Fill in the 
Title
 and other fields

Click 
Publish

2ï¸â£ 
Check if the data appears in API

Open 
Sanity Vision
 (top-right)

Run:

js

Copy

Edit

*[_type == 

"page"

]

If you see results, that means the CMS is working! ð

3ï¸â£ 
Fetch Sanity Data in Next.js

Now we can make sure your 
Next.js frontend
 fetches this data dynamically.

Let me know if we should 
connect the frontend to Sanity next!
 ð

You said:

so do I add that command to 'query'

ChatGPT said:

Yes! To check if your data is stored correctly in Sanity, follow these steps:

ð How to Run a Query in Sanity Vision

1ï¸â£ 
Go to "Vision" Tab
 (top-right in your Sanity Studio).

2ï¸â£ 
Enter the Query:

js

Copy

Edit

*[_type == 

"page"

]

3ï¸â£ 
Click "Run Query"

â Expected Output

If you have created a page entry, you should see JSON data like this:

json

Copy

Edit

[

{

"_id"

:

"abc123"

,

"_type"

:

"page"

,

"title"

:

"Home"

,

"slug"

:

{

"current"

:

"home"

}

,

"content"

:

"This is my home page content"

}

]

If you see 
an empty array 
[]

, it means you havenât added a page yet.

ð¥ Next Steps

If you see results
: Your data is stored correctly. We can now 
fetch it in Next.js
.

If no results
: Try creating a 
new page
 in the "Page" section and re-run the query.

Let me know what you see! ð
