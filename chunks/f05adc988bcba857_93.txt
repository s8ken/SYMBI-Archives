's walk through this step-by-step!

â 1. 
Check if 
lib/sanity.ts
 Already Exists

Run this in your terminal from the root of your project:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

 lib

If you see 
sanity.ts
 listed, it already exists. You can then open it to inspect:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano lib/sanity.ts

â 2. 
Create 
lib/sanity.ts
 (If It Doesnât Exist)

If the file 
does not exist
, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

mkdir

 -p lib && nano lib/sanity.ts

Then paste the following code into 
lib/sanity.ts
:

ts

Copy

Edit

import

 { createClient } 

from

'@sanity/client'

export

const

 sanityClient = 

createClient

({

projectId

: 

'wryptr7v'

,         

// your Sanity project ID

dataset

: 

'production'

,         

// your dataset

apiVersion

: 

'2023-01-01'

,      

// use a specific date to lock the API version

useCdn

: 

true

// `true` enables faster response for public content

})

Once pasted, save the file:

Press 
Ctrl + O
, then 
Enter
 to save.

Press 
Ctrl + X
 to exit nano.

Let me know once thatâs done and Iâll guide you on integrating it in 
app/page.tsx
.

Perfect! ð Now that 
lib/sanity.ts
 is set up, letâs wire it into your homepage.

â 3. 
Update 
app/page.tsx
 to Fetch from Sanity

Open the file:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano app/page.tsx

Then follow these steps:

ð At the top, import the Sanity client:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

 { sanityClient } 

from

"@/lib/sanity"

;

ð Add this fetch function 
before
 the component:

tsx

Copy

Edit

async

function

getPageData

(

) {

const

 query = 

`*[_type == "page"]{ title, content }`

;

return

await

 sanityClient.

fetch

(query);
}

ð Update your component to fetch and render the data:

tsx

Copy

Edit

export

default

async

function

Home

(

) {

const

 pages = 

await

getPageData

();

return

 (

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black"

>

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"container max-w-4xl px-4 py-16 md:py-24 text-center"

>

<
div

className

=

"flex flex-col items-center mb-8"

>

<
h1

className

=

"text-8xl font-bold text-white mb-6"

>SYMBI

</
h1

>

<
div

className

=

"relative w-40 h-40 md:w-[160px] md:h-[160px]"

>

<
Image

src

=

"/symbi-logo.jpg"

alt

=

"SYMBI Logo"

fill

className

=

"rounded-lg object-cover"

priority

sizes

=

"(max-width: 768px) 160px, 160px"

              />

</
div

>

</
div

>

          {/* Render Sanity Content */}
          {pages.map((page, index) => (

<
div

key

=

{index}

className

=

"text-white mt-8"

>

<
h2

className

=

"text-3xl font-semibold mb-2"

>{page.title}

</
h2

>
              {page.content?.map((block: any, i: number) => (

<
p

key

=

{i}

className

=

"text-lg"

>
                  {block.children?.[0]?.text}

</
p

>
              ))}

</
div

>
          ))}

</
div

>

</
main

>

</
div

>
  );
}

â 4. Save and Restart

If editing in 
nano
:

Press 
Ctrl + O
, then 
Enter

Press 
Ctrl + X

Then run your dev server if itâs not already running:

bash

Copy

Edit

npm run dev

Go to: 
http://localhost:3001

You should now see the content from your Sanity CMS rendered dynamically on your site below the logo!

Let me know what you see ð and Iâll help from there!

You said:

do you know where the component is based on what I shared earlier?

ChatGPT said:

Yes â based on what you previously shared and uploaded, your 
animated content
 (like the typing words) and structure for 
SYMBI
 and the logo were all located inside the main layout of 
app/page.tsx
.

Hereâs the breakdown based on your last working version:

â 
Structure Summary

Inside 
app/page.tsx
, your component looked like this:

<div className=

"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-black"

<
main

className

=

"flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"
