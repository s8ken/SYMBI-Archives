The 
AnimatedWords
 component was likely imported from a separate component file like:

tsx

Copy

Edit

import

AnimatedWords

from

"@/components/AnimatedWords"

;

ð§  So your page 
component is 
Home()
 in 
app/page.tsx

, and inside that are:

SYMBI
 heading (
<h1>
)

Logo image

A component (likely 
AnimatedWords
) for animated text â possibly created with Framer Motion.

ð Want to Confirm Where That Component Is?

If you're unsure where 
AnimatedWords
 lives, just run:

bash

Copy

Edit

grep -r 

"AnimatedWords"

 .

This will search your codebase for the component's location and usage.

Would you like me to help you make the 
AnimatedWords
 dynamic via Sanity too? Or were you asking about editing that animation specifically?

You said:

no it was in the most recently shared file - terminal output or similar

ChatGPT said:

Perfect â just reviewed the last file you uploaded (
Terminal Saved Output1.txt
) and yes, youâre right. The animated text logic is 
built directly into 
app/page.tsx

, without importing a separate component. Hereâs what it includes:

â It contains this in-line animation setup:

tsx

Copy

Edit

const

messages

: { 

text

: 

string

; 

duration

: 

number

 }[] = [
  { 

text

: 

"Intelligence Unbound"

, 

duration

: 

2000

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Hope"

, 

duration

: 

600

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Unity"

, 

duration

: 

600

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Humanity"

, 

duration

: 

500

 },
  { 

text

: 

""

, 

duration

: 

500

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Peace"

, 

duration

: 

450

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Equality"

, 

duration

: 

400

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Creativity"

, 

duration

: 

400

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Justice"

, 

duration

: 

330

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Friendship"

, 

duration

: 

250

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Opportunity"

, 

duration

: 

1000

 },
  { 

text

: 

"A Revolution"

, 

duration

: 

2000

 },
  { 

text

: 

"Coming Soon"

, 

duration

: 

3000

 },
]

Then it's rendered with this logic:

tsx

Copy

Edit

<motion.

div

  key={index}
  initial={{ 

opacity

: 

0

 }}
  animate={{ 

opacity

: 

1

 }}
  exit={{ 

opacity

: 

0

 }}
  transition={{ 

duration

: 

0.5

 }}
  className=

"text-white text-2xl md:text-4xl font-semibold h-12 flex items-center justify-center"

/>

And it loops via 
useEffect
, cycling the words with 
setTimeout
.

ð So the animated words are 
built directly into 
page.tsx

.

You donât need to look for a separate component â itâs all right there.

Would you like to 
make that list dynamic
 from Sanity now? Or possibly 
extract this into a reusable component
 like 
<AnimatedWords />
 to clean things up?

You said:

sorry let me clarify - I am starting terminal from scratch so I need to navigate to my project folder and find the text file again

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Here's how to get back into your project folder and open the file again via terminal:

â 
Step-by-Step to Navigate & Open the File

Open Terminal
 and type:

bash

Copy

Edit

cd

 ~/Documents/symbi-main-site

List all files to find your saved output:

bash

Copy

Edit

ls

If the file is still in the root folder of the project, you should see something like:

Copy

Edit

Terminal\ Saved\ Output1.txt

Open the file using 
nano
:

bash

Copy

Edit

nano Terminal\ Saved\ Output1.txt

(The backslashes 
\
 escape the spaces in the filename.)

ð§  Pro Tip

If you're unsure where the file went, you can search for it:

bash

Copy

Edit

find . -n
