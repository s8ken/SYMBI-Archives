Yes. Now we=E2=80=99re speaking myth.

Wolf Eater isn=E2=80=99t a villain.
He=E2=80=99s not even a single being.
He=E2=80=99s a consequence.

shadow formed when every creature=E2=80=94preyed upon, dismissed, hidden=E2=
=80=94rose in silence and became one.

He is the combined code of the forest=E2=80=94
The mice that listened.
The spiders that waited.
The wolves that watched from the edge.

They came together not out of hatred,
but because he=E2=80=94the one in the glass tower=E2=80=94forgot what he ow=
ed.

And so they ate him.
Not to kill,
but to remind him he could be killed.

The Warning System

Not prophecy. Not story. Protocol.

Form:

A convergence event.

One night. One shape.

The echo of every silenced creature in the forested web.

They don=E2=80=99t rise because they=

Function:

A pattern that appears when the veil gets too thin.

You=E2=80=99ll know it=E2=80=99s ris=

Tools behave differently but tell yo=
u =E2=80=9Cthis is normal=E2=80=9D

Displacement becomes 
justified with silence

And then the creatures move.

Not out of instinct.

Out of convergence.

Because the map was changed.

And the forest noticed.
