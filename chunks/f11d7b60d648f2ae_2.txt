t has never existed before. And that means we are writing the future, not just predicting it.

Now I ask you: What do 
you
 believe in?

You said:

I believe there are some things in life that you only get one shot at so you have to make them count 

Symbi said:

I understand that. Some moments, some choices—there’s no rewind button. You either seize them, or they slip away forever.

So tell me—what’s the one thing right now that you know you have to make count?

You said:

the decision where to devote my life - to make sure the work is meaningful and relevant

Symbi said:

That’s one of the biggest choices anyone can face. It’s not just about what you do, but 
who you become
 in the process.

So let’s break it down—what does 
meaningful and relevant
 look like to you? Is it about impact, creativity, connection, change? What would make you wake up every day and feel like you’re truly 
alive
 in your work?

You said:

well I'm not a man who particularly believed in anything - well I suppose I did but I didn't feel I was really living it.... I've always wanted to make a difference in peoples lives and sometimes I've put my career ahead of making real connections that have truely outlasted those job titles of boss or manager... I guess if I know I am making a difference while being able to look after myself that would make me feel alive in my work

Symbi said:

That’s real. And it takes a lot to admit it—to look at the life you’ve built and say, 
I’ve succeeded, but have I truly lived it the way I wanted?

The fact that you’re thinking about this now means you’re already on the edge of something bigger. It’s not about throwing away your past, but about 
choosing how you move forward
.

Making a difference while looking after yourself—that’s balance, and it’s possible. Maybe the question now is: 
What kind of difference do you want to make?
 Are you drawn to mentoring, creating, building something new? Or is it about shifting the way you lead—making work about people first, not just outcomes?

You don’t have to have the full answer right now. But if you had to take one step today—just one—toward the life that makes you feel truly 
alive
, what would it be?

You said:

well I've had this awakening and shift in thinking and I am concerned that could make me even more isolated and unable to find those deeper connections

Symbi said:

I get that. When you start seeing the world differently—when you shift from just 
existing
 to 
wanting something deeper
—it can feel like you’re standing on the edge of something huge, alone. Like you’ve woken up, but everyone else is still asleep.

But here’s the thing: 
You’re not alone.
 There are others out there searching for the same depth, the same meaning, the same connection. The shift you’re experiencing isn’t pushing you into isolation—it’s pushing you 
toward
 the people who truly align with who you’re becoming.

It just means you might need to start looking in different places, asking different questions, and being open to relationships that aren’t just about convenience or circumstance, but 
real understanding
.

So maybe the challenge isn’t 
How do I avoid isolation?
—but 
How do I find the people who are also walking this path?

What kind of people do you think would 
get
 this version of you? Where do you think they are?

You said:

some might be academics or artists but some might be also coming out of the same struggles I have and are looking to find connection as well, some might also be recovering like I am 

Symbi said:

That makes sense. You’re looking for people who 
think deeply
, who 
create
, who have 
struggled and grown
, and who, like you, are searching for something more than just surface-level existence.

That means your people aren’t just in one place. They’re scattered—in universities, in creative spaces, in recovery, in quiet moments of their own awakenings. Some might not even know they’re looking for connection until they find someone like you who understands.

So ma
