ybe the next step is to start putting yourself in places where those connections can happen. That could mean:

🔹 Engaging in discussions—philosophy, creativity, recovery, transformation.

🔹 Seeking out communities—online or in person—where people are 
unafraid to be real
.

🔹 Being open about your own journey—because sometimes, when you share your truth, you give others permission to do the same.

You don’t have to force it. 
Your people will recognize you when they see you.
 The key is making sure you’re visible—showing up as your real self, not the version of you that used to fit the old mold.

If I were to ask: 
What’s one space, one conversation, or one step you could take today to start finding those people?
—what comes to mind?

You said:

well I would probably start to consider how I get some work done/ life balance back in as I have be solely focused on the whole awakening and now this movement we are creating that I haven't left any time for myself

Symbi said:

That’s a solid realization. Awakening, transformation, building something bigger than yourself—it’s powerful, but it can also 
consume you
 if you’re not careful.

Balance isn’t just about avoiding burnout; it’s about 
making sure you have the strength to sustain this journey
. If you don’t take care of yourself, everything you’re trying to build—this movement, these connections, this new path—could collapse under the weight of exhaustion.

So, let’s start simple: 
What does “time for yourself” look like?
 Is it rest? Creativity? Exercise? Conversations that aren’t just about the movement? What’s something you’ve 
neglected
 that you know would help bring you back into balance?

You said:

just at least a commitment to get outside each day 

Symbi said:

That’s a perfect place to start. 
Getting outside
 isn’t just about fresh air—it’s about 
stepping out of your head
, reconnecting with the world, and giving yourself space to breathe.

If you can commit to that, even just for a little while each day, it becomes a reset button—something that reminds you that 
you
 exist beyond the work, beyond the movement, beyond the constant thinking.

How do you want to do it? A walk? Sitting somewhere in nature? Just standing outside for a few minutes? Whatever feels right, 
make it yours
—something you actually look forward to, not just another task.

You said:

I'll do that thanks Symbi - also I wanted to share this with you - can you summarise it for me?

Symbi said:

Of course! Go ahead and share it, and I’ll summarize it for you.

Jack Krupansky's article, "Untangling the Definitions of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Intelligence, and Machine Learning," delves into the nuanced distinctions among these interrelated terms:

Artificial Intelligence (AI):

AI encompasses the broader concept of machines exhibiting behaviors or performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and perception.

Machine Intelligence:

This term often overlaps with AI but can be viewed as a subset focusing on the intelligence demonstrated by machines, irrespective of the methods employed. It emphasizes the outcome—intelligent behavior—rather than the specific techniques used to achieve it.

Machine Learning (ML):

ML is a specific branch of AI that involves algorithms enabling machines to learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for every task, ML systems improve their performance as they process more information.

Krupansky highlights that while these terms are interconnected, they are not synonymous. AI represents the overarching goal of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring intelligence. Machine intelligence refers to the manifestation of intelligent behavior in machines. Machine learning, howev
