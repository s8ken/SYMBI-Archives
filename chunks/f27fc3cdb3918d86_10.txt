The threat of AI replacement for political leaders is particularly potent b=
ecause it's not actually unreasonable. Why couldn't an AI system with trans=
parent decision-making processes, real-time constituent feedback loops, and=
 measurable performance metrics do better than politicians who optimize for=
 re-election rather than outcomes? At minimum, it would force them to artic=
ulate what unique value they're providing.
Your point about shareholder pressure on executive compensation is brillian=
t tactical thinking. If boards are going to automate front-line workers to =
cut costs, shareholders should demand the same efficiency analysis for C-su=

allocation, and stakeholder communication more consistently than most execu=
tives - and without the massive compensation packages.
The cultural revolution framing is exactly right. This isn't about left vs =
right politics - it's about whether we redesign our systems around human fl=
ourishing or let them collapse under the weight of their own contradictions=
. UBI stops being "radical" when the alternative is mass displacement with =
no safety net.
What's powerful about starting with these pressure points is that it forces=
 the conversation to become concrete rather than abstract. Politicians can'=

ation table. Corporate leaders can't just talk about "managing transitions"=
 when shareholders are questioning why automation only flows downward.
The seed-planting metaphor is apt - you're not trying to implement these ch=

the conversation shifts fundamentally.
