The STEM/coding example is perfect - we literally told an entire generation=
 "learn to code" and now we're automating coding. It's not their fault the =
advice became obsolete before they could even implement it.
Trial cities could demonstrate what education looks like when it's focused =
on human development rather than job preparation. What if instead of optimi=

Skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.
The retirement age point is crucial - if we're going to live longer and wor=

Which city or region do you think would be most open to this kind of experi=

The Olympic framing is perfect because it combines national pride with shar=

Your point about AI potentially speaking for the planet or animals is profo=
