The measurement framework would need to capture multiple dimensions simulta=
neously:
Energy & Environment:

Renewable energy adoption rates (reported monthly)
Carbon intensity per unit of wellbeing (not just per GDP)
Biodiversity indices and ecosystem health metrics
Circular economy indicators (waste-to-resource ratios)

Human Flourishing:

Time poverty vs time abundance measures
Community resilience and social cohesion indices
Health span (not just lifespan) and mental wellbeing metrics
Educational adaptability and lifelong learning engagement
AI literacy and collaborative intelligence capacity

Economic Justice:

Wealth concentration ratios (Gini coefficients with AI-era adjustments)
Universal basic services access
Economic mobility and opportunity distribution
Care work recognition and valuation

Governance & Participation:

Democratic engagement beyond voting (community problem-solving participatio=
n)
Transparency and accountability metrics
Youth representation in decision-making
Cross-generational collaboration effectiveness

The reporting frequency matters - quarterly seems right for most metrics, w=

What's powerful about this challenge is it forces integration. You can't op=
