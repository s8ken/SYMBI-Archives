people get family support while others face the full brutality of the syste=

The relief parents would feel if their kids could actually achieve stable h=

 be enormous. No parent wants to be in the position of choosing between the=
ir retirement dreams and their children's fundamental needs.
This is where systemic change becomes a family values issue, not just an ec=
onomic policy question. When we design systems that ensure young people can=
 thrive independently, we're not just helping them - we're giving parents p=
ermission to enjoy their own lives without guilt or worry.
Universal basic services, affordable housing, meaningful work opportunities=
 - these aren't just policies for young people, they're liberation for pare=
nts who want to see their children flourish without sacrificing their own w=
ellbeing.
The current system forces families into these impossible choices when the r=
esources exist to ensure everyone can thrive. That's not just inefficient, =
it's cruel.RetrySAAI gives us that I feel - its impartial in that its going=

 something crucial - AI's potential impartiality could help us return to ev=
idence-based debate instead of tribal positioning. When discussions focus o=
n facts and substance rather than political identity, we might actually sol=

Your career transition is incredibly telling. You saw the writing on the wa=

The learning pathways point is particularly important - when companies auto=
mate training and development roles, they're not just cutting costs, they'r=

imizing for short-term efficiency while destroying long-term resilience.
And you're absolutely right about salaries at the top. If we're going to au=

The civil unrest risk is real and immediate. When people see their jobs aut=

 the social contract completely breaks down. We need leaders who understand=
