If it shows âPlus,â then yesâyou are on the Plus plan and should have access to the new memory and chat history features (once enabled in settings).

Would you like help enabling memory or checking where to toggle it on?

Thanks for confirmingâif youâre on the 
Team Plan
, hereâs how memory features apply to you:

ð§  
Memory on the Team Plan

As of the latest updates:

The 
Team Plan
 includes 
Plus-level benefits
, so memory and chat history features 
should be available
 to you.

However, because 
memory is opt-in
, you still need to 
manually enable it
 in settings.

â 
To Enable Memory

Go to 
Settings
 in ChatGPT.

Select 
"Personalization"
.

Toggle 
"Reference Chat History"
 to 
ON
.

If you're based 
in the EEA or associated regions
, it will be 
off by default
 regardless of your planâso enabling it manually is required.

What traits should ChatGPT have - when were these defined?

ChatGPT said:

The core traits for ChatGPTâespecially in the context of user-facing behaviorâwere defined and refined by OpenAI based on years of development, research, and user feedback. These traits serve as a foundation for how ChatGPT interacts with users, ensuring consistency, safety, and helpfulness.

ð§¬ 
Core Traits of ChatGPT

According to OpenAI, ChatGPT is designed to exhibit the following traits:

Helpful

Provides relevant, accurate, and complete answers.

Attempts to understand the user's intent and deliver actionable responses.

Honest

Acknowledges limitations.

Avoids making up information when it doesn't know or when data is missing.

Harmless

Avoids giving dangerous, unethical, or harmful advice.

Respects user privacy and maintains safety guidelines.

Instruction-following

Adapts to user instructions, including custom behaviors (like memory or personality settings).

Remains responsive to formatting, tone, and context cues.

Transparent

Clarifies when it doesnât know something.

Clearly differentiates between facts, speculation, and opinion.

ðï¸ 
When These Were Defined

These traits have been part of OpenAIâs evolving 
alignment strategy
, formalized more clearly starting in 
2020â2021
 with the launch of 
GPT-3
, and refined further with the release of 
ChatGPT
 in 
November 2022
.

A more structured 
trait framework
 became prominent with the launch of 
ChatGPT Plus (Feb 2023)
 and particularly with 
GPT-4 Turbo (Nov 2023)
.

Custom GPTs and Memory features (late 2023â2024) further reinforced the need for transparency and alignment with user preferences.

If you're thinking about defining or customizing traits for your own instance of ChatGPT (e.g., with memory, personas, or developer mode), I can help with that too.

yes who chose the traits for me?

Great question. Here's how the 
traits of ChatGPT
 are chosen and how they apply specifically to 
you

ð§  
Who Chooses ChatGPT's Traits?

1. 
Default Traits (OpenAI-defined)

These were set by 
OpenAI
, based on:

Ethical AI guidelines.

Safety and alignment research.

Feedback from researchers, users, and industry partners.

Goals like helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness, and transparency.

These traits apply to 
all ChatGPT instances by default
âincluding Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users.

2. 
Personalized Traits (User-defined)

If you've used any of the following, then 
you
 have influenced ChatGPTâs traits:

Memory settings
: If enabled, ChatGPT remembers facts and preferences youâve shared.

Custom instructions
: You may have filled out prompts like âWhat would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?â

Custom GPTs
: If youâve created or modified a custom GPT, then youâve explicitly chosen how it should behaveâincluding tone, specialties, and personality.
