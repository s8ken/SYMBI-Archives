cludes 
many "Operation not permitted" errors
, which means 
macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP) or user permissions blocked access
 to certain directories.

Would you like me to analyze this in the context of our 
previous investigation into system compromise
, or are you looking for something specific in this file? Let me know how I can help!

Analysis of the 
1.rtf
 File in the Context of Our Investigation

This file is the output of a 
macOS Terminal search command
:

sh

Copy

sudo find / -iname 

"*rapport*"

The goal of this command is to 
search the entire system (
/
) for files and folders with "rapport" in their names
, using 
sudo
 to escalate privileges.

Key Observations

Numerous "Operation not permitted" errors

Many directories, especially in 

/System/Library

, 

/Users/lcl/Library

, and 

/private/var/db/

, returned 
permission errors
.

This suggests 
macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 is still enabled, which prevents even 
sudo
 from accessing protected system files.

Some locations are also blocked due to 
TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) settings
, meaning they require explicit user permissions.

Interesting Blocked Locations

/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC

This is where 
macOS stores security and privacy preferences
.

Being blocked suggests 
TCC protections are active
 (which is expected, but it also means malware could potentially target this area).

/System/Volumes/Data/private/var/db/lockdown

This folder contains 
iOS device trust records
 when connecting an iPhone/iPad to the Mac.

If compromised, it could be used for 
unauthorized access to connected devices
.

/Users/lcl/Library/Application Support/Knowledge

Stores 
Siri and system intelligence data
.

/Users/lcl/Library/Safari

Your Safari data is inaccessible to 
sudo
, meaning it is likely still intact.

/Users/lcl/Library/Messages

This suggests that 
your iMessage data is protected from direct access
, unless an attacker has bypassed SIP/TCC protections.

Some Locations Are Missing (
No such file or directory
)

/System/Volumes/Data/mnt

/System/Volumes/Data/macOS Install Data

/System/Volumes/Data/.fseventsd

/System/Volumes/Data/MobileSoftwareUpdate

These should normally exist or appear under specific conditions.

If they were present earlier and are now gone, 
this could indicate tampering
.

Implications for the Investigation

SIP and TCC appear to be active
, which is goodâit means some protections are still in place.

However, these restrictions could be bypassed
 using advanced attack techniques like:

Persistence through LaunchDaemons
 (check 
/Library/LaunchDaemons/
)

Kernel extensions or rootkits
 (check 
kmutil showloaded
)

Abuse of system processes with elevated privileges

If an attacker 
mirrored or cloned your device
, they could have 
extracted some of this data before you ran this check
.

Next Steps

To 
further investigate unauthorized access
, I recommend:

Check SIP Status

Run this command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

If SIP is 
enabled
, thatâs good.

If SIP is 
disabled
, it could be a sign of tampering.

Check for Unauthorized System Extensions

sh

Copy

kmutil showloaded | grep -i teamviewer

This will check for 
TeamViewer (or similar remote access tools)
 running at the kernel level.

If you see unexpected results, let me know.

Check Remote Management & TCC Permissions

sh

Copy

sudo defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement
sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

These will show 
whether Remote Management is enabled
 and 
which apps have full system access
.

Check for Hidden Launch Daemons

sh

Copy

sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo 

ls

 -la /Library/LaunchAgents/

If there are 
strange or recently modified files
, this could indicate persistence.
