tem Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing us from modifying them
.

ð Next Steps: Attempt to Disable 
rapportd
 Without Disabling SIP

We will now 
try to stop 
rapportd
 without disabling SIP
.

1ï¸â£ Stop 
rapportd
 Manually

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop com.apple.rapportd

2ï¸â£ Unload 
rapportd
 From Memory

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

â 
If this works, 
rapportd
 should no longer restart.

ð ï¸ If 
rapportd
 Still Runs After Restart

If 
rapportd

comes back after reboot
, we will need to 
temporarily disable SIP
 to delete the 
.plist
 files completely.

Would you like me to guide you through 
temporarily disabling SIP
, or do you want to wait and see if these steps work first? ð

launchctl bootout

confirms that 
macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP) is preventing 
rapportd
 from being stopped or removed
.

At this point, 
the only way to permanently remove 
rapportd
 is to temporarily disable SIP
.

ð Next Steps: Temporarily Disable SIP to Fully Remove 
rapportd

Since SIP is enforcing protection, we need to 
disable it in Recovery Mode
 to remove the 
rapportd
 files.

1ï¸â£ Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

Restart your Mac
 and immediately press and hold 
Command (â) + R
.

Keep holding until you see the 
Apple logo or a spinning globe
.

Once in 
macOS Utilities
, click 
Utilities
 in the menu bar and select 
Terminal
.

2ï¸â£ Disable SIP

In 
macOS Recovery Mode Terminal
, type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

disable

Press 
Enter
, then restart your Mac normally.

3ï¸â£ Remove 
rapportd
 Launch Files

Once back in normal macOS, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.rapportd
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist

â 
This completely removes 
rapportd
.

4ï¸â£ Re-enable SIP for Security

After removing 
rapportd
, we need to turn SIP 
back on
.

Restart your Mac and 
go back into macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
).

Open 
Terminal
 in Recovery Mode.

Type:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

Restart your Mac normally.

5ï¸â£ Final Check

Once back in macOS, confirm 
rapportd
 is gone:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i rapportd
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

â 
If 
rapportd
 is no longer running and port 49153 is closed, your Mac is fully locked down!
