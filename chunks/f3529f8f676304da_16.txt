f a hidden 
mobile device management (MDM) profile
 or enterprise configuration is present, it could be 
re-enabling protections
.

ð Next Steps: Let's Try Another Approach

Since macOS 
is still preventing modification
, letâs check for 
hidden protections
 before taking drastic action.

1ï¸â£ Check If System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Actually Off

Even if you ran 
csrutil disable
, 
letâs double-check
:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

â If it says 
"System Integrity Protection: disabled"
, then SIP is off.

â If it says 
"enabled"
, then SIP was re-enabled somehow.

2ï¸â£ Check for FileVault Encryption

If your disk is encrypted, macOS might 
block modifications
:

sh

Copy

fdesetup status

â If it says 
"FileVault is Off"
, then itâs not encrypting your disk.

â If it says 
"On"
, then 
you may need to disable FileVault temporarily
 before modifications.

3ï¸â£ Check for Hidden Configuration Profiles (MDM)

If a 
mobile device management (MDM) profile
 is installed, it could be 
forcing system security settings back on
.

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

â 
If no profiles are found
, this is not the issue.

â 
If profiles appear
, send me the output so we can investigate further.

4ï¸â£ Attempt to Modify a Different System File

Instead of directly targeting 
rapportd
, 
letâs check if anything in the system folder is writable
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

touch

 /System/testfile.txt

â 
If this works
, the filesystem 
can be modified
, and the issue may be related to 
rapportd
 itself.

â 
If it fails
, the entire filesystem is still protected.

ð Try These Steps and Let Me Know the Results

This will 
help us determine why your Mac is still protecting system files
 even after disabling SIP. ð

SIP is Confirmed Disabled

Since 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is off
, macOS 
should allow system modifications
, but something is still blocking it.

ð Next Steps: Check for Other Security Mechanisms

Letâs systematically find out whatâs preventing modifications.

1ï¸â£ Check If FileVault Encryption is Active

If FileVault is enabled, the disk is 
still protected
, even with SIP off.

sh

Copy

fdesetup status

â 
If it says "FileVault is Off," encryption is not an issue.

â 
If it says "On," we may need to disable FileVault temporarily.

2ï¸â£ Check for Hidden MDM or Configuration Profiles

If a 
mobile device management (MDM) profile
 is present, it may be 
forcing security settings
 back on.

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

â 
If no profiles appear, this is not an issue.

â 
If profiles are found, send me the output so we can investigate.

3ï¸â£ Check If the System Drive is Read-Only

Even with SIP disabled, macOS 
still treats the root filesystem as read-only
. Letâs check:

sh

Copy

mount

ð Look for a line like:

pgsql

Copy

/dev/disk1s5 

on

 / (apfs, sealed, 

read

-

only

, 

local

, journaled)

â 
If "read-only" is still present, that explains why we cannot modify 
rapportd
.

â 
If "read-only" is NOT there, we should be able to modify system files.

4ï¸â£ Attempt to Modify Any System File

Try creating a test file in the system directory:

sh

Copy

sudo 

touch

 /System/testfile.txt

â 
If this works
, your system 
is writable
, and the issue is specific to 
rapportd
.

â 
If this fails
, macOS is still enforcing a 
read-only system state
.

ð 
Run these checks and let me know what you find!

Once we understand 
why macOS is blocking system modifications
, we can bypass it. ð
