Good News:
 There are 
no MDM profiles
, meaning your system isnât being controlled remotely.

â 
Problem:
 Your root filesystem 
is still sealed and read-only
, which is preventing modifications.

ð Next Steps: Fully Unlock the System Volume

Even though 
SIP is disabled
, macOS 
still protects the root filesystem
 as read-only unless we 
explicitly disable the Sealed System Volume (SSV).

1ï¸â£ Disable Authenticated Root Volume (SSV)

Since 
csrutil authenticated-root disable

didnât work before
, we will force macOS to treat the root partition as writable.

Reboot into macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
 on startup).

Open 
Terminal
 in Recovery Mode.

Run:

sh

Copy

csrutil authenticated-root 

disable

Restart your Mac normally
.

2ï¸â£ Remount the Root Filesystem as Writable

Once macOS boots back up, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo mount -uw /

â If this works, the root filesystem will now be writable.

3ï¸â£ Verify That the System is Writable

To check if the root partition is now writable, try:

sh

Copy

sudo 

touch

 /System/testfile.txt

â 
If this works
, we are ready to delete 
rapportd
.

â 
If it still says "Read-Only," let me know and weâll try another method.

4ï¸â£ Remove 
rapportd
 Permanently

Once the system is writable, run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

â This 
removes 
rapportd
 permanently
.

5ï¸â£ Re-enable SIP & SSV for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is gone, restart into 
macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
) and run:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

â This 
locks your system back down
 while keeping 
rapportd
 removed.

ð Try These Steps and Let Me Know the Results!
 ð

If 
mount -uw /

still fails after these steps
, we will look at 
manually creating a writable snapshot to override the system protection.

ð¨ Root Filesystem Still Read-Only (Even After SSV Disabled)

The fact that 
mount -uw /

still fails
 after disabling 
SIP and SSV
 suggests that macOS 
is enforcing additional protections
 on your system.

ð Next Steps: Work Around Apple's Restrictions

Since Apple prevents direct modification of the 
sealed system volume
, we will 
create a writable snapshot
, make changes there, and reboot into it.

1ï¸â£ Create a Writable Snapshot of the System Volume

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

cp

 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist ~/Desktop/
sudo 

cp

 /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist ~/Desktop/
sudo 

cp

 /usr/libexec/rapportd ~/Desktop/
sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs /System/Volumes/Data /mnt
sudo bless --mount /mnt --setBoot
sudo reboot

â 
What This Does:

Copies 
rapportd
 files 
to your Desktop
 (backup in case needed).

Mounts the 
writable Data volume
 to 
/mnt
.

Sets the boot volume to 
/mnt
 (writa
