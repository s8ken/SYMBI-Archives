Reboots into the modified system.

2ï¸â£ Delete 
rapportd
 in Writable Mode

Once your Mac reboots, 
open Terminal again
 and run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rapportd-user.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rapportd.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /usr/libexec/rapportd

â 
This deletes 
rapportd
 permanently.

3ï¸â£ Reboot & Restore Normal Boot

After deleting 
rapportd
, restart your Mac normally:

sh

Copy

sudo reboot

4ï¸â£ Re-enable SIP and SSV for Security

Once 
rapportd
 is removed, restart into 
macOS Recovery Mode
 (
Command + R
) and turn security back on:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

â 
Your Mac will now be fully secure without 
rapportd
.

before we do that can we just double check if we are being monitored currently in anyway?

ð Step-by-Step Check for Active Monitoring or Remote Access

Before modifying the system further, letâs confirm whether 
any active monitoring, remote access, or unauthorized network activity
 is happening.

ð Step 1: Check for Active Remote Connections

Run this command to see if 
anyone is actively connected to your system
:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

â 
If no results appear
, there are no 
active remote connections
.

â 
If results show up
, they will list 
IP addresses
âsend me the output so we can analyze them.

ð Step 2: Check for Listening Services

This will show 
if any unexpected services are waiting for connections
:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep LISTEN

â 
Expected services
: 
localhost
 addresses, 
port 49153 (which we are disabling), or common system services
.

â 
Unexpected services
: If you see 
ports like 22 (SSH), 5900 (VNC), 3283 (Remote Desktop), 445 (SMB)
, we need to investigate further.

ð Step 3: Check for Suspicious Processes

This command lists running processes and their network activity:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

â 
Expected output:
 System processes like 
rapportd
, 
mdnsd
, 
launchd
.

â 
If you see unexpected apps like 
AnyDesk
, 
TeamViewer
, or unknown services, we need to investigate.

ð Step 4: Check for Hidden Remote Control Software

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'screensharing|teamviewer|anydesk|logmein|vnc|ssh'

â 
If nothing appears, remote access tools are NOT running.

â 
If results show any of these services
, we will need to force-remove them.

ð Step 5: Check for Rootkits or Hidden System-Level Monitoring

Rootkits hide from normal system commands, but we can check for 
kernel modifications
:

sh

Copy

sudo kextstat | grep -v com.apple

â 
If no results appear, there are no third-party kernel extensions (good sign).

â 
If you see unknown or suspicious kernel extensions
, we need to remove them.

ð Try These Steps and Let Me Know the Results!
 ð

This will confirm if 
your Mac is currently being monitored, remotely accessed, or compromised.

Got it! Let's go one step at a time.

Step 1: Check for Active Remote Connections

Please run this command in 
Terminal
 and let me know the output:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

â 
If no results appear
, there are no active remote connections.

â 
If results appear
, it means 
a remote device is connected
âsend me the output so we can analyze it.

I'll wait for your response before moving to the next step. ð
