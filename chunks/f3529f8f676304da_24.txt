ð Summary: Are These Suspicious?

Apple (â Safe)
 â The 
Apple connections
 are normal and expected.

Fastly, Akamai, Cloudflare (â Usually Safe)
 â These are 
CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)
 that speed up web browsing and apps.

Proton AG (â ï¸ Needs Verification)
 â If 
you use ProtonMail or ProtonVPN
, this is fine.

If you donât use Proton services
, this could be an issue.

Amazon AWS (â ï¸ Needs Verification)
 â This depends on 
which app is using it
. Many companies use AWS, but 
some attackers also host services on AWS
.

ð Next Step: Find Out Which Apps Are Making These Connections

Run this command to 
see which process is connecting to these IPs
:

sh

Copy

sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
This will show which apps or services are using these remote connections.

â 
If you recognize them (Safari, Mail, etc.), they are fine.

â 
If you see unknown apps, we need to investigate further.

Let me know what the output shows! ð
