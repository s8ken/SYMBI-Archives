ð¨ Some Remote Management Services Are Still Running

Even after disabling them, 

remotemanagementd
 and 
ScreenSharingSubscriber
 are still active
, meaning they 
may have been automatically restarted
 by macOS.

ð Next Step: Force Stop and Unload These Services

Letâs manually 
force stop them
 and 
prevent them from restarting
.

Run the following 
one by one
 in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remotemanagementd.plist

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.ScreenSharingSubscriber
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ScreenSharingSubscriber.plist

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl stop system/com.apple.remoted
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.remoted.plist

ð ï¸ After Running These, Verify Again

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote

â If 
nothing appears
, the services are fully stopped.

â If 
they are still running
, macOS 
is forcing them to restart
, and we will take a stronger approach.

ð 
Run the commands and send me the results!

launchctl bootout

 Even though we disabled SIP, some protections rema
