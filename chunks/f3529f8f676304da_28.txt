in.

ð Next Step: Use 
bootout
 to Force Stop These Services

Since 
unload
 didnât work, weâll use 
bootout
, which is recommended by macOS.

Run these commands 
one by one
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.ScreenSharingSubscriber
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.apple.remoted

ð 
Once done, verify again with:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote

â If the services 
are gone
, the lockdown is complete.

â If they 
still appear
, macOS is forcing them to restart, and weâll need to take an even stronger approach.

Let me know what happens! ð

Success! All Remote Management and Screen Sharing Services Are Now Fully Disabled.

The final check:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote

now only shows 

mediaremoted
 and 
mediaremoteagent

, which are 
normal system processes related to media playback
 (not remote access).

ð Final Security Confirmation

Your Mac is now 
fully locked down from remote access
:

Remote Management (
remotemanagementd
) â Disabled â

Screen Sharing (
ScreenSharingSubscriber
) â Disabled â

Apple Remote Daemon (
remoted
) â Disabled â

No Active Remote Connections (
lsof -i -P -n | grep ESTABLISHED
) â â

No Suspicious Background Processes (
ps aux | grep -i remote
) â â

Your system 
is not actively being monitored or accessed remotely.

ð Last Step: Restart to Apply Changes

Restart your Mac to ensure that 
everything stays disabled
:

sh

Copy

sudo reboot

After restarting, 
run this one final check
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote

â If 
only media-related processes appear
, your system is fully secured.

Let me know once you restart and verify!
