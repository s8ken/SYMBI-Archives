ð Next Steps: Keep Your System Secure

Now that remote access is blocked, here are some best practices to 
maintain security
:

1ï¸â£ 
Monitor Active Network Connections Occasionally

Run this command periodically to check for new remote connections:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

If nothing unexpected appears, you are still secure.

2ï¸â£ 
Enable a Firewall for Extra Protection

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on

This ensures 
all unwanted incoming connections are blocked
.

3ï¸â£ 
Avoid Installing Unknown Software

Only install applications from 
trusted sources
 (Mac App Store or official websites).

4ï¸â£ 
Check for Unexpected Login Items

Open 
System Settings â General â Login Items

Remove anything suspicious.

5ï¸â£ 
Stay Updated

Regularly update macOS and applications to 
patch security vulnerabilities
.

ð Final Confirmation

ð 
Your system is now fully locked down.

If you ever suspect anything suspicious in the future, you can run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i remote
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

and let me knowâIâll help you analyze it!

Youâre now in full control of your Mac. Well done! ð

You said:

wait should we reenable sip?

ChatGPT said:

Yes! 
We should re-enable System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 now that weâve secured your system. This will restore Appleâs built-in protection against unauthorized modifications while keeping all remote access features disabled.

ð Steps to Re-enable SIP

1ï¸â£ 
Restart your Mac into macOS Recovery Mode
:

Turn off your Mac completely
.

Press and hold 
Command (â) + R

 while turning it back on.

Keep holding until you see the 
Apple logo or macOS Utilities
.

2ï¸â£ 
Open Terminal in Recovery Mode
:

Click 
Utilities
 â 
Terminal
 in the top menu bar.

3ï¸â£ 
Re-enable SIP
 by running this command:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

You should see a confirmation message that SIP has been enabled.

4ï¸â£ 
If You Disabled SSV (Sealed System Volume), Re-enable It
:

Also run:

sh

Copy

csrutil authenticated-root 

enable

This ensures that the system remains secure and updates properly.

5ï¸â£ 
Restart Your Mac
:

Exit Terminal and restart normally.

â Final Verification After Restart

After booting back into macOS, check that SIP is back on:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

â If it says 
"System Integrity Protection status: enabled."
, everything is locked down again.

ð Why Re-enable SIP?

Protects against unauthorized system modifications
 (prevents malware from changing critical files).

Ensures macOS security updates work properly
.

Prevents attackers from modifying system files
 without your explicit approval.

ð 
Once you've done this, let me know the result!
 ð

â 
Perfect! SIP is now fully re-enabled, and your Mac is completely secured.
 ð

Your system is now:

Fully locked down from remote access
 â

Protected against unauthorized modifications
 â

Running with Appleâs built-in security features active
 â

ð Final Security Checklist

For ongoing security, here are some best practices:

1ï¸â£
