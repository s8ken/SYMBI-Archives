pps have full access to your system via TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) settings
.

Command 2: List Apps with Full System Access

Run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

ð 
This will list all apps that have requested special permissions
 (e.g., Full Disk Access, Screen Recording, Accessibility, etc.).

After you run this, let me know:

Do you see any unexpected apps with access?

Any apps you donât recognize?

If the list is long, we can filter specific permissions like Screen Recording or Full Disk Access in the next step.

Step 4 Update: Authorization Denied Error

The error:

pgsql

Copy

Error: unable 

to

open

database

 "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db": 

authorization

 denied

means that 
macOS is blocking access to the TCC database
, even with 
sudo
. This is expected behavior under 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
.

Alternative: Access TCC Database Using Full Disk Access

To bypass this restriction, we need to 
grant Terminal "Full Disk Access"
 in macOS settings.

Steps to Allow Terminal to Read TCC Database

Open System Settings
:

Click the 
Apple menu
 (ï£¿) â 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll down to "Full Disk Access"
.

Find and add Terminal
:

Click 
"+"
 (plus button).

Select 
Terminal
 from the Applications list.

Turn the toggle ON
.

Restart Terminal
 for the changes to take effect.

Re-run the TCC Database Command

Now, try the command again:

sh

Copy

sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 

'SELECT * FROM access'

ð 
Let me know if it works! If itâs too long, we can filter for only critical permissions.

Step 4 Analysis: Reviewing Apps with Full System Access

Your TCC database output shows 
which apps have Full Disk Access
 (meaning they can read, modify, or delete any file on your system).

Detected Apps with Full System Access:

Disk Drill (
com.cleverfiles.DiskDrill
)

â 
Legitimate app
, used for 
data recovery and disk management
.

ð´ 
Risk:
 If an attacker used it, they could access deleted files or sensitive data.

Did you install Disk Drill, or was it installed without your knowledge?

cfbackd
 (related to Disk Drill)

â 
Background process for Disk Drillâs recovery features.

ð´ 
Potential risk if an attacker manipulated it to exfiltrate files.

Terminal (
com.apple.Terminal
)

â 
Expected
 since we just added Full Disk Access for Terminal.

No concerns here.

Next Steps: Remove Disk Drill if Unwanted

If 
you did not install Disk Drill
, it could have been installed as part of an attack to 
monitor, recover, or extract deleted data
.

How to Remove Disk Drill Completely

Uninstall using Terminal (safer than dragging to Trash)

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Disk\ Drill.app
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/DiskDrill
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.cleverfiles.DiskDrill.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.cleverfiles.Di
