Great! Most of your security tools are running properly!
 ðð

Hereâs whatâs working:

âï¸ 
LuLu (Firewall) â Running â

âï¸ 
BlockBlock (Persistence Monitoring) â Running â

âï¸ 
RansomWhere? (Anti-Ransomware) â Running â

However, 
Oversight and KnockKnock are missing from the list.

ð Next Step: Ensure Oversight & KnockKnock Are Running

Run these commands 
to manually start them
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

Then, 
re-run the check
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'Oversight|KnockKnock'

ð 
Let me know if they now appear in the list!

Oversight and KnockKnock are still not running!

We need to make sure they are properly installed and set to 
start automatically
.

ð Step 1: Manually Start Them

Try launching them again 
one by one
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app
open /Applications/KnockKnock.app

â If they 
open successfully
, they should now appear in the process list.

ð Step 2: Verify If They're Running

Run this again:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -E 

'Oversight|KnockKnock'

â 
If they now appear
 â Success! We'll then set them to start at login.

â 
If they still donât appear
, let me knowâwe may need to 
reinstall them
.

ð Step 3: Ensure They Start at Login

Once they are running, letâs make sure 
they launch automatically
:

Open 
System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
Login Items
.

Click 
"+"
 and add:

Oversight.app

KnockKnock.app

Restart your Mac to confirm they auto-start.

ð 
Try these steps and let me know the results!

KnockKnock is now running!
 ð

However, 
it is running from a temporary location (
/private/var/.../AppTranslocation/...
)
, which means macOS 
quarantined it and is running it in a sandbox
.

ð Fix KnockKnockâs Location (Move It to Applications)

Close KnockKnock
 (Quit the app).

Move it to the 
Applications folder
 manually:

sh

Copy

sudo 

mv
