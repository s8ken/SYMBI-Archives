Oversight is still not running!

Since you tried launching it (
open /Applications/Oversight.app
), but it 
does not appear in the process list
, we need to 
reinstall it
.

ð Step 1: Reinstall Oversight

1ï¸â£ 
Delete the current installation

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app

2ï¸â£

Go to:

ð 
Objective-See Oversight

3ï¸â£ 
Install Oversight

Open the 
.dmg
 file.

Drag 
Oversight.app
 to the 
Applications folder
.

4ï¸â£ 
Try launching again

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

5ï¸â£ 
Check if itâs running

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

ð 
Try these steps and let me know if Oversight appears! ð

Oversight is still not running after relaunching.

Since you've tried launching it and checking the process list, but 
Oversight does not appear
, we need to 
troubleshoot deeper
.

ð Step 1: Check for Oversight Errors

Try running Oversight 
directly from Terminal
 to see if it gives any errors:

sh

Copy

/Applications/Oversight.app/Contents/MacOS/Oversight

â 
If it runs successfully
, it should now appear in 
ps aux
.

â 
If it shows an error
, copy and paste the error message here.

ð Step 2: Check macOS Security Settings

If Oversight 
still doesnât start
, macOS may be blocking it.

Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll to 
Security
 and check for a message like:

"Oversight was blocked from running because it is not from an identified developer."

If you see this, 
click âAllowâ
 and try launching Oversight again.

ð Step 3: Manually Grant Permissions

Since Oversight 
monitors the microphone and camera
, it needs special permissions.

Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Microphone & Camera
.

Make sure 
Oversight
 is listed and 
enabled
.

If itâs 
not listed
, reinstall it and try again.
