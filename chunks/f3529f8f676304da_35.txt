 likely need to configure Oversight before it runs properly.
 Letâs set it up step by step.

ð Step 1: Manually Launch the Configuration

Since Oversight runs in the background, it may need to be manually set up.

1ï¸â£ Open Oversightâs settings manually:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

2ï¸â£ If a window pops up asking for permissions, 
follow the setup steps
.

ð Step 2: Grant Necessary Permissions

Since Oversight 
monitors the microphone and camera
, macOS may be blocking it.

Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll to 
Microphone
 and 
Camera
.

Ensure 
Oversight
 is listed and 
enabled
.

If Oversight is 
not listed
, we need to reinstall and run it manually.

ð Step 3: Check If It's Running

Once you've configured it, check if itâs running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

â 
If it appears, youâre good to go!

â 
If not, let me know whatâs happeningâany errors or missing options?

not listed - need to reinstall

â 
Reinstalling Oversight is the best next step!
 Let's do it carefully to make sure it installs properly and gets the necessary permissions.

ð Step 1: Fully Remove Oversight

First, delete any old files to avoid conflicts:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app

Then, check for any leftover files:

sh

Copy

sudo find /Library /Users -name 

"*Oversight*"

 -

exec

rm

 -rf {} +

This removes any old config files that might be interfering.

ð Step 2: Download a Fresh Copy

Go to
 ð 
Objective-See Oversight

Download the 
.dmg
 file.

Open the 
.dmg
 file and drag 
Oversight.app
 to Applications.

ð Step 3: Manually Open & Configure Oversight

Now, launch Oversight manually so macOS recognizes it:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

If a 
security prompt appears
, click 
Allow
.

If macOS blocks it, 
go to
:

System Settings â Privacy & Security
 â Scroll down to "Allow apps downloaded from" â Click 
"Allow"
 for Oversight.

ð Step 4: Grant Permissions

Once Oversight opens, manually 
grant it permission
:

Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
.

Click 
Microphone
 â Ensure Oversight is 
enabled
.

Click 
Camera
 â Ensure Oversight is 
enabled
.

Click 
Full Disk Access
 â 
Add Oversight
 if it's not listed.

ð Step 5: Verify That It's Running

Once permissions are granted, check if itâs running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

â 
If Oversight appears in the list, it's working!
 ð

â 
If not, let me know where you get stuck!

terminal is asking to access data from other apps

ChatGPT said:

ð¨ 
macOS is asking Terminal for access to other app data because you ran 
sudo find /Library /Users -name "*Oversight*"

. This is normal since we were searching for leftover files.

ð What to Do Now?

1ï¸â£ If prompted, 
click "Deny"
 â We donât need Terminal to access other app data.

2ï¸â£ Instead, we will 
manually check for leftover files
:

Run:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/Objective-See

If you see a folder named 
Oversight
, delete it:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Objective-See/Oversight

ð Continue with Reinstall

Now, follow these steps to reinstall:

Go to
: 
Objective-See Oversight

Download and 
install
 Oversight.

Manually launch it
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

Grant permissions
 (Privacy & Security â Microphone & Camera).

Check if it's running
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

ð 
Try this and let me know if Oversight finally runs!
