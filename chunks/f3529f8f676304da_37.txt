You're seeing "Operation not permitted" errors because macOS is blocking access to certain system and user files due to privacy settings.
 This is expected behavior when running 
find
 without full disk access.

ð Step 1: Enable Full Disk Access for Terminal

To allow Terminal to remove all Oversight-related files, we need to grant it 
Full Disk Access
.

1ï¸â£ Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Full Disk Access
.

2ï¸â£ Find and 
enable Full Disk Access for Terminal
.

If Terminal isnât listed, 
click the 
+
 button, add it from 
/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app
, and enable it
.

3ï¸â£ Close 
System Settings
 and restart Terminal.

Now, 
rerun the cleanup command
:

sh

Copy

sudo find /Library /Users -name 

"*Oversight*"

 -

exec

rm

 -rf {} +

â This should now delete any remaining Oversight files.

ð Step 2: Reinstall Oversight

Download a fresh copy
 from 

Objective-See Oversight

.

Open the 
.dmg
 file and 
drag 
Oversight.app
 to Applications
.

Run:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

If it 
doesnât launch
, go to 
System Settings â Privacy & Security
 and allow it under 
"Allow apps downloaded from"
.

ð Step 3: Verify Oversight is Running

After launching, check if it's running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

â 
If it appears, itâs now running successfully!

ð 
Try these steps and let me know the result!

Perfect! The "Operation not permitted" messages are now minimal, meaning you successfully removed most of Oversight's files.

ð Step 1: Final Oversight Reinstallation

Now, letâs do a 
clean install
:

1ï¸â£ 
Download a fresh copy
:

ð 
Objective-See Oversight

2ï¸â£ 
Install it properly
:

Open the 
.dmg
 file.

Drag 
Oversight.app
 into the Applications folder
.

If it asks to replace an old version, confirm 
Replace
.

3ï¸â£ 
Launch Oversight manually
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

4ï¸â£ 
Check if it's running
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

ð Step 2: Grant Permissions

If Oversight 
still doesnât run
, macOS may be blocking it. Try this:

Go to
: 
System Settings â Privacy & Security
.

Scroll down to
: 
"Allow apps down
