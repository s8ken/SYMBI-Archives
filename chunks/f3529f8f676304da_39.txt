Oversight is missing from the list!

All other security tools (
LuLu, BlockBlock, KnockKnock, and RansomWhere?
) 
are running correctly
, but 
Oversight is not active
.

ð Step 1: Manually Start Oversight

Try launching it again:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

Then, check if it's running:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

â 
If it now appears in the list, itâs working!
 ð

ð Step 2: Check If Itâs Crashing

If Oversight 
still doesnât show up
, letâs check for errors:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS "Oversight"'

 --info --last 10m

â If you see error messages, copy and paste them here so we can troubleshoot further.

ð Step 3: Ensure Oversight Starts at Login

Open 
System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
Login Items
.

Click 
"+"
 and add 
Oversight.app
.

Restart your Mac and check if Oversight starts automatically.

ð 
Try these steps and let me know if Oversight is running!

Oversight is still not running.
 Let's do a final deep troubleshooting to get it working.

ð Step 1: Try Running Oversight from Terminal Directly

Since launching it normally isnât working, letâs run it 
directly from the command line
 to check for errors:

sh

Copy

/Applications/Oversight.app/Contents/MacOS/Oversight

â If it runs successfully, it should now appear in 
ps aux
.

â 
If it gives an error, copy and paste the error message here.
 This will help us troubleshoot further.

ð Step 2: Check macOS Security Settings

Mac might be blocking Oversight. To fix this:

1ï¸â£ Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
.

2ï¸â£ Scroll down to 
Security
 â Look for a message saying:

"Oversight was blocked from running because it is not from an identified developer."

If you see this, click 
"Allow Anyway"
.

3ï¸â£ Open 
System Settings
 â 
Privacy & Security
 â 
Microphone & Camera
.

Make sure Oversight is listed and enabled.

ð Step 3: Check for Crash Logs

If Oversight still doesnât start, let's check if itâs crashing:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS "Oversight"'

 --info --last 10m

â 
If it shows errors, paste them here so I can analyze.

ð Step 4: Reinstall Oversight One More Time (If Still Failing)

If 
Steps 1-3 donât work
, letâs 
fully remove and reinstall it
:

1ï¸â£ 
Delete the current version
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app

2ï¸â£ 
Download a fresh copy
:

ð 
Objective-See Oversight

3ï¸â£ 
Install & Launch
:

Open the 
.dmg
 file and 
drag Oversight into Applications
.

Run:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

4ï¸â£ 
Check again
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

ð 
Try these steps and let me know what happens! If there's an error, send me the output so I can troubleshoot further.

hmmm its strange you say its not running because when I start Photo Booth or start a QuickTime recording it is warning me about the camera and mic

ChatGPT said:

â 
Great news! If Oversight is warning you when the camera or microphone is activated, then it is actually running!
 ð

The reason 
it's not appearing in 
ps aux

 could be because 
it runs as a background agent rather than a visible process.
 Some macOS security tools donât always show up in a simple 
ps aux
 command.
