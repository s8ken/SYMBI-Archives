ok great so what I want to be able to make sure of is that they cannot start remote management for any reason, there is no possibility of connecting to any network drives, airplay cannot be accessed without my permission

Step 5: Locking Down Remote Access, Network Drives, and AirPlay

Since 
Remote Management is NOT enabled
, we will now 
harden your Mac
 to ensure no one can 
enable it, connect remotely, or access your devices without permission
.

ð 1. Block Remote Management Permanently

Even though itâs currently disabled, letâs 
completely lock it down
.

Disable Remote Management & Remove Any Hidden Services

Run these commands in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.screensharing
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.RemoteDesktop
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /var/db/RemoteManagement

â 
What This Does:

Disables Remote Login (SSH)

Disables macOS Screen Sharing

Disables Apple Remote Desktop

Deletes remote management settings

ð 
Let me know once youâve run this!

ð 2. Block Network Drive Access (SMB, AFP, and NFS)

This prevents 
unauthorized access to shared folders or network drives
.

Disable File Sharing & Network Services

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.smbd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AFPServer
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.nfsd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.filesharingd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.NetworkBrowserAgent
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleFileServer.plist
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.smb.server.plist

â 
What This Does:

Disables SMB, AFP, and NFS (file-sharing protocols)

Prevents macOS from automatically connecting to network drives

Stops macOS from auto-browsing shared devices

ð 
Let me know once you've run this!

ð 3. Lock Down AirPlay & Prevent Unauthorized Access

Check AirPlay Settings

Manually check:

Go to System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
AirDrop & Handoff
.

Turn off "Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices"
.

Go to System Settings
 â 
Displays
 â 
AirPlay Receiver
.

Set 
AirPlay to OFF
 or 
Allow only to "This Mac only"
.

Completely Disable AirPlay in Terminal

Run:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.airplay
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay allowAirPlay -bool 

false

â 
What This Does:

Prevents AirPlay from starting

Stops attackers from mirroring your screen

Blocks unauthorized AirPlay device connections

ð 
Let me know once you've done this!

ð 4. Disable Bluetooth Auto-Connections (Prevent Hidden Devices)

Attackers can use 
Bluetooth connections to exploit macOS and access your system
.

Turn Off Bluetooth Auto-Pairing

sh

Copy

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 0
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.bluetoothd

â 
This stops Bluetooth from automatically pairing devices
 without permission.

ð 
Let me know once you've done this!

ð 5. Check and Disable Any Unwanted Sharing Settings

Run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo launchctl lis
