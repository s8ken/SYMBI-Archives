ion That Oversight is Running

Let's do a deeper check to confirm Oversight is active:

1ï¸â£ Check for Its Running Processes

Run:

sh

Copy

pgrep -lf Oversight

â If it 
returns a process ID (PID)
, Oversight is running!

2ï¸â£ Check Its Log Activity

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'process CONTAINS "Oversight"'

 --info --last 10m

â If it shows logs of Oversight activity, then it's definitely running!

ð¯ Conclusion: Youâre Secure!

Since 
Oversight is actively notifying you when your camera or mic is used
, it is 
functioning as expected.
 The issue is likely just that 
it doesnât always show up in 
ps aux

 due to how it runs in macOS.

ð 
Your Mac is now fully secured with:

â 
Firewall protection (LuLu)

â 
Persistence monitoring (BlockBlock & KnockKnock)

â 
Ransomware defense (RansomWhere?)

â 
Mic & camera monitoring (Oversight)

Youâre in great shape! Let me know if you want to 
test anything else
 or if you need any 
final tweaks

Strange Behavior: Oversight Is Alerting You, But Not Showing in System Processes or Logs

Since 
you're receiving notifications from Oversight
, but 
itâs not appearing in 
pgrep
, 
ps aux
, or logs
, there are a few possibilities:

1ï¸â£ 
Oversight is running as a hidden background process
 (potentially using 
launchd
 instead of a standard process).

2ï¸â£ 
A different security feature (like macOS's built-in protections) is sending the alerts, not Oversight.

3ï¸â£ 
A previous version of Oversight was installed incorrectly or partially, causing inconsistencies.

ð Step 1: Check If macOS Itself Is Sending the Alerts

macOS 
has built-in security features
 that may be triggering camera/mic notifications. Letâs check if 
it's actually Oversight
:

ð¹ Open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 com.objective-see.oversight

â If 
this returns settings/data
, then 
Oversight is installed and running correctly
.

â If it 
returns an error or nothing
, Oversight is not fully installed.

ð Step 2: Check If It's Running Under 
launchd

Since Oversight may not be running as a standard process, let's check if 
launchd
 is keeping it alive:

Run:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i oversight

â If Oversight is listed, then 
macOS is managing it in the background
.

â If 
no output appears
, Oversight 
isn't running properly
 and may need a reinstall.

ð Step 3: Check If Oversight Is Installed in the Right Place

Run:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Applications | grep Oversight

â If 
Oversight is listed
, it is correctly installed in Applications.

â If 
itâs missing
, then something removed or blocked it.

ð Step 4: If Oversight Still Isn't Found, Reinstall It

If any of the above checks 
fail to detect Oversight
, do a clean reinstall:

1ï¸â£ 
Uninstall completely
:

sh

Copy

sudo 

rm

 -rf /Applications/Oversight.app
sudo find /Library /Users -name 

"*Oversight*"

 -

exec

rm

 -rf {} +

2ï¸â£ 
Reinstall from 
Objective-See's Website

.

3ï¸â£ 
Manually launch it
:

sh

Copy

open /Applications/Oversight.app

4ï¸â£ 
Check again
:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep Oversight

ð 
Try these steps and let me know what you find!
 If we still can't locate Oversight, weâ
