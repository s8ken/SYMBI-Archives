ll do a deeper system check. ð

You said:

there is an action tab

ChatGPT said:

â 
If thereâs an "Action" tab in the alert youâre seeing, then the notifications are almost certainly coming from Oversight!
 ð

That means 
Oversight is working
 but is likely running in a way that doesnât show up in normal system process checks (
ps aux
, 
pgrep
, or 
log show
).

ð Next Steps (Optional - If You Want to Investigate Further)

If you want to 
verify Oversightâs background activity
, we can check if it's running as a 
launchd
 agent:

1ï¸â£ 
Check if macOS is launching it in the background

Run:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i oversight

â 
If Oversight appears
, it is correctly managed by 
launchd
 (even if it doesnât show up in 
ps aux
).

2ï¸â£ 
Manually Start and Stop Oversight (For Testing)

If you want to restart Oversight manually, try:

sh

Copy

launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.objective-see.oversight.plist
launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.objective-see.oversight.plist

Then recheck:

sh

Copy

launchctl list | grep -i oversight

â If it 
reappears
, it confirms Oversight is being managed at the system level.

ð¯ Conclusion: Oversight Is Working!

Since you're getting 
camera & microphone alerts with an "Action" tab
, Oversight 
is running as expected
âeven if itâs hidden from some system commands.

ð 
Youâre fully secured!
 ð¥

Let me know if you want to test anything else, but it looks like 
everything is working properly now!

asking to excecute script or binary when an even is detected

ChatGPT said:

â 
Yes! Oversight has an "Action" tab that allows you to execute a script or binary whenever an event is detected.
 This is a powerful feature if you want 
custom alerts, logs, or automated actions
 when your microphone or camera is activated.

ð How to Use Oversightâs "Action" Feature

You can configure Oversight to 
automatically take an action
 when a camera/mic event is detected. Hereâs how:

1ï¸â£ Create a Script for Automated Actions

We can create a script that 
logs details, alerts you, or even takes defensive action
 (e.g., shutting down an app).

Example: Simple Logging Script

This script 
logs the event
 and displays a macOS notification.

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

nano ~/oversight-alert.sh

Paste the following script:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

TIMESTAMP=$(

date

"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

)
LOGFILE=~/oversight_log.txt

echo

"[
$TIMESTAMP

] Oversight detected Camera/Mic access!" >> 

$LOGFILE

osascript -e 

'display notification "Oversight detected access!" with title "Security Alert"'

Save and exit:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

Make the script executable
:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x ~/oversight-alert.sh

2ï¸â£ Configure Oversight to Use This Script

Now, weâll configure Oversight to execute this script 
whenever the camera or mic is accessed
.

Open Oversight's Settings
.

Click the 
"Action"
 tab.

Click 
"Select Script"
 and 
choose
 the script you just created:

sh

Copy

~/oversight-alert.sh

Click 
"Save"
.

3ï¸â£ Test the Setup

To test, open 
Photo Booth or QuickTime Recording
.

â 
If everything is working
, you should:

See a notification.

Find a new log entry in 
~/oversight_log.txt
.

ð Advanced Actions

You can customize the script to:

Send an email or Telegram alert
.

Automatically kill a suspicious process
.

Block network access for certain apps
.

Let me know if you want a 
custom security action
, and I can help write a script for it! ðð

You said:

its wants me to select a path

ChatGPT said:

â 
Since Oversight wants a file path for the script, letâs ensure the script is correctly saved and accessible.

ð Step 1: Confirm the Script Path

The script must be saved in a 
permanent location
 that Oversight can access.

1ï¸â£ 
Move the script to a safe location:

sh

Copy

mv

 ~/oversight-alert.sh /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh
