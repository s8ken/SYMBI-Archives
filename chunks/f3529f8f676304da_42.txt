path:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

â If it appears, the script is in the correct place.

ð Step 2: Select the Script in Oversight

Open Oversight Settings
 â 
Go to the "Action" tab
.

Click 
"Select Script"
.

Navigate to

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh
 and select it.

Click 
"Save"
.

ð Step 3: Test the Setup

Now, test if Oversight correctly executes the script:

Open 
Photo Booth
 or 
QuickTime Recording
.

â If everything is working, you should:

See a 
notification
.

Find a 
log entry in 
/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

.

ð Need Custom Actions?

Do you want the script to 
block apps, kill a process, or send alerts
 when the camera/mic is accessed? Let me know, and I can customize it for you! ðð

You said:

ok so it warned me when I did the recording but I can't find the log file

â 
Great! Oversight successfully ran the script when you started recording!
 ð

Now, let's troubleshoot why the log file isnât appearing.

ð Step 1: Manually Run the Script to Check for Errors

Run the script manually to see if it logs properly:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Now, check if the log file exists:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â 
If the log file appears
, Oversight is working correctly, but the script might not have proper permissions.

â 
If the log file is missing, we need to fix permissions.

ð Step 2: Ensure the Script Can Write to the Log File

Modify the script so it 
ensures the log file is writable
:

1ï¸â£ Open the script for editing:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

2ï¸â£ 
Modify the script to explicitly set log file permissions:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

TIMESTAMP=$(

date

"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

)
LOGFILE=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt"

# Ensure log file exists

touch

$LOGFILE

chmod

 666 

$LOGFILE

# Allow read/write for all users

echo

"[
$TIMESTAMP

] Oversight detected Camera/Mic access!" >> 

$LOGFILE

osascript -e 

'display notification "Oversight detected access!" with title "Security Alert"'

3ï¸â£ 
Save the file:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

4ï¸â£ 
Make sure itâs executable:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

ð Step 3: Test Again

Manually run the script:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Check if the log file exists:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

Open the log file to confirm the entry was written:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

ð Step 4: Retest with Oversight

Now that we fixed the script:

Open 
Photo Booth
 or 
QuickTime Recording
 again.

Check the log file again:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â 
If the log file now updates, it means Oversight is executing the script properly!
 ð

ð 
Let me know what happens!
 If the log file still doesnât appear, weâll check Oversightâs execution logs. ðð

You said:

ok oversight detected access

ChatGPT said:

ð 
Awesome! Oversight is working perfectly now!
 ð¥ð

Now, whenever your 
camera or microphone is accessed
, Oversight will:

â 
Warn you with a notification

â 
Log the event in 
/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

ð Final Checks & Enhancements

Now that it's running smoothly, here are some optional tweaks:

1ï¸â£ Check Log File Updates in Real Time

To monitor new entries as they appear:

sh

Copy

tail

 -f /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

This will show logs 
in real-time
 whenever Oversight detects activity.

2ï¸â£ (Optional) Set Up an Email or Alert for Suspicious Activity

Do you want to be notified via email or another method when the camera/mic is used?

I can modify the script to 
send you an alert via email, Slack, or Telegram
 when Oversight detects access. Let me know if that interests you! ð
