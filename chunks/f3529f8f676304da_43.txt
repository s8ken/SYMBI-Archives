The script ran (Oversight detected access), but the log file wasnât created.

This means the script executed, but something prevented it from writing to the file. Let's fix that!

ð Step 1: Manually Create the Log File

To ensure the script can write to it, create the file yourself:

sh

Copy

touch

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

chmod

 666 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt  

# Give full read/write access

Then verify:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â If the file now exists, we can move to the next step.

ð Step 2: Modify the Script to Ensure It Can Write to the Log

Run:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Make sure the script looks like this:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

TIMESTAMP=$(

date

"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

)
LOGFILE=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt"

# Ensure the log file exists and has proper permissions

touch

$LOGFILE

chmod

 666 

$LOGFILE

echo

"[
$TIMESTAMP

] Oversight detected Camera/Mic access!" >> 

$LOGFILE

osascript -e 

'display notification "Oversight detected access!" with title "Security Alert"'

Then 
save the file
:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

Make sure itâs 
executable
:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

ð Step 3: Manually Run the Script & Check the Log

Now, manually execute it:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Check if the log file now exists:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â 
If the log file now updates, the script is working fine!
 ð

ð Step 4: Retest with Oversight

Now that we've ensured the script works:

Open 
Photo Booth or QuickTime Recording
.

After the Oversight alert, check the log file again:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â 
If it now logs properly, everything is fixed!

ð Let me know if the log file still doesn't update, and weâll troubleshoot further. ðð

Oops! The issue is that the command included a 
comment (# Give full read/write)
, and 
chmod
 tried to interpret it as a filename. Let's correct that.

ð Step 1: Create & Set Permissions for the Log File

Run these commands 
one at a time
:

sh

Copy

touch

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

chmod

 666 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

Then verify:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â 
If the file appears, itâs now ready for logging!
 ð

ð Step 2: Manually Run the Script & Check the Log

Now, execute the script manually:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

Then check the log file to see if it recorded the event:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â 
If you see a log entry, the script is working properly!

ð Step 3: Retest with Oversight

Open 
Photo Booth
 or 
QuickTime Recording
.

Once 
Oversight detects access
, check the log file again:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

â 
If it now logs properly, everything is fixed!

ð 
Let me know if the log file still doesnât update after an Oversight alert!
