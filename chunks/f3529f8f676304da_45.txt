If it says "disabled," SIP is off and this isnât the issue.

â 
If SIP is enabled, macOS might be blocking script execution. We might need to run this in recovery mode to allow scripts.

Great news! The script ran without errors, and it appears to be working fine now.

However, since the log file still doesnât show the entry, let's make sure the script is 
writing to the correct path
.

It looks like the log file should be in:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/oversight_log.txt

But in our previous steps, we were checking:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

ð Step 1: Check the Log Path

Letâs verify which file is being used:

1ï¸â£ 
Check the log file path:

sh

Copy

ls

 -l /Users/lcl/oversight_log.txt

2ï¸â£ If it exists, check if it has content:

sh

Copy

cat

 /Users/lcl/oversight_log.txt

ð Step 2: Ensure Correct Path in Script

If you want the log file to be in 
/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt
 instead of 
/Users/lcl/oversight_log.txt
, let's fix the script:

1ï¸â£ 
Edit the script:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

2ï¸â£ Change the 
LOGFILE path
 to 
/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt
:

sh

Copy

LOGFILE=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt"

3ï¸â£ 
Save the file
:

Press 
CTRL + X
, then 
Y
, then 
Enter
.

ð Step 3: Retest the Script

Run the script again:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/oversight-alert.sh

cat

 /Users/lcl/Documents/oversight_log.txt

Let me know if the log file is now updated
! If it's still not working, we'll check macOS security settings. ð

Success!
 The log file is now correctly updating with 
timestamped entries
 whenever Oversight detects camera/mic access! ð¥ð

ð Summary of the Setup:

Oversight is running
, and it's detecting camera/mic access.

The script you configured is now logging events in the correct file:

bash

Copy

/Users/lcl/oversight_log.txt

The script 
also triggers a notification
 when the camera or mic is accessed.

ð¯ What You Can Do Next:

Monitor the log in real-time
 using:

sh

Copy

tail

 -f /Users/lcl/oversight_log.txt

Customize the script further
 if you want to take additional actions when the camera/mic is accessed, like blocking specific apps or sending alerts.

ð 
Your system is now fully secured
 with custom notifications and logging from Oversight! Let me know if you need further tweaks or want to explore additional security measures! ðð
