It looks like you're encountering an issue with 
nano
 trying to save the file. The message 
cannot open
 indicates there may have been an accidental key press during the save process, which caused some confusion.

Letâs go step-by-step to fix it:

ð Step 1: Exit 
nano
 Without Saving

First, let's exit the current 
nano
 session without saving:

Press 
CTRL + C

 to cancel the save operation.

It will ask if you want to save:

Press 
N

 to not save any changes and exit 
nano
.

ð Step 2: Reopen and Save the File Correctly

Open the file again:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Write or paste your script
 into the editor.

Save the file
 properly by pressing:

CTRL + X
 (to exit)

When it asks
: 
Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES)?

Press 
Y

 to save changes.

Then
: When asked for the file name, just press 
Enter
 to confirm the path 
/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh
.

ð Step 3: Make It Executable

Once the script is saved, make sure itâs executable:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

ð Step 4: Test the Script

To verify it works, run the script manually:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Let me know if this resolves the issue!

No worries! If the file was saved but didn't work as expected, we can fix it easily.

Hereâs what to do next:

ð Step 1: Open the Script for Editing

Letâs open the script again to check its contents:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

ð Step 2: Verify Script Content

Make sure the script is written correctly. It should look like this:

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"

CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults 

read

 com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists

if

 [ -f 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

    LAST_SETTINGS=$(

cat

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

")

if

 [ 

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" != 

"
$LAST_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

echo

"ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!"

 | mail -s 

"Accessibility Settings Change Alert"

 your-email@example.com

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

else

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

ð Step 3: Save Again

Once the script looks correct, you can save it properly by following these steps:

Press 
CTRL + X

 to exit.

Press 
Y

 to confirm saving changes.

Press 
Enter

 to confirm the file path 
/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh
.

ð Step 4: Make It Executable Again

Ensure itâs executable:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

ð Step 5: Test the Script

Finally, run the script to see if it logs properly:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Let me know how it goes or if you encounter any issues! If the script still isn't running, we can troubleshoot further.

You said:

#!/bin/bash
ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS="/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"
CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults read com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists
