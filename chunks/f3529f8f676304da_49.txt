It looks like the script is almost there, but it's 
missing the closing part of the 
mail
 command
. Let's fix that by completing the 
mail
 command properly so the script sends the email alert when it detects a change in accessibility settings.

ð Corrected Script

sh

Copy

#!/bin/bash

ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS=

"/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_settings.txt"

CURRENT_SETTINGS=$(defaults 

read

 com.apple.universalaccess)

# Check if the settings file exists

if

 [ -f 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

    LAST_SETTINGS=$(

cat

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

")

if

 [ 

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" != 

"
$LAST_SETTINGS

" ]; 

then

echo

"ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!"

 | mail -s 

"Accessibility Settings Change Alert"

 your-email@example.com

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

else

echo

"
$CURRENT_SETTINGS

" > 

"
$ACCESSIBILITY_SETTINGS

"

fi

Explanation:

The 
mail command
 is now completed with the full syntax:

sh

Copy

echo

"ALERT: Accessibility settings have changed!"

 | mail -s 

"Accessibility Settings Change Alert"

 your-email@example.com

Replace 
your-email@example.com
 with the actual email address where you want to receive alerts.

ð Step 1: Save the Updated Script

Open the script again to edit:

sh

Copy

nano /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Replace the existing content with the 
corrected script
 above.

Save and exit
 the editor:

Press 
CTRL + X
 to exit.

Press 
Y
 to confirm saving.

Press 
Enter
 to save with the same name.

ð Step 2: Make the Script Executable

If it's not already executable, run this command:

sh

Copy

chmod

 +x /Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

ð Step 3: Test the Script

To test it manually:

sh

Copy

/Users/lcl/Documents/accessibility_monitor.sh

Check your email inbox for an alert. If everything works, the script should notify you if accessibility settings change.

If the script 
looks like it worked
 but you're still waiting for the email, there are a few things we need to check and troubleshoot. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you investigate:

ð Step 1: Check if the

 Command Is Working

First, let's ensure that the
