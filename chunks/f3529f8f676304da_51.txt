Save the script and run it again. The script should now output the current and last settings to the terminal, allowing you to see whatâs happening.

Next Steps:

Check the terminal output
 after running the updated script. This will help us understand what is being compared and why itâs not triggering the email.

Let me know
 the output of the script, and weâll figure out the next steps together! ð

Awesome!
 I'm glad it's working now! It sounds like you've successfully set up the script to monitor your accessibility settings and send an alert when changes occur. ð¯ð

working so one more thing - how can I ensure if they do get into my system they are restricted from accessing or doing too much damage in terminal?

ChatGPT said:

To ensure that if someone gains unauthorized access to your system, they are 
restricted from causing damage
 through 
Terminal
, we need to implement several security measures that 
limit their access
 and 
control system behavior
.

Here are a few key strategies you can use to safeguard your system:

ð Step 1: Enable FileVault (Full Disk Encryption)

This ensures that 
your entire disk is encrypted
 and only accessible by you with the correct password.

Turn on FileVault
 (if not already enabled):

Go to 
System Preferences
 â 
Security & Privacy
 â 
FileVault
.

Click on 
Turn On FileVault
.

This will require your password for decryption, preventing anyone without your password from accessing your files (including via Terminal).

ð Step 2: Use Strong Passwords

Make sure that all your user accounts are protected with 
strong passwords
 to prevent unauthorized access.

Change your password
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 â 
Users & Groups
.

Change the password for your user account and any other accounts that may be vulnerable.

Consider using a 
password manager
 to generate and store strong, unique passwords for each account.

ð Step 3: Limit sudo (Superuser) Access

Restricting 

sudo

 privileges prevents unauthorized users from executing administrative commands.

Modify 
sudoers
 file
:

Open Terminal and type:

sh

Copy

sudo visudo

Edit sudoers file
 to limit who can run 
sudo
 commands:

You can restrict 
sudo
 access to only your user account.

For example, ensure your user account is the only one listed under the 
sudo
 group.

Disable sudo for other accounts
:

If you suspect that there are rogue accounts with 
sudo
 access, remove their entries or disable them.

ð Step 4: Use a Guest User Account (or disable all other accounts)

If you're concerned about unauthorized access, 
disable unused accounts
 or enable a 
Guest account
 with limited access.

Disable unused accounts
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 â 
Users & Groups
.

Disable any unused accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

Enable Guest User
 (with restricted access):

Under 
Users & Groups
, enable the 
Guest User
 account and restrict their ability to modify system files.

Limit the Guest accountâs Terminal access
:

Disable Terminal
 for the Guest user by removing Terminal from the 
Applications folder
 for that user.

Or, use
