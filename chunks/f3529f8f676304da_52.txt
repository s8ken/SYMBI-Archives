a tool like 
Parental Controls
 to prevent them from using Terminal.

ð Step 5: Enable System Integrity Protection (SIP)

System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 helps prevent 
critical system files
 from being modified, even by the root user.

Ensure SIP is enabled
:

To check SIP status, run:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

If SIP is disabled, you can 
re-enable it
 by following these steps:

Restart your Mac in 
Recovery Mode
 (hold 
Command + R
 while booting).

Open 
Terminal
 from the 
Utilities
 menu.

Run the command:

sh

Copy

csrutil 

enable

Restart your Mac.

ð Step 6: Monitor and Restrict Shell Access

You can limit which users have access to 
Terminal
 or the 
bash/zsh
 shell.

Restrict access to Terminal
:

You can remove the ability for other users to access 
Terminal
 by editing their 
profile
.

Modify the 

/etc/shells

 file to only include authorized shell paths (like 
/bin/bash
 or 
/bin/zsh
 for yourself).

Limit access to specific users
:

You can prevent certain users from logging into the system by adding them to the 
âno loginâ shell
.

Example:

sh

Copy

sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin <username>

This command sets the user's shell to 
nologin
, effectively disabling shell access.

ð Step 7: Audit and Monitor System Activity

Use monitoring tools to track and alert you to unusual activities, including changes in the system files, processes, or network connections.

LuLu
, 
Oversight
, and other tools you've set up will monitor external processes, but 
you can go further
 by setting up audit trails.

Install Audit Framework
 (
auditd
):

You can use the 
audit framework
 to log system events, including command executions in Terminal.

The command:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.auditd.plist

ð Step 8: Use a Security Software

In addition to the built-in macOS security tools, consider using 
third-party security software
 for continuous monitoring and threat detection.

Install Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software
:

Some options include 
Malwarebytes
, 
Sophos
, and others.

Endpoint Security Solutions
:

Solutions like 
CrowdStrike
 or 
SentinelOne
 offer advanced monitoring and active prevention.

ð Step 9: Keep macOS and Apps Updated

Ensure that both 
macOS
 and all installed apps are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Enable automatic updates
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 â 
Software Update
.

Ensure 
automatic updates
 are turned on for security patches.

Next Steps:

By implementing these measures, you 
greatly reduce the risk
 of someone being able to cause damage through Terminal or unauthorized access. If you want help with any specific step, or if you'd like to go through more advanced security measures, let me know! ð

as I am the only user is it best to have a separate admin account that retains the super admin and restrict myself to a standard user? I find I have to enter the admin password a lot which could compromise my system if they are key logging me

ChatGPT said:

Yes, it's generally a 
good security practice
 to have a 
separate admin account
 and use a 
standard user account
 for daily activities, even if you're the only person using the system. This approach adds an extra layer of protection and reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially if you're concerned about 
keylogging
 or other attacks.

Benefits of Using a Standard User Account:

Reduced Attack Surface
:

When logged into a standard account, 
malicious processes
 won't have admin privileges by default. This can prevent unauthorized changes to critical system files.

Minimized Risk
:

If an attacker gains access to your system, they'll have to first elevate privileges (which can be difficult without your password) to perform harmful actions, such as installing malware or modifying system files.

Controlled Password Prompts
:

While youâll still be prompted for an 
admin password
 for specific tasks (like installing software or
