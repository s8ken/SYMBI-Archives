modifying system settings), 
using a standard account
 limits the frequency of these prompts since you won't be making system-wide changes constantly.

Keylogging Protection
:

If you're using a standard account, the 
admin password
 will only be required when you're doing admin-level tasks. Even if an attacker is logging keystrokes, they wonât have access to critical admin features unless they somehow bypass your standard user login and gain admin privileges.

Steps to Set Up a Separate Admin Account
:

Create a Separate Admin Account
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 â 
Users & Groups
.

Unlock
 the padlock by entering your admin password.

Click the 
"+"
 button to create a new user.

Select 
Administrator
 as the user type.

Set a strong password for this admin account.

Switch to Standard User
:

Select your current account (which is an admin account).

Change the 
account type
 to 
Standard
.

Now, when you log in to this account, you'll only have 
standard permissions
 and will need to enter the 
admin password
 for tasks requiring elevated privileges.

Enable FileVault
 for Extra Security:

With FileVault enabled, your entire disk is encrypted, so even if someone gains physical access to your Mac, they wonât be able to access your files without the password.

Keep Your Admin Account Secure
:

Set a strong password for your admin account and 
donât use it for daily activities
. Use the standard account for regular tasks and only switch to the admin account when absolutely necessary.

Security Considerations:

Admin account for system changes only
: Use the admin account only when performing system-level tasks like software installations, network settings, or system configurations.

Use password managers
: To keep your passwords secure, use a password manager so you don't have to remember long, complex passwords and you donât expose them via keylogging or other risks.

Secure password recovery
: In case you forget your admin password, set up a 
password recovery option
 or enable 
Apple ID recovery
 to regain access to your Mac.

Conclusion:

By using a 
standard user account
 for daily tasks and keeping a 
separate admin account
 for system changes, you make it harder for attackers to access sensitive system settings, and 
you reduce the risk of compromise
 if they are keylogging or trying to gain unauthorized access.

ok cool and so now I want to make sure my router is secure and that dns settings and vans are used (or iCloud relay)

Securing your 
router
, setting up 
DNS settings
, and ensuring that 
VPNs
 (or 
iCloud Relay
) are used are all essential steps for 
securing your network
 and 
privacy
. Here's a step-by-step guide for securing each of these areas:

ð Step 1: Secure Your Router

Change Default Login Credentials:

Most routers come with default usernames and passwords (often "admin" for both). Change these immediately to something 
strong
 and 
unique
.

Access the routerâs settings by entering its 
IP address
 in your browser (typically something like 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
). Refer to your router's manual for the exact IP address.

Change the admin username and password
 under the "Administration" or "Security" section.

Enable WPA3 Encryption
:

WPA3 is the latest and most secure Wi-Fi encryption standard. Itâs a good idea to enable it (if your router supports it) for 
maximum security
.

Go to the 
Wi-Fi settings
 of your router and set the 
Wi-Fi encryption
 to WPA3. If WPA3 is unavailable, use WPA2.

Disable Remote Management
:

Disable 
remote management
 on your router. This prevents anyone from accessing the router's settings over the internet.

In the routerâs admin settings, look for 
Remote Management
 or 
Remote Access
 and disable it.

Change the Default SSID (Wi-Fi Name)
:

Change the 
Wi-Fi SSID
 (network name) to something unique that 
doesn't identify the router model
 or you
