r location.

This adds a layer of obfuscation to make it harder for attackers to identify your router.

Enable a Guest Network
:

If guests need access to your Wi-Fi, enable a 
guest network
. Make sure this network is 
isolated from your main network
 so that guests cannot access your devices.

Update Router Firmware
:

Ensure that your router firmware is up to date to protect against vulnerabilities. Check your routerâs admin page for firmware updates and apply them regularly.

ð Step 2: Use Secure DNS Settings

Switch to Privacy-Focused DNS Servers
:

Using DNS servers that prioritize 
privacy and security
 is essential. Consider switching to a third-party DNS service that doesnât track your browsing activity.

Here are a few popular options:

Cloudflare DNS
 (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1): A fast and privacy-respecting DNS service.

Google DNS
 (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4): A widely used and secure DNS service.

OpenDNS
 (208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220): Provides DNS filtering and security features.

Set Custom DNS in Router Settings
:

Log into your routerâs settings (as mentioned in Step 1).

Find the 
DNS settings
 section (usually under 
Internet
 or 
WAN settings
).

Replace the default DNS servers with one of the options listed above.

Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS
:

If your router supports it, enable 
DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
 or 
DNS-over-TLS
. This encrypts your DNS queries, making them harder for attackers to intercept.

ð Step 3: Use VPNs or iCloud Relay for Privacy

Use a VPN for Network Traffic Privacy
:

A 
VPN
 (Virtual Private Network) routes your internet traffic through a secure server, hiding your IP address and encrypting your connection.

There are many good VPN providers, including:

ExpressVPN

NordVPN

ProtonVPN
 (good for privacy)

TunnelBear
 (easy-to-use)

Set up VPN on your router
: If your router supports it, you can set up a VPN directly on your router, so all devices connected to your network are automatically secured with the VPN.

Enable iCloud Private Relay
 (for Apple Devices):

iCloud Private Relay
 is a 
built-in feature
 for iCloud+ users that ensures your internet traffic is encrypted and your IP address is hidden.

Enable iCloud Private Relay
:

Go to 
Settings
 â 
Apple ID
 â 
iCloud
 â 
Private Relay
.

Turn on 
Private Relay
.

This will route your web traffic through two separate internet relays to keep your browsing private.

Set Up VPN on Your Device
:

If you donât have a router-level VPN setup, you can install a VPN directly on your Mac, iPhone, or other devices.

Once installed, ensure the VPN is always 
on
 when youâre connected to the internet, especially on public or untrusted networks.

ð Step 4: Test Your Network Security

Check for DNS Leaks
:

Use an online tool like 

DNS Leak Test

 to verify that your 
DNS requests
 are going through the DNS servers you've set up and not leaking to your ISP or others.

Check for IP Leaks
:

When using a VPN, check for 
IP leaks
 using sites like 

IPLeak.net

. If your VPN is working correctly, your 
real IP address
 should be hidden.

ð Step 5: Additional Security Measures

Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
: Whenever possible, enable 
2FA
 for any services that support it (like iCloud, Google, etc.).

Firewall
: Ensure your routerâs firewall is enabled and configured properly. This adds an additional layer of security by blocking incoming connections from unauthorized devices.

Monitor Your Network
: Use tools like 
Wireshark
 or 
GlassWire
 to monitor your network traffic and check for suspicious activity.

Conclusion:

By securing your router, changing DNS settings, and using a VPN or iCloud Relay, you're taking several important steps to protect your network and online privacy. These measures help safeguard against unauthorized access and minimize the risk of data leakage.
