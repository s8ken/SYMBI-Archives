To find and configure 
DNS settings
 on a 
Netgear Nighthawk router
, follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Guide to Change DNS Settings on a Netgear Nighthawk Router:

Log into the Router's Admin Page
:

Open a web browser on a device connected to your network.

Type your router's 
IP address
 in the browserâs address bar. The default IP address for most Netgear routers is usually:

192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1

Press 
Enter
.

Enter Login Credentials
:

You will be prompted for a username and password.

The default username is 

admin

.

The default password is 

password

 (unless it was changed).

If youâve changed these, use your custom login credentials.

Navigate to the DNS Settings
:

Once logged in, you will be in the 
routerâs dashboard
.

Look for a section like 
âAdvancedâ
 or 
âInternet Setupâ
.

Under 
Advanced
 â 
Setup
, look for 
WAN Settings
 or 
Internet Settings
.

In newer models, this might be located under 
Advanced
 â 
Setup
 â 
WAN
.

Locate the DNS Settings
:

Look for the 
DNS Settings
 section.

You should see an option to set 
Primary DNS
 and 
Secondary DNS
.

Change DNS Settings
:

Select 
Use These DNS Servers
 (or a similar option).

Enter the 
DNS server addresses
 you wish to use:

Cloudflare DNS
:

Primary DNS: 
1.1.1.1

Secondary DNS: 
1.0.0.1

Google DNS
:

Primary DNS: 
8.8.8.8

Secondary DNS: 
8.8.4.4

OpenDNS
:

Primary DNS: 
208.67.222.222

Secondary DNS: 
208.67.220.220

Save the Settings
:

After entering the DNS server addresses, click 
Apply
 or 
Save
 to save the changes.

Test the New DNS Configuration
:

To test if your DNS settings are working, you can use the 
command prompt/terminal
 on your computer:

On 
Mac
 or 
Windows
, open the terminal/command prompt and type:

bash

Copy

nslookup google.com

This will return the IP address associated with 
google.com
, confirming that DNS queries are being resolved through your new DNS servers.

Optional: Enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) if Supported

Some newer Netgear routers may support 
DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
 for enhanced privacy. If your model supports it, you can enable it in the DNS settings. 
DNS-over-HTTPS
 encrypts DNS queries, preventing third parties from intercepting or manipulating them.

Summary of DNS Servers to Use
:

Here are a few DNS services you might consider for increased privacy and performance:

Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
: Fast and privacy-focused DNS.

Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
: Reliable and fast DNS.

OpenDNS (208.67.222.222)
: Offers customizable DNS filtering and security.

Conclusion
:

After following these steps, your router will use your selected 
DNS servers
 instead of the default ones from your ISP. This will improve both your 
internet speed
 and 
privacy
.

 and

Go to "Advanced" Settings

In the routerâs admin page, click on
