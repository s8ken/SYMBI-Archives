r 
Advanced Setup
 or 
WAN Setup
.

Look for DNS Settings under "Internet" or "WAN"
:

Under Advanced Setup or Internet Setup
, there should be a place where you can configure the 
DNS settings
. If itâs not visible, the DNS settings might be automatically handled by your ISP. In this case, look for an option to 
Manually set DNS
 or 
Custom DNS
.

DNS Configuration
 options might look like this:

Primary DNS
: (Enter your preferred DNS server, e.g., 
1.1.1.1
 for Cloudflare or 
8.8.8.8
 for Google)

Secondary DNS
: (Enter a backup DNS server, e.g., 
1.0.0.1
 for Cloudflare or 
8.8.4.4
 for Google)

Change the DNS Servers
:

Select the option
 to manually configure DNS settings. This will allow you to 
enter the DNS addresses
 for your chosen DNS service.

Apply Settings
:

After entering the desired DNS settings, make sure to click 
Apply
 or 
Save
 at the bottom to confirm the changes.

The router might reboot, and your network will start using the new DNS settings.

If You Still Canât Find DNS Settings in WAN Setup:

If you canât find the DNS settings under 
WAN Setup
, it could be possible that your router is using a default 
automatic DNS setup
 provided by your 
ISP
. In this case, you might want to look in the 
LAN setup
 or 
DHCP settings
 for options to customize DNS.

Alternatively, you can try the 
routerâs mobile app
 (if available) or consult the 
Netgear support documentation
 for your specific router model to locate and modify DNS settings.

Setting DNS on the Devices Directly (Alternative Solution)
:

If the router doesn't provide an easy way to configure DNS settings, you can 
manually set DNS
 on each device connected to your network:

On Mac
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 â 
Network
 â 
Advanced
 â 
DNS
 tab.

Add your preferred DNS servers (e.g., 
1.1.1.1
 for Cloudflare).

On Windows
:

Go to 
Network & Internet Settings
 â 
Change adapter settings
 â 
Right-click your network connection
 â 
Properties
.

Select 
Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)
, click 
Properties
, and enter the DNS addresses.

Conclusion
:

By following these steps, you should be able to find and modify the DNS settings on your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
 or configure them directly on your devices if needed. Using 
privacy-respecting DNS servers
 like 
Cloudflare
 or 
Google DNS
 will enhance your online privacy and security.

ok got it - what should I I choose for router Mac address??

ChatGPT said:

When choosing or configuring the 
MAC address
 for your router, the 
MAC address
 (Media Access Control address) is typically assigned by the manufacturer and is used to uniquely identify the device on your network. 
Most routers come with a factory-set MAC address
, and in most cases, you 
donât need to change it
.

However, in some situations, you may want to configure or 
change the MAC address
 for reasons such as 
privacy
 or 
network configuration
.

When You Might Want to Change the MAC Address:

Privacy Concerns
:

Changing the MAC address can help prevent your 
ISP
 or 
local networks
 from tracking you by your MAC address.

Avoiding Device Restrictions
:

Some networks or ISPs might restrict access based on the MAC address. In these cases, changing your router's MAC address can help you bypass such restrictions.

Bypass ISP Restrictions
:

Some ISPs limit the number of devices that can connect by MAC address. If you change the routerâs MAC address, you might be able to 
reset these limits
.

Network Configuration
:

If youâre setting up your router in a specific environment (e.g., for certain advanced network configurations), you might need to manually set a 
custom MAC address
 to avoid conflicts.

How to Change the MAC Address on Your Router:

Step-by-Step Process (Netgear Nighthawk Router)
:

Log Into the Router
:

Open a web browser and go to the 
router login page
 (typically 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
).
