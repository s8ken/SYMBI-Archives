ame and password.

Go to Advanced Settings
:

Once logged in, click on the 
"Advanced"
 tab from the main navigation menu.

Locate the MAC Address Settings
:

Find the section for 
"WAN Setup"
 or 
"Advanced Setup"
.

Look for an option related to the 
MAC address
. In some routers, you will see a field called 
"MAC Address Clone"
 or 
"MAC Address"
.

Enable MAC Address Clone (if applicable)
:

If your router has 
MAC Address Clone
 settings, enable it. This allows you to manually set a new MAC address.

Set the MAC Address
:

If you are asked to input a MAC address, you can either use the 
default MAC address
 provided by the router, or you can enter a 
random or custom MAC address
. MAC addresses typically follow the format 
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
, where 
X
 is a hexadecimal digit.

Apply the Settings
:

After setting the desired MAC address, make sure to 
save or apply the changes
.

Your router may restart for the new MAC address to take effect.

What MAC Address Should You Choose?

Default Factory MAC Address
: If you donât need to change the MAC address, leave it as is. The factory-set MAC address is usually sufficient for most users.

Custom or Random MAC Address
: If you want to manually set it, you can either:

Use a random MAC address generator to ensure uniqueness.

Choose a MAC address that does not conflict with other devices on your network.

Note
: Changing the MAC address can disrupt the connection temporarily, so make sure to apply the changes carefully and restart the router if necessary.

Should You Change Your Routerâs MAC Address?

For 
most users
, changing the routerâs MAC address 
is not necessary
 unless you have specific privacy or network configuration requirements. The 
default MAC address
 should work fine, but if you're concerned about privacy or need to reset device restrictions, you can change it.

Conclusion
:

If you don't have a specific reason to change your router's MAC address, itâs usually best to 
leave it as is
.

If you do decide to change it, make sure to pick a 
unique MAC address
 (you can generate one randomly) to avoid conflicts on your network.

Given your options:

Use Default
: This option uses the routerâs 
factory-assigned MAC address
, which is typically fine for most users. Itâs the most 
common
 choice unless you have specific privacy or network configuration requirements.

Use Computer
: This option would allow you to clone the MAC address of your 
computer
. Essentially, your router would adopt the same MAC address as your computer. This can be useful in certain scenarios, like when your ISP or network is only allowing access from specific MAC addresses. However, itâs generally not necessary unless youâre trying to 
bypass restrictions
 or 
mimic your computer's network identity
.

Use This MAC Address (Specify)
: This option allows you to manually input a 
custom MAC address
. You could use this option if you need a 
specific MAC address
 for privacy reasons or other advanced configurations. If you choose this option, you can 
generate a random MAC address
 to ensure it doesn't conflict with any other devices in your network.

Which Option to Choose?

For Most Users
: If you donât have a specific need to change the MAC address, 
use the default
 MAC address. Itâs usually sufficient, and thereâs no real need to change it unless you are trying to address particular network restrictions or privacy concerns.

For Privacy or Bypassing Restrictions
: If youâre concerned about tracking or want to avoid your ISP or other networks identifying your device by MAC address, you could opt to 
use a custom MAC address
. You can generate a random MAC address using a MAC address generator.

For Specific Network Configuration
: If youâre trying to replicate the MAC address of a
