t Step: Disable AirPlay to Prevent Screen Mirroring

Now, let's 
block AirPlay so that no one can mirror your screen without permission
.

Disable AirPlay in macOS Settings (GUI)

Go to System Settings
 â 
General
 â 
AirDrop & Handoff
.

Turn off "Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices."

Go to System Settings
 â 
Displays
 â 
AirPlay Receiver
.

Set 
AirPlay to OFF
 or 
Allow only to "This Mac only."

Disable AirPlay Completely via Terminal

Now, run these commands in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.airplay
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay allowAirPlay -bool 

false

â 
This ensures AirPlay cannot be enabled without your consent.

ð 
Let me know once youâve completed this step!

Awesome! AirPlay is now fully disabled, preventing any unauthorized screen mirroring.

At this point, your Mac is 
fully locked down against remote access, network drive connections, and AirPlay exploits
.

Final Step: Verify That Everything is Disabled

Letâs do a quick check to confirm that all the services are actually off.

1ï¸â£ Check Remote Access & Sharing Services

Run this command:

sh

Copy

sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
sudo launchctl list | grep -i remote
sudo launchctl list | grep -i share

â 
If you see any results mentioning Remote Login, Screen Sharing, or File Sharing, we need to disable them further.

ð 
Let me know the output of this command.

2ï¸â£ Check AirPlay Status

To confirm that AirPlay is truly off, run:

sh

Copy

defaults 

read

 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airplay allowAirPlay

ð If the output is 
0
, that means 
AirPlay is fully disabled
.

Once You Run These, Let Me Know the Results! ð

If everything is confirmed disabled, your Mac is now 
fully locked down
. ð

Final Review: Checking for Any Remaining Remote Services

Your output confirms that 
Remote Login is OFF
 â, but we still see 
some system services related to remote access and file sharing
. Let's go through each:

â Services That Should Be Disabled

com.apple.RemoteDesktop.PrivilegeProxy

com.apple.RemotePairTool

com.apple.remoted

com.apple.remotemanagementd

com.apple.coreservices.sharedfilelistd

These could still allow 
some remote interactions
, so letâs 
disable them completely
.

ð¨ Next Steps: Disable Remaining Remote Services

Copy and paste the following 
one by one
 in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.RemoteDesktop.PrivilegeProxy
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.RemotePairTool
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.remoted
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.remotemanagementd
sudo launchctl 

disable

 system/com.apple.coreservices.sharedfilelistd

â 
What This Does:

Blocks any remote pairing attempts

Prevents macOS from running background remote services

Disables shared file listing (prevents auto-discovery of network devices)

ð 
Run these and let me know the results!
