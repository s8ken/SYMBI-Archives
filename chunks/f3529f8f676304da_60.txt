 insecure. Block if you donât use FTP.

Port 23 (Telnet)
: Used for remote command-line access. Telnet is often insecure and unencrypted, so it's a good idea to block it unless you specifically need it.

Port 25 (SMTP)
: Used for 
email
 sending. If you're not running a mail server, you should block this port to prevent email spammers from using your network.

Port 445 (Microsoft-DS)
: This port is associated with 
Windows file sharing
 and 
remote desktop access
. Block it if you're not using those services, as itâs a common attack vector.

Port 3389 (RDP)
: This port is used for 
Remote Desktop Protocol
 (RDP). If you donât need remote desktop access, block this port to avoid brute-force attacks.

Port 1080 (SOCKS Proxy)
: Often targeted by attackers to tunnel unauthorized traffic through your network.

Port 1433 (SQL Server)
: Used by 
Microsoft SQL Server
. Block if you're not running SQL server applications.

Other Commonly Blocked Ports
:

Ports 69, 514, 161, 162
: Associated with 
TFTP
 (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), 
Syslog
, and 
SNMP
 (Simple Network Management Protocol). These can sometimes be used by attackers for network discovery.

How to Block Ports on a Netgear Nighthawk Router
:

Log into your routerâs admin page
:

Type 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
 in your browser.

Log in with your routerâs username and password.

Go to the "Advanced" section
:

Click on the 
"Advanced"
 tab at the top of the page.

Navigate to "Security"
:

Under 
Advanced Setup
, look for 
"Security"
 or 
"Port Forwarding/Port Triggering"
.

Some routers have an option like 
"Blocked Services"
 or 
"Access Control"
.

Add a new rule to block specific ports
:

Find the section where you can 
block
 ports. This might be under 
"Firewall"
 or 
"Port Filtering"
.

Add rules for the specific ports you want to block (e.g., port 23 for Telnet, port 3389 for RDP).

Apply the changes
:

Once the ports are blocked, make sure to 
save
 and 
apply
 the changes.

You may need to restart the router for the settings to take effect.

When Should You Not Block Ports?

Essential Services
:

If you rely on certain services (like email or remote access), blocking their ports could cause disruptions. Make sure you know the ports your services use before blocking them.

Active VPN or Remote Access Services
:

If you use a 
VPN
 or other 
remote access
 services, ensure that the required ports (like 1194 for OpenVPN or 443 for HTTPS) are 
not blocked
.

Things to Keep in Mind
:

Test Services After Blocking
:

After blocking ports, verify that your internet connection and services are still working properly.

Use Port Forwarding for Allowed Services
:

For services you want to allow, use 
port forwarding
 instead of opening all ports.

Update Firmware
:

Keep your router firmware up to date, as some ports may be targeted in new vulnerabilities. Regular updates ensure your router has the latest security features.

Conclusion
:

Blocking unused and vulnerable ports can help improve your network security by 
limiting potential attack surfaces
. However, make sure you only block ports you know you donât need, and remember that some services (like remote desktop or email) require specific ports to be open.

You said:

so is it port forwarding or trigerring?

ChatGPT said:

Both 
port forwarding
 and 
port triggering
 are ways of configuring how data is directed to specific devices on your network, but they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

Port Forwarding
:

Port Forwarding
 is when you explicitly 
forward incoming traffic
 on a specific port from the internet to a specific device or service inside your network.

This is used when you want a service or device on your internal network to be 
directly accessible from the outside world
.

When to use
:

If you're hosting a web server, a game server, or any se
