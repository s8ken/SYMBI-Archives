rvice that should be accessible from outside your network, you would 
forward
 specific ports.

Common for 
static IP configurations
, where the device/service you're forwarding to will always need the same port to be open.

Port Triggering
:

Port Triggering
 is when you 
allow incoming traffic on specific ports
, but only when a device inside your network sends outbound traffic on a specific port first.

This is useful when you want a port to be opened temporarily when a specific application or service triggers it (for example, when playing a game or using a communication app).

When to use
:

If you want to dynamically open ports only when specific applications on your network are active (for example, gaming consoles or communication apps that require temporary port access).

Port triggering only 
temporarily opens ports
 while the service/application that triggered it is running.

So Which One Should You Use?

For most cases
 where you need to 
permanently open a port
 (e.g., for a web server, VPN, or game server), 
use port forwarding
.

You specify the exact port to be open and direct the traffic to a device inside your network.

For temporary or dynamic port needs
 (e.g., for certain games or applications that only need ports open while they are running), 
use port triggering
.

Summary
:

Port Forwarding
 = 
Permanent access
 (e.g., web servers, gaming servers).

Port Triggering
 = 
Temporary access
 (e.g., gaming or apps that need dynamic port access).

In your case, for security or privacy reasons, 
port forwarding
 would be used if you need to open specific ports for a service, and 
port triggering
 would be used for applications that 
dynamically need access
 to ports when they are active.

yes I need help blocking the common ports you mentioned on the nighthawk

To block common ports on your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
, you will typically use the 
Access Control
 or 
Firewall
 settings in the routerâs admin interface. Hereâs a step-by-step guide to help you block ports like 
FTP (21)
, 
Telnet (23)
, 
SMTP (25)
, 
RDP (3389)
, and others.

Steps to Block Ports on Your Netgear Nighthawk Router:

Log into Your Routerâs Admin Page
:

Open a web browser and go to the 
router's login page
. The default IP is typically 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
.

Enter your 
username
 and 
password
. If you havenât changed them, they may be 
admin
 and 
password
 by default (or as set by your ISP).

Navigate to the Advanced Settings
:

Once logged in, click on the 
"Advanced"
 tab in the top navigation menu.

Go to Security or Firewall Settings
:

Under the 
Advanced
 section, look for an option such as 
"Security"
 or 
"Firewall"
.

This section should allow you to configure 
access rules
 or 
port filtering
.

Add a Port Blocking Rule
:

Look for 
"Blocked Services"
 or 
"Port Filtering"
 under Security or Firewall settings.

In this section, you can 
add custom port blocking rules
. Hereâs how to block common ports:

Port 21 (FTP)
: For blocking FTP.

Port 23 (Telnet)
: For blocking Telnet.

Port 25 (SMTP)
: For blocking email sending.

Port 3389 (RDP)
: For blocking Remote Desktop Protocol.

To block these ports:

Enter the port number
 (e.g., 
21
 for FTP) in the designated field for 
Inbound or Outbound Ports
.

Choose the action
: Select 
"Block"
 or 
"Deny"
 for the action.

Apply
 the settings to each port you want to block.

Save and Apply the Settings
:

After entering the port numbers you want to block, make sure to 
save or apply
 the changes. This will immediately block those ports from being accessible over the internet.

Restart the Router (Optional)
:

After applying the changes, you may want to 
restart your router
 to ensure the new settings take effect properly.
