FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Often used by malware and unsecured file transfers.

23

Telnet

Insecure remote login; should be replaced with SSH (port 22).

25

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer)

Block if not using an email server; prevents spamming.

3389

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

Often targeted for remote access; block unless you use RDP.

445

SMB (Server Message Block)

Can be exploited for network file sharing vulnerabilities.

5900

VNC (Virtual Network Computing)

Often targeted for unauthorized access to your system.

Additional Tips
:

Use VPNs
: If you require remote access to your network (e.g., for work), consider using a 
VPN
 instead of leaving RDP or Telnet ports open.

Test Services
: After blocking ports, make sure all the services you need are still functioning as expected.

Use Strong Passwords
: Ensure that all services that remain open are secured with strong, unique passwords.

Conclusion
:

Blocking common ports will reduce your exposure to certain types of attacks. 
Port forwarding
 or 
triggering
 should only be used if you need to allow specific services or devices to communicate through your router. For added security, blocking ports that are 
not in use
 will reduce the chance of exploitation.

would it be block sites or block services perhaps?

On your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
, the option you're likely looking for would be 
"Block Services"
, not "Block Sites." The reason for this is that 
"Block Services"
 allows you to 
block specific ports
 or protocols that are commonly used for services like FTP, Telnet, and RDP, which is what you're trying to accomplish.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each option and what you should be looking for:

Block Services (What You Need)
:

Block Services
 allows you to 
block specific ports or network services
 such as FTP (Port 21), Telnet (Port 23), RDP (Port 3389), etc.

This feature is what you would use to block services that rely on certain ports to function. This is the setting you want to use if you're trying to block common ports for security reasons.

Block Sites
 (Not What You Need):

Block Sites
 generally allows you to block 
websites
 or 
URLs
, not services or specific ports. You would typically use this if you want to prevent access to certain websites by their domain names (e.g., 
example.com
).

While 
block sites
 can be useful for parental controls or restricting access to certain content, it doesnât work for blocking specific 
network services
 like FTP or RDP.

How to Block Services on Netgear Nighthawk Router:

Log into the Router
:

Open a web browser and go to the router's IP (usually 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
).

Enter the 
username
 and 
password
.

Navigate to Advanced Settings
:

After logging in, click on the 
"Advanced"
 tab.

Find the "Security" or "Block Services" Section
:

Look for 
"Security"
 or 
"Blocked Services"
 under 
Advanced Settings
.

You may need to click on 
"Firewall"
, 
"Content Filtering"
, or 
"Access Control"
 to find these settings.

Add a Block for Each Service
:

For FTP (Port 21)
: Enter 
21
 in the 
port field
 and select 
"Block"
.

For Telnet (Port 23)
: Enter 
23
 and block it.

For RDP (Port 3389)
: Enter 
3389
 and block it.

Add each port (or service) you want to block.

Apply Changes
:

Save or 
apply the settings
 once you've blocked the necessary ports.

Restart Your Router (Optional)
:

It might be a good idea to 
restart the router
 to ensure the changes are applied correctly.

Summary
:

Block Services
 is the option you should use to block specific network services like FTP, Telnet, and RDP.

Block Sites
 is used for blocking access to websites, not for blocking ports or network services.
