Yes, you're correct! 
"Block Sites"
 on your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
 is more of a 
content filter
. It allows you to block 
websites
 based on their 
domain names
 or 
keywords
 (e.g., blocking any site containing "gambling" or "socialmedia" in the URL).

It is not used to block 
network services
 or 
ports
 like FTP, Telnet, or RDP. Instead, it's meant to restrict access to specific 
websites
 or 
categories
 of content.

Hereâs a quick breakdown:

Block Sites (Content Filter)
:

Purpose
: Blocks access to specific 
websites
 based on 
URLs
 or 
keywords
.

Use Cases
:

Restrict access to websites (e.g., social media, adult content, or gaming sites).

Block access to specific domains (e.g., 
example.com
).

How it works
: The router uses a list of 
URL patterns
 or 
keywords
 to block access. This is typically used for 
parental controls
 or 
network usage control
 but not for blocking services like FTP or RDP.

Block Services (Firewall / Port Blocking)
:

Purpose
: Blocks access to specific 
network services
 or 
ports
 used by various applications and protocols.

Use Cases
:

Block services like 
FTP
, 
Telnet
, 
RDP
, and other ports commonly used by hackers to access or control systems.

Restrict access to certain types of traffic or applications (e.g., blocking Remote Desktop or file sharing protocols).

Summary
:

Block Sites
 = 
Website filtering
 based on domains or keywords.

Block Services
 = 
Port filtering
 to restrict network services and protocols.

For your goal of securing your network by blocking ports like 
FTP (21)
, 
Telnet (23)
, 
RDP (3389)
, etc., you would need to use the 
Block Services
 feature (or something similar, depending on your routerâs specific settings).

Let me know if you need further guidance on setting this up! ð

Yes, 
Access Control
 on your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
 is 
device-specific
. It allows you to 
block or allow specific devices
 (like computers, phones, or tablets) from accessing your network based on their 
MAC address
. This is a great feature for controlling which devices can connect to your network, but it is 
not the same as blocking network services
 like FTP or RDP.

What is Access Control?

Access Control
 enables you to create a 
list of allowed or blocked devices
 on your network.

It works by filtering devices based on their 
MAC address
 (a unique identifier for each network device).

It is 
useful for limiting which devices can access your network
, but it does 
not control which ports or services are available on your network
.

How Does Access Control Work?

Allow or Block Devices
:

You can set up rules that 
allow only certain devices
 (based on MAC address) to access your network. For example, you might allow your 
laptop and smartphone
, but block your 
neighborâs device
.

Device-Specific Access
:

This setting doesnât block services or ports but controls which devices can 
connect to your router
 in the first place.

When to Use Access Control?

If you want to 
restrict access to your network
 to only trusted devices, 
Access Control
 is very useful.

Example
: You could block any unknown devices from connecting to your Wi-Fi network by only allowing devices you specifically add to the list.

Itâs not typically used to block specific services or ports like FTP, RDP, or Telnet.

How to Use Access Control to Block Devices on Your Netgear Nighthawk Router
:

Log into Your Router
:

Open a browser and go to 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
 to access your router settings.

Log in using your 
username
 and 
password
.

Navigate to Access Control Settings
:

Under the 
"Advanced"
 tab, look for 
"Security"
 or 
"Access Control"
.

You should see an option like 
"Access Control"
 or 
"Device Access List"
.

Add Devices to Allow or Block
:

Here, you can 
allow or block
 devices by entering their 
MAC addresses
.

Youâll typically see a list of 
connected devices
