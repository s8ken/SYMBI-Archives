Summary
:

Access Control
 is 
device-specific
 and is used for managing 
which devices can connect to your network
. Itâs a great way to 
block unauthorized devices
.

For blocking specific 
ports or services
 like 
FTP (21)
 or 
RDP (3389)
, youâll need to use the 
Port Forwarding/Port Filtering
 or 
Block Services
 options.

If you'd like help setting up 
Access Control
 to allow/block specific devices or need help with 
port filtering

Hereâs a list of commonly used 
TCP ports
 that you may want to consider blocking for security:

Commonly Blocked TCP Ports:

Port 21 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
:

Used for transferring files between a server and a client. Often targeted by attackers if not secured.

Port 23 - Telnet
:

Used for remote command-line access to a server or device. It is unencrypted and should be blocked unless absolutely necessary.

Port 25 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
:

Used for sending email. If you're not running your own mail server, blocking this port can prevent spammers from using your network.

Port 53 - DNS (Domain Name System)
:

This port is used for resolving domain names to IP addresses. Typically, you donât need to block this unless you have specific security concerns.

Port 80 - HTTP
:

Used for standard web traffic. If you're not running a web server on your local network, you may choose to block it, though this can interfere with most browsing.

Port 110 - POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)
:

Used for retrieving email from a mail server. If you're not using this protocol for email, you can block it.

Port 143 - IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
:

Used for accessing email from a server. Block if you're not using IMAP.

Port 443 - HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
:

Used for secure web traffic (encrypted). This port is typically open by default because itâs necessary for most secure web browsing.

Port 3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
:

Used for accessing Windows machines remotely. This port is often targeted for brute force attacks, so it's advisable to block if you're not using remote desktop.

Port 445 - SMB (Server Message Block)
:

Used for file sharing on Windows. Blocking this can protect your network from SMB-related vulnerabilities and attacks.

Port 5900 - VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
:

Used for remote access to graphical desktops. If youâre not using VNC, block it to prevent unauthorized access.

Port 6660-6669 - IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
:

Used for chat services. Block if you're not using IRC servers.

Port 8080 - HTTP Alternate (often used by proxies and caches)
:

Used for web traffic but often associated with 
proxies
 and 
unauthorized services
. If not needed, block it.

Port 8443 - HTTPS Alternative
:

Sometimes used for web traffic on alternate secure ports. Block it if you're not running any services on that port.

Additional Notes:

Ports 80 and 443
 are 
necessary for web browsing
, so avoid blocking them unless you have a very specific reason to do so.

You can block 
Port 3389 (RDP)
 if you donât use 
Remote Desktop
 or similar services to access other devices remotely.

Port 445 (SMB)
 should be blocked if you're not using Windows file sharing, as it's often targeted by malware and exploits.

Blocking 
Port 25 (SMTP)
 can prevent malicious users from sending spam through your network.

By selectively blocking these ports, you can reduce your networkâs vulnerability to external attacks and intrusions.
