es) to 
automatically configure your network
 to open ports without requiring you to manually configure port forwarding. Itâs often used by applications like 
online gaming
 or 
video conferencing
.

Pros and Cons of UPnP:

Pros of Keeping UPnP On
:

Convenience
: It allows devices and applications to automatically configure port forwarding when needed, which can be especially useful for 
gaming consoles
 and some 
smart home devices
.

Easy Setup
: You donât have to manually open ports for certain applications.

Cons of Keeping UPnP On
:

Security Risks
: 
Malicious applications or attackers
 can exploit UPnP to open ports on your router, which can expose your network to unauthorized access.

Increased Attack Surface
: If a device or application is compromised, it may automatically open ports for hackers to gain access.

When Should You Turn UPnP Off?

Security Concerns
: If you're concerned about 
security
, especially with ongoing attacks or keyloggers, it's recommended to 
turn UPnP off
.

You Don't Need it
: If you donât need to automatically open ports for specific devices or applications (e.g., you don't play online games that require automatic port forwarding), then 
turning UPnP off
 is safer.

How to Disable UPnP on Your Router
:

Log into your routerâs web interface
 (usually at 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
).

Go to the Advanced settings
 tab or 
Advanced Setup
 section.

Look for UPnP
 in the settings. It might be under 
"Advanced Settings"
, 
"Security"
, or 
"Network"
 settings.

Disable UPnP
.

Save
 the settings and 
restart
 your router if necessary.

Recommendation
:

Turn UPnP off
 if you're focused on security and don't need automatic port forwarding.

If you rely on it for devices that need port forwarding (like gaming consoles), you can leave it on, but be cautious.

under access control netgear recommend turning it on a blocking all new devices from connecting and then specifying which device you want to connect but I ave noticed with more modern apple equipment that the Mac address changes to protect them how do I manage this?

You're absolutely right! With modern Apple devices, such as iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, 
Apple has introduced a feature
 that 
randomizes the MAC address
 when connecting to Wi-Fi networks to 
protect user privacy
. This means that the 
MAC address
 that appears to the router can change, making it difficult to rely solely on MAC address filtering for 
device access control
.

Managing Device Access with MAC Address Randomization:

1. Disable MAC Address Randomization (If Needed)

You can 
disable the MAC address randomization
 feature for your Apple devices. This ensures that the 
same MAC address
 is used each time the device connects to a Wi-Fi network, making it compatible with 
MAC address filtering
.

Here's how to disable 
MAC address randomization
:

For iPhone/iPad
:

Go to 
Settings
 > 
Wi-Fi
.

Tap the 
i
 icon next to the connected network.

Toggle off 
Private Address
 (this option randomizes the MAC address).

Once disabled, the device will use its 
real MAC address
 when connecting to this specific Wi-Fi network.

For MacBook
:

Open 
System Preferences
 > 
Network
 > 
Wi-Fi
.

Click on the 
Advanced
 button and locate the network you're connecting to.

Disable 
Private Address
 (if available), which will stop randomization for that network.

2. Use DHCP Reservation (Static IP Address)
:

Another way to manage device access is by using 
DHCP Reservation
. Even if the MAC address changes, the router can assign a 
static IP address
 to your device based on its MAC address. This way, your device will always receive the same IP address, even if the MAC address randomization feature is on.

Hereâs how to set up 
DHCP reservation
 on a Netgear Nighthawk router:

Log into the Router
: Go to 
192.168.1.1
 or 
192.168.0.1
 and log in.
