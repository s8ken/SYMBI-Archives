AN Setup
 or 
DHCP Settings
.

Enable DHCP Reservation
:

Find the 
"LAN Setup"
 or 
"DHCP Reservation"
 tab.

Add your device by entering its 
current MAC address
 and 
desired IP address
 (you can find the MAC address of the device in the Wi-Fi network settings on the device).

Apply and Save
: This will ensure that your device always gets the same IP address based on its MAC address, even if itâs randomized.

3. Manually Add Devices to Access Control
:

With 
Access Control
, after enabling MAC address filtering, you can still manually add devices by specifying their 
MAC addresses
 (even if randomized). The router may ask you to 
add devices by MAC address
, but youâll need to update this when you see that the MAC address changes due to randomization.

Summary
:

Disable MAC address randomization
 on your Apple devices if you want to use 
MAC address filtering
 on your router.

Alternatively, use 
DHCP reservation
 to assign a 
static IP address
 to your devices, even if their MAC address changes.

Access Control
 can still be effective for managing which devices can access your network, but you may need to adjust for the MAC address randomization behavior.

if its fixed its fine yes it won't change?

ChatGPT said:

Yes, if you 
disable MAC address randomization
 on your Apple devices, the MAC address will be 
fixed
 and will 
no longer change
. This means that the device will always use the same MAC address when connecting to your Wi-Fi network, making it compatible with 
MAC address filtering
 on your router.

So, once you turn off 
MAC address randomization
, you can reliably 
block or allow specific devices
 using 
Access Control
 or 
MAC address filtering
 based on that fixed MAC address.

Summary
:

If MAC address randomization is disabled
, the MAC address 
won't change
, and you can safely use MAC address filtering to control access.

You can 
manually add the fixed MAC address
 to your router's 
Access Control
 or 
MAC filtering
 settings.

No need to worry about MAC addresses changing
 if randomization is turned off.

If you're ready to disable it on your Apple devices, follow the steps mentioned earlier, and feel free to let me know if you need help with that process! ð

in my Mac wireless settings I have off, fixed and rotating

ChatGPT said:

In your 
Macâs wireless settings
, the options for 
MAC address randomization
 are as follows:

Off
:

No MAC address randomization
. The device will always use its 
true, fixed MAC address
 when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. This is the option you want to choose if you want a 
consistent MAC address
 for 
MAC address filtering
 or 
Access Control
 on your router.

Fixed
:

The device uses a fixed MAC address
, but the address remains 
consistent across all networks
. This is similar to the 
"Off"
 setting in that it ensures the MAC address doesn't change, but it can still be a 
non-standard
 MAC address (not the one assigned by the manufacturer).

Best for privacy
 if you want a consistent address that isn't your 
real MAC address
, but still doesnât change across networks.

Rotating
:

MAC address randomization is enabled
. Your device will 
use a different MAC address
 each time it connects to a new Wi-Fi network. This is meant to 
enhance privacy
 by making it harder to track the device across networks. However, it can interfere with 
MAC address filtering
 and 
Access Control
 on your router since the address changes frequently.

Recommendation for your case
:

If you want to ensure that 
Access Control
 or 
MAC address filtering
 works properly and 
devices don't change their MAC address
, you should 
choose "Fixed"
 or 
"Off"
.

"Off"
 is the best option if you want to use your 
real, manufacturer-assigned MAC address
 for filtering and don't need the privacy benefits of randomization.

"Fixed"
 will still allow you to have a 
consistent,
