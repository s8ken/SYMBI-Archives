 non-random MAC address
 that doesn't change, but it's not the manufacturer-assigned one.

To Disable MAC Randomization Completely:

Select "Off"
 if you want the device to use its 
true MAC address
.

If 
privacy is a concern
 but you still need the MAC address to stay fixed, 
select "Fixed"
.

Let me know if you need help selecting or understanding these options! ð

ok and does my devices IP address stay the same?

The 
IP address
 of your device will 
not necessarily stay the same
 unless you configure it to do so. This is independent of whether you're using 
MAC address randomization
 or a 
fixed MAC address
.

How IP Addresses Are Assigned:

Dynamic IP (DHCP)
: By default, most devices on a network are assigned 
dynamic IP addresses
. This means the router assigns a different IP address to your device each time it connects to the network (within a specified range, called the DHCP pool).

The 
IP address may change
 over time, especially after a 
reboot
 or 
reconnection
.

Static IP
: If you want to ensure that your device always has the same IP address, you can set a 
static IP address
.

You can either set this manually on your 
device
 or use your 
routerâs DHCP reservation
 feature to always assign the same IP to a specific device based on its 
MAC address
.

How to Ensure a Fixed IP Address:

Using DHCP Reservation (Router-side)
:

You can configure your 
router
 to always assign the same IP address to your device based on its 
MAC address
. This method allows you to have a 
consistent IP address
 without manually setting it on your device.

Manually Set Static IP (Device-side)
:

You can also configure your 
MacBook
 or other devices to always use the same IP by setting a 
static IP address
 in the 
Network settings
.

Open 
System Preferences
 > 
Network
.

Select 
Wi-Fi
 (or Ethernet, depending on your connection).

Click 
Advanced
 and go to the 
TCP/IP
 tab.

Set 
Configure IPv4
 to 
Manually
.

Enter the 
IP address
 you want to assign to your device.

Enter your 
routerâs gateway IP
 (usually something like 
192.168.1.1
).

Enter your 
DNS server addresses
 (you can use Google's 
8.8.8.8
 and 
8.8.4.4
, or your router's DNS).

Summary
:

If you donât set up a 
static IP
, your device will be assigned a 
dynamic IP
 each time it connects to the network, and this IP may change.

You can ensure your device always uses the same IP by either:

Setting a static IP on your device
.

Using 
DHCP reservation
 on your router, where the router assigns the same IP to your device based on its 
MAC address
.

To configure 
DHCP settings
 on your 
Netgear Nighthawk router
, hereâs a step-by-step guide:

How to Configure DHCP Settings on a Netgear Nighthawk Router:

Log in to the Router
:

Open a web browser and type the router's IP address (usually 

192.168.1.1

 or 

192.168.0.1

) in the address bar.

Log in with your 
admin credentials
 (the default username is usually 

admin

, and the default password is 

password

 unless you've changed it).

Navigate to DHCP Settings
:

Once logged in, go to the 
Advanced
 tab in the menu.

Then, click on 
Advanced Setup
.

Look for 
LAN Setup
 or 
DHCP Settings
 (this can vary slightly depending on the router model).

Configure the DHCP Range
:

In the 
DHCP Settings
 section, you can set the 
DHCP Range
 (the range of IP addresses the router will assign to devices on your network).

For example, if your router's IP address is 
192.168.1.1
, you might set the DHCP range to 
192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.100
. This means that the router will assign IP addresses in this range to connected devices.

Set Static IP Reservation
 (Optional but recommended for specific devices):

If you want to assign a 
static IP
 to a specific device based on its 
MAC address
, go to the 
DHCP Reservation
 or 
Static IP Reservation
 section.
