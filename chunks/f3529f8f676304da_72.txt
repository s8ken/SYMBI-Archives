s important to be aware of various potential security concerns that could indicate unauthorized access, misconfigurations, or other suspicious activities. Here are some common 
red flags
 and concerns you should look for in your router logs:

1. Unrecognized Devices Connecting to Your Network

Concern
: Unauthorized or unrecognized devices connecting to your Wi-Fi network.

What to Look For
: Check for devices that shouldnât be on your network. These might have unfamiliar device names, MAC addresses, or IP addresses.

Action
: If you notice any unauthorized devices, immediately block or disconnect them via the 
Access Control
 or 
MAC address filtering
 options.

2. Failed Login Attempts

Concern
: Multiple 
failed login attempts
 to your routerâs administrative interface, indicating a potential brute force attack.

What to Look For
: Look for 
repeated failed login attempts
 or abnormal login patterns (e.g., too many failed login attempts in a short time).

Action
: Ensure you have a 
strong, unique password
 for your routerâs admin interface. If you're using default credentials, change them immediately. You might also consider enabling 
two-factor authentication
 for your router if available.

3. Port Scanning or Unexpected Incoming Traffic

Concern
: 
Port scanning
 or unexpected incoming traffic could indicate someone is probing your router for open ports to exploit.

What to Look For
: Look for 
suspicious external IP addresses
 or unknown connections attempting to reach open ports. Check if there are any connections from unrecognized external IPs or foreign countries.

Action
: You can block suspicious IPs, disable 
UPnP
, and ensure you 
close unnecessary ports
. Enable 
firewall settings
 on your router to block any unauthorized incoming traffic.

4. DNS Changes

Concern
: 
DNS hijacking
 or redirection, where your DNS settings are changed to point to a malicious server, potentially redirecting your internet traffic to harmful websites.

What to Look For
: Check for changes to your 
DNS settings
 that you didnât make, or attempts to redirect DNS queries to unfamiliar IP addresses (e.g., IPs not from your ISP or DNS provider).

Action
: Reset your DNS settings to your desired server (e.g., Google DNS: 
8.8.8.8
 / 
8.8.4.4
 or Cloudflare DNS: 
1.1.1.1
). Regularly monitor your DNS settings.

5. Unusual Outbound Traffic

Concern
: 
Outbound traffic spikes
 or connections to unfamiliar external IP addresses could indicate malware or other malicious activity on your network.

What to Look For
: Monitor for 
outbound connections
 to strange or unexpected IPs, particularly if they involve high volumes of traffic.

Action
: Investigate which device is making this connection. If necessary, isolate the device and perform a thorough security check (scan for malware or viruses).

6. UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) Changes

Concern
: UPnP allows devices on your network to automatically open ports. However, this can be exploited by malware to create security vulnerabilities.

What to Look For
: Look for 
unexpected UPnP changes
 in the logs, especially if new ports are being forwarded to your network.

Action
: Disable 
UPnP
 on your router unless you specifically need it. If UPnP is enabled and you see strange port forwarding activity, immediately disable it and change any related security settings.

7. Repeated DHCP Requests

Concern
: 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
 requests from unknown devices could indicate someone trying to 
access your network
 by spoofing a MAC address.

What to Look For
: Repeated DHCP requests with 
new IPs
 being assigned or devices that arenât recognized as part of your network.

Action
: Use 
static IP assignment
 or 
DHCP reservation
 for known devices. Ensure youâre using 
MAC address filtering
 or 
Access Control
 to limit device access to your network.

8. Remote Management Access

Concern
: 
Remote management
 should be disabled if you donât need it. If someone gains acce
