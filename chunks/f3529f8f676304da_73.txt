VPN access
 or 
SSH with key-based authentication
.

Set up a guest network
 for visitors to limit access to your main network.

Use a firewall
 on your router to block suspicious traffic.

Regularly check logs
 for any suspicious activity and adjust security settings accordingly.

Conclusion

While routers are generally designed to be secure, 
vulnerabilities can still exist
, and 
attacks can happen
 if you donât stay vigilant. Regularly reviewing the logs, 
disabling unused features
, and 
setting strong passwords
 are essential for securing your router and network. Let me know if you need more assistance with reviewing or securing your router logs! ð
