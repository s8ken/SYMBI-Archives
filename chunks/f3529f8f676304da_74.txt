Based on the log entries you provided, here are some key observations and potential concerns:

1. Multiple Device Connections (DHCP IP Assignments)

Observation
: Devices with MAC addresses 
76:2F:37:97:A2:31
 and 
8E:42:E7:85:20:CD
 are being assigned IP addresses by the router at various times, indicating they are connecting to the network.

Concern
: If these devices are 
unknown
, this could indicate unauthorized devices attempting to access your network. In this case, review the 
MAC addresses
 to ensure that they belong to your devices.

Action
: If you notice unknown devices, block them via 
Access Control
 or 
MAC address filtering
.

2. Admin Logins from Local Network

Observation
: There are 
admin login events
 from local devices (e.g., 
192.168.1.2
 and 
192.168.1.3
).

Concern
: Unauthorized access to your routerâs 
admin panel
 can be a serious security risk. If these IPs are not devices you recognize, it could indicate someone is attempting to gain control over your router.

Action
: Make sure the 
admin password
 is strong and not easily guessable. If possible, enable 
two-factor authentication
 for accessing the router settings. If you suspect unauthorized access, change your 
admin credentials
 immediately.

3. WLAN Access Rejected due to Incorrect Security

Observation
: There are several instances where devices (with MAC address 
76:2F:37:97:A2:31
 and 
8E:42:E7:85:20:CD
) attempted to access your network but were 
rejected due to incorrect security
.

Concern
: These rejected access attempts could indicate 
malicious attempts
 to access your Wi-Fi network using incorrect credentials or a security misconfiguration (e.g., a mismatch between the network's WPA2 password and the attempted connection).

Action
: Ensure your 
Wi-Fi password
 is strong, using WPA2 or WPA3 encryption. If the attempts are from devices you don't recognize, 
block them
 from accessing your network.

4. Internet Connectivity Changes

Observation
: Your router logs show 
internet connection drops
 and 
reconnections
 at various times.

Concern
: While these can be normal due to network interruptions, repeated drops or reconnections may indicate potential issues with the router, network interference, or even an attempt to disrupt your internet connectivity.

Action
: Ensure your router firmware is up to date, and check for any network interference or unauthorized access attempts.

Key Actions to Take
:

Change the Admin Password
: If you see any suspicious admin login attempts, change the password to something complex and difficult to guess.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication
 (if possible) for the admin login to add an extra layer of security.

Check Device MAC Addresses
: Ensure all devices listed in the logs are yours. If you notice anything unfamiliar, block those devices from accessing your network using the 
Access Control
 feature.

Use Strong Wi-Fi Security
: Make sure your 
Wi-Fi network
 uses 
WPA2
 or 
WPA3
 encryption, and choose a strong password. Disable older protocols like WEP, as they are insecure.

Review Router Firmware
: Ensure the router firmware is 
up to date
 to patch any potential vulnerabilities.

Monitor for Further Suspicious Activity
: Continue to monitor your logs for unusual activities or changes that may indicate an attempt to exploit or access your router.

Conclusion
:

The logs suggest that there may be unauthorized devices or connection attempts on your network. The first step is t
