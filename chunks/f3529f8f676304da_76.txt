2. How to Use These Lists in LuLu

Once you've downloaded one of the above lists (most of them come in 
hosts file
 format), hereâs how you can integrate them into 
LuLu
 for better security:

Download the blocklist
:

You can choose one or more of the lists mentioned above, and download the 
.txt
 or 
.hosts
 file.

Format the file (if necessary)
:

Make sure the file is formatted correctly for LuLu. In most cases, the hosts file should work well, but you may need to remove any unnecessary lines or comments if the file is too large.

Import the file into LuLu
:

Open 
LuLu
 and navigate to 
Preferences
 or 
Advanced Settings
.

Look for an option to add custom blocklists or outbound/inbound rules.

Upload the downloaded file and enable filtering.

Monitor and adjust
:

Once the blocklist is active, 
LuLu
 will start blocking outbound connections to the malicious IPs and domains in the list.

You can monitor the LuLu logs to check for any blocked connections.

3. Additional Blocking Options:

Firewall Settings
: You can also configure 
firewall settings
 on your router to block incoming and outgoing connections to these IPs.

Router-Level DNS Filtering
: You can use the lists on your router to block unwanted domains at the DNS level, which can be an additional layer of protection for all devices connected to your network.

Important Notes
:

Regular Updates
: These blocklists need to be updated regularly to stay current with new malicious IPs and domains. Many of the sources listed above (like Steven Black) provide regular updates.

Performance Impact
: Adding large blocklists to LuLu or your router can affect performance, especially on low-end devices. You may want to start with smaller, curated blocklists.

Let me know if you need further help downloading, formatting, or configuring these blocklists in LuLu or your router. ð
