How to Use These Files:

Once you've downloaded the appropriate file, hereâs what you need to do:

For LuLu
:

Download one of the files mentioned above (e.g., 
hosts
 or 
.txt
 file).

LuLu
 allows you to add custom blocklists. Check LuLuâs 
preferences
 or 
advanced settings
 for an option to import custom blocklists (e.g., a 
hosts
 or 
.txt
 file).

For Router (DNS Filtering)
:

If you prefer to block domains at the router level, look for 
DNS filtering
 settings on your Netgear router.

Import the downloaded blocklists or use the router's DNS filtering options to block domains listed in the file.

Hosts File
:

If you prefer, you can also manually add these domains to your systemâs hosts file (
/etc/hosts
 on macOS or Linux), which would block access to those domains system-wide.

What You Should Look For
:

For Blocking Malicious IPs and Domains
: The lists youâre interested in will typically have malicious domains and IPs written in plain text, either in a 
hosts file
 or 
.txt format
. LuLu will use these to block outgoing connections, and your router can use them for DNS filtering.

The two files you provided contain blocklists for phishing and general ad/spyware/host blocking. Here's how you can use them to enhance your system's security:

Phishing Filter Hosts
: This list can be used to block phishing sites by redirecting their domain names to a local address (usually 
0.0.0.0
).

General Hosts Blocklist
: This list contains known domains that are involved in advertising, spyware, and other malicious activities.

To use these files with tools like LuLu (to block inbound and outbound traffic), you would typically copy these lists into your firewall/monitoring tool's settings or configure your system's 
/etc/hosts
 file or similar network security configurations. Here's how to set this up:

Steps for LuLu (Outbound & Inbound Monitoring)

Download the list
: Open and save these files to your computer.

Import into Firewall
: If you're using a firewall tool like LuLu or a similar solution, you can:

For LuLu
: You may need to manually add these domain entries to the "Block" list in LuLu, or use the 
hosts
 file method described above to redirect these domains locally.

System Setup
:

Edit 
/etc/hosts
 to include all the lines from the blocklists (
0.0.0.0 <blocked domains>
). This will stop your system from accessing those domains.

Firewall Configuration
:

If using LuLu or another firewall, ensure that the firewall rules are set to monitor outgoing connections. Add these hosts to the blocklists if LuLu supports this functionality.

General Usage in 
/etc/hosts
:

Open the terminal and edit the hosts file with root per
