 blocklists.

Here's how you can proceed:

Steps to Add a Custom Blocklist Using the "Lists" Tab in LuLu
:

Open LuLu
:

Launch 
LuLu
 from the 
Applications
 folder or via Spotlight.

Go to Preferences
:

Click on 
LuLu
 in the top menu bar and select 
Preferences
, or press 
Cmd + ,
.

Navigate to the "Lists" Tab
:

In the Preferences window, go to the 
Lists
 tab.

Add Your Blocklist
:

In the 
Lists
 tab, there should be an option to 
add a custom list
 or 
import a list
.

Click on "Add"
 or 
"Import"
 (depending on the version), then select the 
blocklist
 file you downloaded (for example, 
phishing-filter-hosts.txt
 or 
hosts.txt
).

Apply the Blocklist
:

Once added, LuLu will start using this list to monitor outgoing and incoming connections to the domains in the blocklist.

Ensure that LuLu is set to 
block outbound connections
 to these domains or IP addresses. It will alert you when an app tries to access one of the domains in the list.

Check LuLu Logs
:

You can view the logs in LuLu to monitor any blocked connections or alerts triggered by these blocklists.

If You Don't See Import Option:

If there's no explicit 
import option
:

You can manually copy and paste the domains into LuLuâs 
blocklist section
 under the 
Rules
 tab.

Thanks for the clarification! It looks like LuLu's 
Lists
 tab is asking for a specific format, which might be different from the plain 
.txt
 files you have. Usually, LuLu expects blocklist files to be in a 
proper format
 (like a specific text format with domain names or IPs) that it can directly read.

Hereâs what you can do to get the blocklists to work properly in LuLu:

Steps to Convert and Import the Blocklist in the Correct Format
:

Format the Blocklist File
:

LuLu is likely looking for a 
list of domains or IP addresses
. You can take the 
.txt
 files you've downloaded and extract the relevant domains or IPs.

Hereâs how you can convert the 
.txt
 files into a format LuLu can use:

For each line in your 
.txt
 file
 (e.g., 
phishing-filter-hosts.txt
 or 
hosts.txt
), you should have one domain or IP address on each line, like this:

Copy

0.0.0.0 example.com
0.0.0.0 anotherexample.com
0.0.0.0 maliciousdomain.com

If the file contains other data (like IP addresses), make sure itâs in a format where each entry is on a new line, and the 
domains are prepended with 
0.0.0.0

.

Create a New Blocklist File
:

Open a new 
.txt
 file (e.g., 
luLu_blocklist.txt
) and copy-paste the domains from the blocklist into the file, using the format shown above.

Example
:

Copy

0.0.0.0 example.com
0.0.0.0 ads.example.com
0.0.0.0 phishingdomain.com

Import the New Blocklist into LuLu
:

Go back to 
LuLu's Preferences
 > 
Lists
 tab.

Select "Block List"
, and then browse to select the newly formatted file (
luLu_blocklist.txt
).

Apply
 it and LuLu should now start blocking any outbound or inbound connection to those domains.

Check LuLu Logs
:

Once applied, LuLu will notify you if any application tries to connect to the domains on the blocklist.

Alternative Manual Method
:

If LuLu still does not recognize the 
.txt
 file, you can manually add these domains to the blocklist section:

Copy the domain names from the 
.txt
 file.

Manually add them into the 
Block List
 section in LuLu under the 
Lists
 tab, one per line, in the required format.
