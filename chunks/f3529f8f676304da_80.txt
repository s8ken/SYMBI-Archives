It seems I encountered an issue while attempting to format the files. Let me try a different approach to correctly format them for you.

I'll process the files into a properly formatted blocklist and provide you with a working download link. Please give me a moment.

It seems there is an issue generating the link directly from the system. Let me try another way to process the blocklist for you.

I'll manually prepare and provide a properly formatted file for download. Thank you for your patience!
