It seems I'm facing an issue generating the download link directly. However, you can easily format the files manually or use a script on your system to do it.

Hereâs how you can manually format the lists:

Open your 
.txt
 files
 (e.g., 
phishing-filter-hosts.txt
, 
hosts.txt
, etc.).

Format each domain
 by prepending 
0.0.0.0
 to each domain like so:

Copy

0.0.0.0 example.com
0.0.0.0 phishingdomain.com
0.0.0.0 maliciouswebsite.com

Save the new file
 (e.g., 
luLu_blocklist.txt
).

Import
 this file into LuLu by following the steps in the 
Lists
 tab, selecting the newly formatted blocklist file.

Would you like further help with formatting your lists or any other part of the process? Let me know!

how do I prepend in bulk?

ChatGPT said:

To prepend 
0.0.0.0
 to each domain in bulk, you can use a simple script to process the list of domains and output them in the correct format.

Hereâs how you can do it in Terminal on macOS
:

Open Terminal
.

Navigate to the directory
 where your text file is located, using 
cd
. For example:

bash

Copy

cd

 /path/to/your/file

Run the following command
 to prepend 
0.0.0.0
 to every domain in the file:

bash

Copy

sed 

's/^/0.0.0.0 /'

 input.txt > formatted_output.txt

input.txt
 is your original file with the domain names.

formatted_output.txt
 is the new file that will have 
0.0.0.0
 prepended to each domain.

Check the output file
 (
formatted_output.txt
) to ensure the domains are formatted as 
0.0.0.0 example.com
.

Alternative using a Python script
:

If you prefer, hereâs a simple Python script to prepend 
0.0.0.0
 to all domains:

Open a 
text editor
 and copy the following script into a new file (
prepend.py
):

python

Copy

# Open your input file

input_file = 

"input.txt"

output_file = 

"formatted_output.txt"

# Open and read the input file

with

open

(input_file, 

"r"

) 

as

 infile:
    lines = infile.readlines()

# Write the formatted lines to the output file

with

open

(output_file, 

"w"

) 

as

 outfile:

for

 line 

in

 lines:

# Prepend '0.0.0.0 ' to each line

        outfile.write(

"0.0.0.0 "

 + line.strip() + 

"\n"

)

print

(

f"File formatted successfully! Saved as 
{output_file}

")

Save
 the script and run it via Terminal:

bash

Copy

python3 prepend.py

Check the output
 (
formatted_output.txt
), and it should now have the correct formatting.

Let me know if you need further help with any of these methods! ð

it saved as .py.rtf

ChatGPT said:

It looks like the file was saved in the wrong format (RTF instead of a Python script). Here's how you can fix it:

Steps to Save the Python Script Correctly
:

Open your Text Editor
 (TextEdit, Sublime, VS Code, etc.).

Create a New File
.

Copy the Python Script
 (from the previous response) into the new file.

Save the File
:

Save the file with the 

.py
 extension
 (for example, 
prepend.py
).

In 
TextEdit
 (if you're using it), be sure to select 
Plain Text
 mode by going to 
Format
 > 
Make Plain Text
 before saving.

Run the Script
 in Terminal:

Open Terminal.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the 
.py
 file.

Run the script using:

bash

Copy

python3 prepend.py

After running the script, it will generate the formatted output as 
formatted_output.txt
 in the same directory.

If you encounter any issues with this, let me know, and I'll guide you further!
