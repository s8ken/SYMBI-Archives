 extension, open Terminal.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run:

Great! Here's how you can save the file correctly in 
TextEdit
:

Steps to Save the Python Script in TextEdit
:

Open TextEdit
.

Go to the 
Format
 menu and select 
Make Plain Text
. This ensures youâre working with plain text instead of rich text (RTF).

Copy and Paste the Python Script
:

Copy the Python script I provided earlier and paste it into TextEdit.

Save the Script as a 
.py
 File
:

Go to 
File
 > 
Save
.

In the 
Save As
 field, type 
prepend.py
 (make sure to include the 
.py
 extension).

For the 
Where
 option, choose the folder where you want to save the script.

At the bottom, where it says 
If no extension is provided, use .txt
, 
do not check this option
.

Click 
Save
.

Verify the File
:

Make sure the file is saved with a 
.py
 extension and 
not
 as 
.txt
 or 
.rtf
.

You should now have a file named 
prepend.py
.

Run the Script
:

Open 
Terminal
.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the 
prepend.py
 file.

bash

Copy

cd

 /path/to/your/file

Run the script using:

bash

Copy

python3 prepend.py

This should work now! Let me know if you encounter any issues while saving or running the script.

You said:

ok is there a reason I can't see it in the folder?

ChatGPT said:

If you're not seeing the 
.py
 file in the folder, it might be due to a couple of reasons. Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

1. Hidden File Extensions in macOS:

Sometimes macOS hides file extensions by default. This could be why you're not seeing the 
.py
 extension.

To make file extensions visible:

Open 
Finder
.

Go to the 
Finder
 menu and select 
Preferences
.

In the 
Advanced
 tab, check the box next to 
Show all filename extensions
.

Now, you should be able to see the 
.py
 file extension in the folder.

2. The File Might Have Been Saved with a 
.txt
 Extension:

TextEdit
 may still try to save it as a 
.txt
 file even though you specified 
.py
.

To check and fix this:

In Finder
, find the file, and check if it has 
.txt
 at the end.

If it's named 
prepend.py.txt
, just rename the file:

Right-click the file and select 
Rename
.

Change the name to 
prepend.py
 (without 
.txt
).

Press 
Enter
 to confirm the name change.

3. File Is Not Saved Properly:

If you accidentally saved the file incorrectly, TextEdit may not have saved the 
.py
 extension properly.

To fix this:

Open 
TextEdit
 again.

Open the file where you pasted the Python script.

Save it again, but this time ensure that the 
Save As
 field is typed correctly with 
.py
 (for example, 
prepend.py
).

Make sure you select 
Make Plain Text
 under the 
Format
 menu before saving.

4. Check If It's in the Correct Folder:

Ensure you're looking in the correct folder. If you're using the 
Save As
 option in TextEdit, make sure the location is the one you intended (for example, Desktop or a specific folder).

After performing these checks, you should be able to see the 
.py
 file in the folder. Try opening Terminal again, navigating to the folder, and running it as mentioned earlier.

Let me know if you're still facing issues!
