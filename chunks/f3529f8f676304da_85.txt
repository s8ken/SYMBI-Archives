the last things I'll be doing is to downgrade me to a standard user and add the admin account and complex password

That sounds like a great final step to enhance your system's security. Here's a quick guide on how to do it:

1. Create a New Admin Account (if you don't have one already)
:

Go to 
System Preferences
 > 
Users & Groups
.

Click the 
lock icon
 in the bottom left and enter your admin password.

Click the 
"+"
 button to create a new user.

Set the 
New Account
 type to 
Administrator
.

Set a 
strong password
 for this new account.

2. Change Your Current Account to Standard
:

In 
Users & Groups
, select your current account.

Click the 
lock icon
 again and enter the password.

Under 
Account Type
, change it from 
Admin
 to 
Standard
.

3. Set a Strong Password for the New Admin Account
:

Ensure your new admin account has a complex, strong password.

Ideally, use a 
password manager
 to store the password securely.

4. Log Out of the Admin Account
:

After setting up the new admin account, log out of your current account and log in to the 
new admin account
.

5. Test Your Setup
:

Ensure that you can perform admin tasks when logged into the new admin account.

Log into your standard account and confirm that you are restricted from making admin changes.

This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your admin privileges, as they will be separated into another account with a complex password.
