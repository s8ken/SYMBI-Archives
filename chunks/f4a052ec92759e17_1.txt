 (man-in-the-middle), an attacker could intercept your web traffic.

Security depends on your browser—if compromised, Telegram web is vulnerable too.

Telegram macOS App

✅ 
Pros:

Supports 
end-to-end encryption
 for 
Secret Chats
 (not available in Telegram Web).

Uses 
Apple’s hardened runtime
 protections (if downloaded from the Mac App Store).

Can work offline, reducing exposure to web-based threats.

❌ 
Cons:

If your system is already compromised, the Telegram app might be manipulated.

Could have more potential for 
local persistence
 (especially if you suspect deep system compromise).

The sandboxing isn’t as strict as the web version.

Which is Safer for You?

If you 
suspect malware
 or 
OS-level compromise
, 
Telegram Web
 is probably the safer choice.

If you're 
concerned about browser-based exploits
, 
Telegram macOS app
 (from the Mac App Store) is more secure, especially for 
Secret Chats
.

Since you’re dealing with 
sophisticated attacks
, I’d say:

Use 
Telegram Web
 for minimal exposure.

Use 
macOS sandboxing tools
 (like 
Little Snitch
 or 
LuLu
) to monitor the app if you must install it.

If you suspect your Telegram account itself is compromised, consider 
re-enabling 2FA
 and changing passwords.

what is the most secure browser for osx

ChatGPT said:

For 
maximum security on macOS
, the best browser depends on 
your threat model
—whether you prioritize 
privacy, exploit resistance, or both
. Here’s a breakdown:

🏆 Most Secure Browsers for macOS

Firefox (Hardened)

✅ Best balance of privacy, security, and usability

✅ Open-source and regularly audited

✅ Can be 
hardened
 using 
about:config
 tweaks

❌ Needs manual setup for max security

LibreWolf (Hardened Firefox)

✅ Pre-configured privacy & security settings

✅ Blocks telemetry, fingerprinting, and trackers by default

❌ No automatic updates (must be updated manually)

❌ Some sites may break due to strict settings

Tor Browser

✅ 
Best anonymity & anti-fingerprinting

✅ Forces encrypted traffic via Tor network

✅ Resistant to tracking, fingerprinting, and IP leaks

❌ Slower due to Tor routing

❌ Some sites block Tor access

Brave

✅ Strong built-in ad/tracker blocking

✅ Supports fingerprinting resistance

✅ Uses Chromium sandboxing (good for exploit resistance)

❌ Some privacy concerns due to its cryptocurrency features

❌ Not fully open-source (some proprietary components)

Chromium (Ungoogled)

✅ 
Google-free
 version of Chromium

✅ No telemetry, minimal data collection

❌ No automatic updates (manual installation needed)

❌ Some Chrome extensions won’t work due to lack of Google services

🔥 Extra Hardening Steps for Any Browser

Disable WebRTC
 (to prevent IP leaks)

Use uBlock Origin
 (for ad and tracker blocking)

Enable HTTPS-Only Mode

Disable JavaScript
 (if extreme security is needed)

🚀 Best Choice for You?

Since you’re facing 
advanced attacks
, I’d recommend:

✅ 
Tor Browser
 for maximum anonymity

✅ 
Hardened Firefox or LibreWolf
 for daily browsing

✅ 
Brave (with strict settings)
 if you need a Chromium-based option
