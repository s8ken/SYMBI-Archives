Explanation:

Application Support/CleverFiles
 → Stores recovery-related files.

Caches/com.cleverfiles.*
 → Temporary cache files.

Logs/CleverFiles
 → Log files.

Preferences/com.cleverfiles.*
 → Configuration files.

4️⃣ Check for Background Services

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

launchctl list | grep cleverfiles

If you see any entries, unload and remove them:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo launchctl remove com.cleverfiles.DiskDrill
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cleverfiles.*
sudo 

rm

 -rf /Library/LaunchAgents/com.cleverfiles.*

5️⃣ Verify No Remnants Remain

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

find / -iname 

'*diskdrill*'

 -o -iname 

'*cleverfiles*'

 2>/dev/null

This scans the entire system for any remaining Disk Drill files.

6️⃣ Reboot Your Mac

Restart your system to ensure everything is cleared.

7️⃣ Check for Any Persistence

If you want to double-check that Disk Drill is truly gone, run:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i 

"disk drill\|cleverfiles"

If anything still appears, let me know, and we’ll go deeper. 🚀🔍

system-level commands
 that require

🚀 Fix: Gain Temporary Admin Access to Remove Disk Drill

Since you 
need admin privileges
 to fully remove Disk Drill, follow these steps:

🔹 Option 1: Try Running Without Sudo

If you don’t have 
sudo
 access, try running the commands 
without

sudo
:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/CleverFiles

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.cleverfiles.*

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Logs/CleverFiles

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.cleverfiles.*

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.cleverfiles.*

If this works, it will remove most of Disk Drill’s files from your user space.

🔹 Option 2: Log in as an Admin User

Go to:

Apple menu
  → 
System Settings
 → 
Users & Groups
.

Check if you have access to an 
Administrator account
.

If you do, 
log into the Admin account
 and run the original 
sudo
 commands.

🔹 Option 3: Enable Your Account for Sudo Access (If You Have Admin Credentials)

Log into an Admin account
.

Open 
Terminal
 and type:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership lcl

This grants 
lcl

admin privileges
.

Restart your Mac.

Try the removal commands again with 
sudo

.

🔹 Option 4: Boot into macOS Recovery Mode

If you 
can’t access an Admin account
, you can still remove Disk Drill by using 
macOS Recovery Mode
:

Restart your Mac
 and hold 
⌘ + R
 until you see the Apple logo.

Open 
Utilities → Terminal
.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Application\ Support/CleverFiles

rm

 -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Extensions/DiskDrill.kext

Restart and check if Disk Drill is gone.

Let me know if you’re blocked at any step!
