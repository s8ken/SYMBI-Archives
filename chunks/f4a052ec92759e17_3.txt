You successfully removed most of the 
user-level
 Disk Drill files. Now, we need to check if 
system-wide files
 still exist. Since you don’t have 
sudo
 privileges, we’ll take an alternative approach.

🚀 Step 1: Check if Disk Drill is Completely Removed

Run the following command to scan for remaining files:

bash

Copy

Edit

find / -iname 

'*diskdrill*'

 -o -iname 

'*cleverfiles*'

 2>/dev/null

This will 
search the entire system
 for leftover files related to Disk Drill.

🛑 Step 2: If You See Any Remaining Files

If the command finds files in 
/Library or /System
, but you can't delete them due to permission issues, you have three options:

🔹 Option 1: Delete System Files from Recovery Mode

Restart your Mac
 and hold 
⌘ + R
 until the Apple logo appears.

When the macOS Utilities window appears, select 
Utilities → Terminal
.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Application\ Support/CleverFiles

rm

 -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Extensions/DiskDrill.kext

rm

 -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cleverfiles.*

rm

 -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cleverfiles.*

Restart your Mac
 normally.

🔹 Option 2: Reinstall macOS (If You Suspect Deep Persistence)

If Disk Drill 
still appears after a reboot
 and you can’t delete system files, you may need to 
wipe your Mac and reinstall macOS
 from scratch.

🛠️ Step 3: Confirm Disk Drill is Gone

After rebooting, check for any remaining traces:

bash

Copy

Edit

ps aux | grep -i 

"disk drill\|cleverfiles"

If nothing shows up, 
Disk Drill is fully removed!
 🚀🎯

find
 command shows, and I’ll guide you through any remaining cleanup! 🔍

How to Allow LibreWolf to Run on macOS

Since macOS 
blocks non-App Store apps by default
, you’ll need to manually allow 
LibreWolf
 to run.

🚀 Step 1: Try Opening LibreWolf

Download LibreWolf
 from 
the official site

.

Move it to 
Applications
 (
/Applications/LibreWolf.app
).

Try to open it
 by 
double-clicking
.

If you see a warning saying 
"LibreWolf cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"
, move to the next step.

🔓 Step 2: Bypass macOS Security (Gatekeeper)

Go to:


 Apple Menu → 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll down to 
Security
 and look for:

"LibreWolf was blocked because it is not from the App Store"
.

Click 
"Open Anyway"
.

Try launching 
LibreWolf
 again.

🔧 Step 3: Manually Allow Using Terminal (If Needed)

If LibreWolf 
still won’t open
, manually remove the quarantine flag:

Open 
Terminal
 and enter:

bash

Copy

Edit

xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LibreWolf.app

Then try launching LibreWolf again.

🛠️ Step 4: (If Still Blocked) Disable Gatekeeper Temporarily

If macOS 
still refuses to open it
, try this:

Open 
Terminal
 and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo spctl --master-disable

Enter your 
admin password
.

Open 
LibreWolf
.

Once it’s running, re-enable security:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo spctl --master-enable

🛡️ Step 5: Verify LibreWolf Runs Securely

Open LibreWolf and go to 
Preferences → Privacy & Security
.

Enable 
HTTPS-Only Mode
 for extra protection.

Check 
about:support
 to ensure LibreWolf is running in a 
sandboxed
 environment.

You should now be good to go! 🚀 Let me know if you hit any issues.
