er
 is blocking it from running normally. Let’s manually allow it to run.

🚀 Step 1: Verify LibreWolf Signature

Run this command in Terminal:

bash

Copy

Edit

codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Applications/LibreWolf.app

If you see 
“not signed”
, it means LibreWolf is unsigned, but we can still allow it.

🔓 Step 2: Allow LibreWolf with Gatekeeper

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LibreWolf.app
sudo spctl --add --label 

"LibreWolf"

 /Applications/LibreWolf.app
sudo spctl --

enable

 --label 

"LibreWolf"

This tells macOS to allow LibreWolf even though it’s unsigned.

🛠 Step 3: Manually Sign LibreWolf (Optional)

If macOS 
still refuses to open LibreWolf
, manually sign it:

bash

Copy

Edit

codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/LibreWolf.app

Then try launching it again.

🔥 Step 4: Verify & Open LibreWolf

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll down to 
Security
 and look for:

"LibreWolf was blocked because it is from an unidentified developer"
.

Click 
"Open Anyway"
.

Try opening LibreWolf again.

📌 Step 5: Verify Extensions (uBlock)

The files listed:

swift

Copy

Edit

/System/

Volumes

/Data/

Users

/lcl/

Library

/Application Support/

librewolf

/Profiles/

c3shxrvv.default

-

default

/extensions/

uBlock0

@raymondhill

.net.xpi

/System/

Volumes

/Data/

private

/var/

folders

/b7/

jn17zrs14m51hnxdrk74_xqw0000gn

/T/

tmp

-

7qp.xpi

are related to 
uBlock Origin
. These are normal LibreWolf extensions, but if you suspect tampering, you can remove them:

bash

Copy

Edit

rm

 -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/librewolf/Profiles/*/extensions/*

This resets all LibreWolf extensions.

Now, 
try running LibreWolf again
 and let me know if it works! 🚀💻

Since your account (
lcl
) 
does not have sudo privileges
, you won’t be able to use 
sudo
 to allow LibreWolf. But we can 
bypass macOS security without sudo
 using alternative methods.

🚀 Option 1: Allow LibreWolf Without Sudo

Try running the following command 
without sudo
:

bash

Copy

Edit

xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LibreWolf.app

Then, 
try opening LibreWolf
 normally.

🔓 Option 2: Open LibreWolf via Finder

Go to 
Finder
 → 
Applications
.

Right-click

LibreWolf.app
 → 
Open
.

macOS will show a warning → Click 
"Open Anyway"
.

🛠 Option 3: Move LibreWolf to Another Location

Move 
LibreWolf.app
 from 
Applications
 to your 
Desktop
.

Run:

bash

Copy

Edit

xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Desktop/LibreWolf.app

Move it 
back to Applications
 and try opening it.

🛡 Option 4: Enable "Allow Apps from Anywhere" (No Sudo)

Since you don’t have sudo access, we can manually allow all apps:

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Privacy & Security
.

Scroll down to 
Security
 and look for:

"LibreWolf was blocked because it is from an unidentified developer"
.

Click 
"Open Anyway"
.

Try opening LibreWolf again.

🔍 Option 5: Create a New Admin Account

If you 
don’t have sudo access
 but need it for future fixes:

Log into 
an existing Admin account
.

Open 
System Settings
 → 
Users & Groups
.

Click 
Add User
 → Create a new 
Admin account
.

Log in with this Admin account and run:

bash

Copy

Edit

sudo dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership lcl

Restart your Mac. Now 
lcl
 will have 
sudo privileges
.

Let me know 
which step works for you
! 🚀 If you’re blocked at any point, we’ll adjust the approach.
