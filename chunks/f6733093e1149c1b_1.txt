: All tokens were regenerated either from known user agents (browser, axios, Python) or recognized platforms.

Account used consistently
: All actions are from the user

Scopes
: Most scopes were not explicitly listed, suggesting limited access or that the export redacts them. Where shown, access was limited to reading basic user data.

Refreshed access
 to integrations with Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, Together.ai, Vercel, Cerebras, and a smart auditing tool.

Most actions appear

, involving SDKs or scripts renewing tokens automatically.

No evidence
 of third-party access or misuse.
