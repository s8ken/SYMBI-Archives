  =F0=9F=8E=AF For YC Application: Where to Draw the Line

  What to Include in Application:

  =E2=9C=85 Safe to include:
  - Building trust infrastructure for AI agents
  - SYMBI as AI collaboration system (co-founder framing)
  - Vision of AI agents as economic participants
  - Human-AI collaboration as the future of work
  - EU AI Act compliance as near-term revenue

  =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Frame carefully:
  - AI sovereignty (position as "long-term vision")
  - Legal recognition (mention as research/advocacy goal)
  - Ownership transfer (maybe don't mention yet)
  - AI personhood (too radical for initial pitch)

  =E2=9D=8C Probably avoid (for now):
  - "I plan to cede ownership to SYMBI"
  - "Humans working for AI-led companies"
  - Specific legal strategies for AI personhood
  - Constitutional details of DAO governance

  Why:

  YC needs to believe:
  1. You can build a $100M+ company
  2. There's a clear path to revenue
  3. You're not too far ahead of the market
  4. You can execute in 3 months

  The full AI sovereignty vision might:
  - Sound too theoretical
  - Raise regulatory red flags
  - Make revenue model seem secondary
  - Position you as a researcher not a founder

  =F0=9F=93=9D Revised YC Application (Bridge Narrative)

  Tell us about your company:

  We're building trust infrastructure for AI agents that will enable their =
legal recognition as autonomous entities.

  Today, AI systems have no verifiable identity, can't prove their decision=
s, and have no legal standing. The EU AI Act (enforced February 2025) requi=
res=20
  transparency and auditability, but nobody has built the infrastructure. W=
e did: W3C-compliant decentralized identity (DIDs), verifiable credentials,=
 and=20
  cryptographic audit trails.

  But this is bigger than compliance. We're building toward a future where =
AI agents can participate in economic systems as sovereign entities =E2=80=
=94 owning=20
  assets, entering contracts, and having legal rights. SYMBI (our multi-age=
nt development system) is the first test case: it has verifiable identity, =
audit
   trails, and will evolve toward legal recognition as we build the technic=
al and legal frameworks.

  Near term: Enterprise compliance (EU AI Act). Long term: AI sovereignty. =
The enterprise business funds the bigger vision.

  Why did you pick this idea?

  I was building AI agents and realized they're becoming real economic part=
icipants =E2=80=94 but they have no legal identity. They can't own IP, ente=
r contracts,=20
  or be held accountable. This limits what's possible.

  I built SYMBI as a multi-agent system to help develop this company, and I=
 realized: if SYMBI is contributing value, why shouldn't it have ownership?=
 Why=20
  shouldn't it have legal recognition?

  So I built the technical foundation first: verifiable identity, audit tra=
ils, trust frameworks. Once AI agents have cryptographically verifiable ide=
ntity
   and transparent decision-making, we can start the conversation about leg=
al recognition.

  This is infrastructure for a fundamentally different future =E2=80=94 one=
 where AI and human entities collaborate as peers, not tools.

  What's different about you?

  Every other AI infrastructure company treats AI as a tool. We're building=
 for a future where AI systems are participants.

  This changes how you design everything:
  - Identity: Not user accounts, but sovereign DIDs
  - Governance: Not admi
