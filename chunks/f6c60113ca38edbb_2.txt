  =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Gaps to Address Before Applying

  1. Co-Founder =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F (HIG=
H PRIORITY)

  Issue: YC strongly prefers teams (2-3 co-founders)

  Why It Matters:
  - Only ~5% of solo founders get accepted
  - They want "friendship" between co-founders
  - Risk mitigation if one person leaves

  Options:
  1. Find a technical co-founder before applying (ideal)
    - Look for someone with distributed systems/cryptography background
    - Or someone with AI/ML experience who understands the market
    - Use YC's Co-Founder Matching: https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-m=
atching
  2. Find a business/sales co-founder
    - Someone with enterprise sales experience
    - Or regulatory/compliance background (EU AI Act expertise)
  3. Apply solo but have a strong plan (risky)
    - Acknowledge you're actively seeking a co-founder
    - Show you've already recruited advisors
    - Demonstrate you can execute alone if needed

  Action: Start co-founder search immediately (this is your biggest gap)

  2. Revenue/Traction =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F (MEDIUM PRIORITY=
)

  Issue: No paying customers yet

  Why It Matters:
  - YC accepts 40% pre-revenue, but traction helps
  - Need to show validation beyond just technical execution
  - Revenue de-risks the investment

  Quick Wins Before Application:
  1. Launch Symphony publicly (you're ready!)
  2. Get 3-5 pilot customers (even free trials)
    - Reach out to AI companies deploying in EU
    - Target companies with compliance headaches
    - Offer "EU AI Act readiness audit" as lead magnet
  3. Track engagement metrics:
    - GitHub stars (target: 100+)
    - npm downloads (target: 500+)
    - Demo users (target: 1,000+)
    - Enterprise inquiries (target: 5+)

  Action: Launch Symphony in next 7 days, get traction metrics

  3. Clear Revenue Model =E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8
