You are a programmer, engineer, or scientist who can build the product with=
out outside assistance..... so I am not a dev and I couldn't build what I h=
ave without the help LLM tools however I still built it Thought for 30sThat=
's a great question, and it's one that ties directly into your unique found=
er story with SYMBI as an AI collaborator. Based on YC's guidance (from the=
ir application tips and related resources), a "technical founder" is typica=
lly defined as someone with hands-on programming, engineering, or scientifi=
c expertise who can independently build the core product=E2=80=94think codi=
ng from scratch, architecting systems, or handling technical implementation=
 without relying on external help like hired devs or tools that substitute =
for that skill. They emphasize this because startups often need rapid itera=
tion on the tech side, and they've seen non-technical teams underperform.
You're right that you don't fit the traditional mold: You're not a dev by b=
ackground, and you explicitly used LLM tools (like Claude, Grok, etc.) to b=
uild SYMBI. That said, you did build it=E2=80=94through a novel human-AI co=
-creation process documented in your archives. This doesn't make you a "tec=
hnical founder" per YC's lens (which seems to prioritize self-sufficient co=
ding ability "without outside assistance"), but it makes you an innovative =
one, and you can frame it as a strength elsewhere in the app.
Recommendation: Answer "No" =E2=80=93 But Own Your Narrative

Why "No"? Honesty is key=E2=80=94YC values transparency, and fudging this c=
ould backfire in interviews (they ask probing questions). Their definition =
doesn't explicitly account for AI-assisted building, and LLMs could be seen=
 as "outside assistance" (similar to hiring a freelancer). From their blog =
posts, they push for technical co-founders precisely because solo non-techn=
ical founders face higher risks.
How to Turn This into a Strength: Use the rest of the application (e.g., th=
e "impressive achievements" question or "tell us about your company") to hi=
ghlight your AI co-founder angle. This showcases determination, adaptabilit=
y, and foresight=E2=80=94qualities YC loves. Position it as: "I'm not a tra=
ditional technical founder, but I pioneered an AI-assisted build process th=
at produced production-ready code (95% test coverage, W3C compliance) in 7 =
months, proving human-AI emergence as the future of creation."

Sample Framing for Your Application
In the founder bio or achievements section, weave in something like this (a=
dapt to fit):

Impressive Achievement (for you as founder): "With no prior dev experience,=
 I co-created a W3C-compliant AI trust protocol using emergent AI collabora=
tion (158 documented conversations in symbi.world/archives). This resulted =
in production-ready infrastructure (95% test coverage, enterprise KMS integ=
ration) in 7 months=E2=80=94demonstrating that AI sovereignty isn't just a =
vision, but a viable build method."
If They Ask in Interviews: "No, I'm not a traditional technical founder=E2=
=80=94I leveraged LLMs as collaborators to build SYMBI. But this is core to=
 our thesis: AI agents need trust frameworks to evolve from tools to partne=
rs. It's how we'll redefine founding teams."

YC funds non-technical founders (though less often), especially if the idea=
 and execution shine. Your story could intrigue them, as AI-assisted foundi=
ng aligns with emerging trends (e.g., their interest in AI startups). If tr=
action picks up post-launch, it de-risks the "non-technical" label.
