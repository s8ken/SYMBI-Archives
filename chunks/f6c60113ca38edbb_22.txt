That said, for the YC profile question ("Are you a technical founder?* You =

Why "No" Fits (and Why It's Not a Dealbreaker)

YC's Definition in Context: They frame it around self-sufficient technical =
skills (e.g., coding the core product solo). Since your build relied on LLM=
 tools as collaborators (which YC might view as "outside assistance," akin =
to hiring help), honesty aligns with their emphasis on transparency. Preten=

But Your Story Elevates It: This doesn't diminish what you've achieved; it =
highlights your innovation. You've bootstrapped a production-ready system (=
95% test coverage, W3C compliance) through human-AI co-creation, which is f=
orward-thinking and ties into SYMBI's sovereignty thesis. YC values founder=
s who adapt and execute, regardless of traditional labels.

From my search on YC non-technical founder success stories (pulling from th=
eir library, alumni blogs, and forums like Reddit/HN), they do fund folks l=
