1. Start with YC's Co-Founder Matching (Primary Channel)
This is your best bet for high-quality, aligned matches=E2=80=94it's free, =
YC-vetted, and designed for unconventional missions like yours. Over 100K m=
atches have been made, with active profiles in AI hubs (e.g., 3,200 in SF, =
1,900 in Bangalore). Successful examples include impact-focused teams like =

Process (Updated for 2025):

Create a profile at ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching: Share your backgrou=

nces (e.g., "tech co-founder with distributed systems/crypto experience pas=

mmitment required.
The matching engine suggests profiles based on YC's team success data (e.g.=

Invite to connect; if accepted, chat (virtual or at in-person meetups in SF=
