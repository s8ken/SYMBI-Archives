  =F0=9F=93=9D Draft Application Angles

  One-Liner (for YC application):

  "W3C-compliant trust infrastructure for AI agents. We help companies comp=
ly with the EU AI Act through decentralized identity, verifiable credential=
s,=20
  and cryptographic audit trails."

  Problem Statement:

  "The EU AI Act requires transparency and auditability for high-risk AI sy=
stems. Companies deploying AI agents have no standard way to prove identity=
,=20
  audit decisions, or demonstrate compliance. We built the first W3C-compli=
ant trust protocol specifically for AI agents."

  Why Now:

  "EU AI Act enforcement begins February 2025. Every company with AI in the=
 EU needs compliance infrastructure. We're the only production-ready soluti=
on=20
  built on open standards."

  Traction to Highlight:

  - Built in 7 months by solo founder with AI-assisted development
  - 95% test coverage, 313+ test files
  - Working demo with multi-provider AI comparison
  - W3C standards compliant (DID Core, VC Data Model, Status List 2021)
  - Open source (MIT) with enterprise model (Yseeku)
  - [Add pilot customers once you have them]
  - [Add GitHub stars/npm downloads once launched]

  What You'll Do in YC:

  1. Validate product-market fit with 10+ paying enterprise customers
  2. Build co-founder relationship (if found before batch)
  3. Refine pricing based on customer conversations
  4. Prepare for Series A ($2M+ raise post-Demo Day)
