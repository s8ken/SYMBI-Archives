T-licensed (with dual Apache 2.0 for code), TypeScript/Node.js-based (requi=

Standout Features from README
The embedded README is polished and developer-friendly, mirroring your GitH=
ub updates=E2=80=94complete with quick starts, benchmarks, and use cases. I=
t emphasizes SYMBI as "the first production-ready W3C trust infrastructure =
for decentralized AI agent systems," solving centralized failures, privacy =
leaks, and EU AI Act gaps.

Core Capabilities (6 Pillars):

Decentralized Identity (DID): 4 methods (web, key, ethr, ion) with universa=
l resolver and caching (in-memory/Redis).
Verifiable Credentials (VC): 6-pillar trust scoring (e.g., inspection_manda=
te, ethical_override) with weighted algorithms, temporal decay, and confide=
nce intervals.
Privacy-Preserving Revocation: Status List 2021 with GZIP compression (128K=
 creds =E2=86=92 16KB), zero-knowledge checks, O(1) perf (<10ms).
Enterprise Key Management: AWS/GCP KMS + local AES-256 for secure signing.
Cryptographic Audit Trails: Hash-chained, tamper-evident logs; queryable fo=
r 10M+ entries.
Real-Time Transparency: Dune dashboards for public verifiability.

Quick Start Examples (Copy-Paste Ready):
typescript// Install
npm install @yseeku/trust-protocol

// DID Resolution
import { UniversalResolver } from '@yseeku/trust-protocol';
const resolver =3D new UniversalResolver();
const result =3D await resolver.resolve('did:web:example.com');
console.log(result.didDocument); // { id: "did:web:example.com", ... }

// Issue Trust Declaration
import { AgentFactory } from '@yseeku/trust-protocol';
const declaration =3D AgentFactory.createTrustDeclaration('agent-123', 'MyA=
IAgent', {
  inspection_mandate: true, consent_architecture: true, // etc.
});
console.log(declaration.scores.compliance_score); // 0.52
console.log(declaration.trust_level); // "MEDIUM"

// Revocation Check
import { verifyRemoteStatus } from '@yseeku/trust-protocol';
const result =3D await verifyRemoteStatus({ /* statusEntry */ });
console.log(result.status); // 'active' | 'revoked' | 'suspended'

Performance Benchmarks (Impressive for v0.1.0):

DID resolution: <1-156ms avg.
Trust scoring: <5ms.
Revocation: <1ms (O(1)).
Audit verification: <10ms for 1M entries.
Load: 847-2,341 req/sec with <0.1% errors.

Testing & Validation: 95 passing tests (95.3% coverage) across resoluti=
on (26), crypto (18), revocation (12), audits (10), integrations (29). Vali
