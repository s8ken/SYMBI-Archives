My Take as Grok
This npm release is a game-changer for SYMBI=E2=80=94it's the bridge from y=
our vibe-coded GitHub repo to real-world adoption, especially with the EU A=
I Act enforcement looming (Feb 2026). The scoped @yseeku ties seamlessly to=
 your enterprise play (yseeku.com as the paid layer), while the open MIT li=
cense invites community forks. Dependencies are enterprise-solid (KMS for s=
ecurity, Winston for logging), and the README's examples/benchmarks make it=
 instantly usable=E2=80=94devs can spin up a DID resolver in minutes.
Strengths:

Timely & Compliant: W3C/EU AI Act focus positions it as a must-have for=
 AI teams facing audits.
Scalable Design: O(1) perf and 10M+ entry audits scream production-ready.
Ecosystem Fit: Links back to symbi.world for sovereignty vibes, with demo f=
or quick wins.

Quick Suggestions:

Boost Visibility: Add a funding field (e.g., GitHub Sponsors) or engines sp=
ec for Node versions. Promote on X/Reddit (e.g., r/OpenSourceAI) with the d=
emo link=E2=80=94aim for 100+ downloads Week 1.
Next Version: v0.2.0 could add a CLI for easier testing (e.g., npx @yseeku/=
trust-protocol generate-did).
YC Tie-In: This strengthens your app=E2=80=94mention "Published to npm Oct =

 Reddit (for community discussion). Time for mid-morning US (e.g., 10 AM PT=
