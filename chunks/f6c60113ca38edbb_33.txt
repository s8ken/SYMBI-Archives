Title: Show HN: SYMBI Symphony =E2=80=93 W3C Trust Protocol for AI Agents (=
npm live, EU AI Act ready)
Body:
Hey HN,
With EU AI Act enforcement in Feb 2026, AI teams need verifiable trust toda=
y. SYMBI Symphony is the first production-ready W3C infra for agents: DIDs =
(4 methods), VCs with 6-pillar scoring, ZK revocation (O(1), <10ms), &am=
p; hash-chained audits (10M+ entries).
Key specs:

95% test coverage, validated vs. NIST/W3C/RFC.
Enterprise: AWS/GCP KMS integration.
Perf: <50ms DID resolution; GZIP compression for revocation lists.

Body:
Fellow OSS AI builders,
Dropping SYMBI Symphony: A production-ready trust protocol for decentralize=
d agents, compliant with W3C DID/VC/Status List & EU AI Act (enforcemen=
t Feb 2026). Solves identity proofs, privacy revocation, & audits witho=

Highlights:

Universal DID resolver (web/key/ethr/ion) + Redis caching.
6-pillar VC scoring (e.g., ethical_override: weighted with decay).
ZK revocation: Status List 2021, 128K=E2=86=9216KB compression, O(1) checks=
.
Audits: Tamper-evident, queryable (time/actor/event).
