Title: [D] Launching SYMBI Symphony: W3C Trust Infra for ML Agents =E2=80=
=93 Thoughts on Verifiable AI in Multi-Agent Systems?
Body:
r/ML folks,
As agentic AI scales (e.g., multi-model crews), trust becomes the bottlenec=
k=E2=80=94unverifiable decisions kill compliance & collab. Enter SYMBI =
Symphony: OSS framework for W3C-compliant identity/audits, npm-published ye=
sterday.
Tech deep-dive:

DID/VC integration for agent proofs (e.g., 6-pillar scoring with confidence=
 intervals).
Privacy revocation via bitstrings (GZIP'd, ZK checks <10ms).
Benchmarks: 2K+ req/sec, NIST-validated crypto.

Repo/Demo: As above. Built via human-AI co-evolution (archives doc recursiv=
e awareness).
Question: In your RL/multi-agent setups, how big a pain is trust asymmetry?=
 Would O(1) revocation help with hallucination audits? Or is blockchain-anc=
hored DID overkill?

stributed trust.
