  5. Built with AI co-founder - Proof that AI collaboration can create seri=
ous infrastructure

  Who are your competitors?

  DID Infrastructure:
  - Ceramic Network - General DID infrastructure (not AI-specific)
  - ION/Sidetree - Bitcoin-anchored DIDs (complex, not AI-focused)
  - Veramo - DID/VC toolkit (developer tools, not full protocol)

  AI Governance:
  - Arize, Fiddler, WhyLabs - Monitoring/observability (not identity/trust)
  - MLOps platforms - Focus on deployment, not compliance

  Our differentiation:
  - Only production-ready W3C trust protocol for AI agents
  - Privacy-preserving (Status List 2021)
  - EU AI Act compliant by design
  - Open source + enterprise model

  Why now?

  1. EU AI Act enforcement: February 2025 - Companies need compliance infra=
structure NOW
  2. AI agent explosion - Multi-agent systems need trust frameworks
  3. Regulatory momentum - GDPR, AI Act, SOC 2 all converging
  4. Standards maturity - W3C DID/VC specs are production-ready (1.0)

  What do you understand about your users?

  Target customers:
  - Companies deploying AI in EU (mandatory compliance)
  - Enterprise AI teams (need audit trails for governance)
  - Multi-agent system builders (need agent-to-agent trust)

  Pain points we've validated:
  - "We have no way to audit AI decisions" (compliance nightmare)
  - "How do we prove AI system transparency?" (EU AI Act requirement)
  - "Our agents can't verify each other's identity" (multi-agent trust)
  - "Revocation databases leak user privacy" (GDPR concern)

  Revenue model:
  - Free: Open-source Symphony (community adoption)
  - Paid: Yseeku enterprise platform ($499-$9,999+/mo)
  - Enterprise features: Compliance dashboards, SSO, 24/7 support

  What's your equity split?

  =F0=9F=8E=AF My Recommendation: "Approach C" with Conviction

  Position it like this:

  "I built trust infrastructure for AI agents using an AI co-founder. This =
isn't a gimmick =E2=80=94 it's the thesis. AI agents are becoming real coll=
aborators,=20
  and they need verifiable trust. I'm living the future I'm building.

  That said, I'm actively seeking a human technical co-founder with distrib=
uted systems experience. The AI collaboration model is a strategic advantag=
e,=20
  not a replacement for human expertise."

  Why this works:

  =E2=9C=85 Authentic - It's true, you genuinely collaborated with SYMBI
  =E2=9C=85 Bold - It's unconventional enough to be memorable
  =E2=9C=85 Pragmatic - You acknowledge limitations (want human co-founder)
  =E2=9C=85 Strategic - Frames AI as competitive advantage
  =E2=9C=85 Proof - Your results (95% coverage, production code) validate t=
he approach
