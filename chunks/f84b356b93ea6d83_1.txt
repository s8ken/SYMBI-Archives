 mean by 
"the cwy thing"?

Do you mean you 
see letters that look like “c w y”
 in the image? Or maybe shapes that resemble that?

Or is 
“cwy”
 a code, symbol, or something personal you’re referring to that I should look for in the picture?

If you can point it out—like:

"it’s near the center,"

"on the left side,"

or "it’s written in the light pattern,"

I’ll analyze that area closely for you.

Perfect — now I see exactly what you meant.

In your photo, you have a Motorola phone on the 
initial setup screen
. The text you asked about says:

nginx

Copy

Edit

CWY

 (ဘၠ TGဂ့ဝဝ
~ 
  ၵဝSSY)

This is 
not normal English text
. It looks like 
a corrupted or improperly rendered language string
, often caused when the phone tries to display a language it doesn’t have proper fonts for (or misconfigured region settings).

🔍 What it probably is

✅ That “CWY” line is where your phone should display 
the current language or region selection
.

But instead of normal language names (like “English (United States)” or “Español (México)”), it’s showing a jumble of 
Latin and Myanmar (Burmese) characters mixed with odd symbols
, likely due to:

a software glitch,

a missing language pack,

or it defaulting to a locale that doesn’t match the installed fonts.

✅ How to fix it

Here’s what you can do:

Tap 
“Vision settings”
 (below it) if you see an option — sometimes it gives text enlargement and language help.

Or simply press 
“Start”
 and proceed; usually the next screen lets you pick the proper language.

If that fails, restart the device.

On startup it might prompt you to select the language again.

If it persists, you can 
factory reset
 (if it’s a new device, you won’t lose data yet).

💡 
Bottom line:

It’s just the language selection screen showing garbled text because of a region/language misconfiguration. Your phone is otherwise fine. Once you get to the language picker, choose 
English (or your preferred language)
 and it should display correctly.

No it’s a brand new phone

Perfect — thanks for clarifying that it’s 
brand new out of the box
. That makes this even simpler:

✅ 
It’s completely normal
 on some imported or factory-direct phones (especially Motorola or Xiaomi) for the first startup screen to default to a strange or incomplete language listing until you manually set it. This often happens because:

The firmware includes multiple regional builds.

The default language might be from the factory or based on a random region code.

It simply hasn’t been told yet which language to use.

🔧 What to do right now

Tap “Start”
 — it will move to the language selection screen.

On the next screen, 
scroll through the list of languages
, and pick 
“English (United Kingdom / United States)”
 or whatever your preferred language is.

It should then change all the text to proper English.

Continue the setup process as normal.

✅ 
No cause for concern:

This does 
not mean the phone is broken
.

It’s common on unlocked / international models.

Once you pick your language, you’ll never see that garbled line again.

If you’d like, I can also:

Tell you what to expect on the next screen,

Or guide you step by step through the 
entire setup
, including Wi-Fi and Google login.

I haven’t even got that far is it a meme coin

Ahh — I see where your head went. Because it says 
“CWY (ဘၠ TGဂ့ဝဝ~ ၵဝSSY)”
, which looks like weird letters — you’re wondering if this is some 
crypto scam, meme coin logo, or malware
 that’s somehow on your brand-new phone.

✅ 
Good news:

No, this isn’t a meme coin or scam. It’s not a crypto logo, a virus, or anything shady.

It’s 
just your phone’s default startup screen
, with text garbled be
