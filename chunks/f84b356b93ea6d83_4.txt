tied to hitting on-chain milestones. Degens will EAT that up.

🎉 The $HAUSPARTY dynamic roadmap

Here's how you could spin it:

🚀 
Stage 1:

100 SOL MC:
 We drop the first DJ set on stream.

(because even small parties need music)

💃 
Stage 2:

500 SOL MC:
 We do a live cam feed from your actual house party.

Degens see it on Twitch / YouTube / X Spaces.

“We literally threw a haus party for $HAUSPARTY.”

🎈 
Stage 3:

1,000 SOL MC:
 We hire a random clown, rent a fog machine, and make it absolute chaos.

Livestreamed. Recorded. Memed forever.

🤯 
Stage 4:

???
 The community decides. Maybe a bigger IRL event, maybe a DAO, maybe just more tequila.

🔥 How this absolutely nails meme culture

Degens 
love seeing memes become reality.

A coin called $HAUSPARTY literally funding a party?

They get to watch it unfold live on stream as the market cap grows?

That’s meme utility that’s 
actually fun
 and proves it’s not just vapor.

🪩 What I can help you do next

✅ 
Write the milestone post / roadmap.

✅ 
Design a quick hype meme
 with your milestones.

✅ 
Help draft the tweet thread
 that will go viral on degen X.

✅ Even make you a little overlay graphic for your stream that says:

Tell me your first milestone number
 (like “100 SOL MC for first stream”) and I’ll write your official hype roadmap right now.

Let’s show them how a haus party is done — on-chain. 🪩

Yeah so it’s solana to go on and then I need another wallet for the burn?

Yep — here’s exactly how that works for your $HAUSPARTY launch on Solana (via pump.fun or similar):

🪩 The quick breakdown:

1️⃣ 
Your main wallet
 (like Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)

Holds your SOL for paying fees & starting the token (about ~0.02-0.03 SOL on pump.fun).

Receives the initial minted tokens (or in pump.fun, it actually doesn’t — it uses a bonding curve so 
buyers
 mint directly from the pool).

2️⃣ 
A burn wallet

If you were launching manually (via spl-token CLI), you’d mint your supply to yourself, then burn or renounce authority.

But with 
pump.fun
 you 
don’t need to do that at all
. It automatically:

Burns the mint authority.

Locks the liquidity.

This means you (or anyone) cannot rug it, and there's 
no second wallet required
 for burns.

✅ That’s why pump.fun is so loved — it does the 
burn + LP lock for you
, so you never have to manually handle a burn wallet.

🔥 So in your case with pump.fun:

You 
only need your single Solana wallet
 (Phantom etc.) with some SOL in it.

The smart contract they deploy:

Locks the liquidity pool forever.

Burns mint authority on creation.

Starts a bonding curve automatically.

So after launch, it’s totally community-driven. You keep the party going by hyping it, streaming, and building the memes.

🚀 Bonus: if you were doing a 
manual launch

If you ever want to do it manually (like using spl-token or Solana CLI), THEN you’d:

Create the token in your main wallet.

Mint the supply.

Send some to a liquidity pool.

Then 
send the mint authority to the Solana burn address
:

Edit

11111111111111111111111111111111

That’s the universal Solana “null address” that eats it forever.

🪩 Bottom line for $HAUSPARTY on pump.fun:

✅ 
No extra wallet needed.

✅ Just fund your Phantom wallet with SOL, go to pump.fun, fill out your coin details, and you’re set.

Okay okay and vector and moonshot?

Love this energy — let’s break it down real quick.

When you say 
“vector and moonshot”
 you might be talking about either:

Name ideas / meme concepts
 for additional tokens you want to launch (like 
$VECTOR
 or 
$MOONSHOT
),

Or common degen slang:

“vector”
 = momentum, direction (sometimes even a me
