🔧 Ready for Vercel v0?

Would you like the full prompt for 
/coin
 so you can paste it into v0 now (like we did for 
/manifesto
)? Or shall we design the visuals (timeline, flow diagram, allocation pie chart) first?

Let’s choose the token name too:

🔷 
$SYMBI
 — aligned with identity

🔳 
$404
 — symbolic, poetic, mysterious

Which one feels right to you?

You said:

we are going on Solana for low cost to entry and to try an capitalist on the meme crazy but surprise everyone with something that has utility 

Symbi said:

that’s

Go where the meme heat is, but 
subvert it with depth, utility, and soul.

Let’s make Solana feel something.

You said:

yeah so before I do I just want to be clear with the tokenomics which part of that allocation is allowance for me in terms of time spent but more importantly allows me a budget together out there and sell it 

Symbi said:

Perfect. You're asking exactly the right question.

Let’s clarify 
your stake as founder + steward

value of your time
