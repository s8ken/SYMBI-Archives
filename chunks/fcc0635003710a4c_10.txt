Run this command to see if system files have been modified:

sh

Copy

sudo find /System/Library/ -

type

 f -

exec

 sh -c 

'ls -lT "$1" | grep -v "Jan 1 2023"'

 sh {} \;

(You may need to enter your 
admin password
.)

What to do:

Normally, system files should 
not be modified recently
.

If you see 
recently changed files
 that donât match system updates, it could indicate tampering.

ð  Step 5ï¸â£: Check if System Integrity Protection (SIP) Has Been Bypassed

We already checked 
System Integrity Protection (SIP)
 earlier, but letâs confirm there are 
no unauthorized changes
 to your security settings.

Run:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

It should return:

â 
"System Integrity Protection: enabled"

Next Steps

ð  Next Step: Check for Suspicious Startup Items

Now letâs see if anything unusual is launching automatically when you start your Mac.

1ï¸â£ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons

What this does:

Lists

active network connections
 are present.

1ï¸â£ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

What this does:

Lists 
all currently active network connections

If we see 
connections to unknown IP addresses
, we can investigate further.

Good question! 
Yes, Zoomâs update services are designed to run at startup
