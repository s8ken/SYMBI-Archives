ð  Step 3ï¸â£: Verify Removal

After running the delete command, check again with:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep zoom

Expected Result:
 Nothing should appear.

ð 
Try this and let me know if the file is gone!

done

ChatGPT said:

Great! ð Now, Zoomâs auto-update services are fully disabled.

ð Final Verification (Optional)

If you want to double-check, you can restart your Mac one more time and run:

sh

Copy

ls

 /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep zoom

If nothing appears, youâre all set!

Next Steps

Would you like to continue checking other security areas, or do you feel good about your system now? ð

You said:

yep all good with the zoom stuff

ChatGPT said:

Awesome! â Zoom updates are fully disabled.

Would you like to continue checking other security aspects, or are you feeling good about your Macâs overall security now? ð

You said:

yes lets say at a high level I was concerned about the system integrity and that I'm also getting warnings from say google about a lot of requests coming from my devices how would I go about getting some reporting for you to assess?

ChatGPT said:

Updated saved memory

Great question! Since youâre seeing 
Google warnings about unusual requests
, along with general 
system integrity concerns
, weâll take a structured approach.

ð Step 1ï¸â£: Check System Integrity

First, letâs confirm macOS hasnât been tampered with. Run:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

â 
Expected result:

System Integrity Protection: enabled

â If itâs disabled, thatâs a potential red flag.

ð Step 2ï¸â£: Check Network Activity for Suspicious Requests

Since Google is flagging unusual activity, we should check:

ð¡ Active Network Connections

Run:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

This shows 
active internet connections
 from your Mac.

If you see 
lots of connections to unknown IPs
, that could be suspicious.

ð¡ DNS Requests (Check for Hidden Malware)

Run:

sh

Copy

log

 show --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.network"'

 --info --last 10m

This shows recent 
network requests
 from your Mac.

If you see lots of 
unknown sites or frequent outbound traffic
, it might indicate an issue.

ð Step 3ï¸â£: Check for Unknown Processes Making Requests

Run:

sh

Copy

lsof -i -n | grep ESTABLISHED

This shows 
which apps or processes
 are making internet connections.

Look for anything 
you donât recognize
 (e.g., strange process names connecting to external servers).

ð Step 4ï¸â£: Check for Compromised Google Account

Go to

Googleâs Security Checkup

Look for:

Recent sign-ins from unknown locations

Devices you donât recognize

Unusual third-party app access

ð  Next Step: Start With Step 1 (System Integrity)

Letâs go step by step. Run:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

Tell me what it says, and weâll move to the next step! ð

You said:

enabled

ChatGPT said:

â 
Great! System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled
, which means macOS is protecting core system files from unauthorized changes. Thatâs a good sign!

ð  Step 2ï¸â£: Check Active Network Connections

Now, letâs check if your Mac has 
any unusual network connections
 that might explain the Google warnings.

Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

ð 
What This Does:

Lists all 
currently active network connections
.

If you see 
many connections to unknown IPs
, it could be suspicious.

â Expected Results:

Some normal connections to Apple, Google, or other trusted services.

Not too many unexpected or unknown IP addresses.

â If You See Many Suspicious Connections:

We can investigate further by checking which apps/processes are making those requests.

ð 
Run the command and let me know what shows up!
