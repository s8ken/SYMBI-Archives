This is your 
external (public) IP address
, which means itâs the address the internet sees when your Mac makes requests.

Letâs verify if this IP 
matches your ISP
 or if it looks unusual.

1ï¸â£ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

whois 163.47.120.68

ð 
What this does:

Looks up the 
owner of the IP address
 (should be your internet provider).

ð¨ Why This Matters:

â 
If the IP belongs to your ISP (e.g., Telstra, Comcast, BT, etc.)
, everything is normal.

â 
If it belongs to a VPN, data center, or unknown organization
, it could mean:

You're on a 
corporate or cloud-based network
.

Your traffic is being routed through 
a proxy or VPN without your knowledge
.

Someone is 
intercepting or redirecting your traffic
.

ð 
Run the 
whois
 command and let me know what it says!
