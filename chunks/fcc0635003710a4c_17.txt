 
different ISP
, then your traffic 
might be routed through an unexpected provider
.

Are You Using a VPN or Proxy?

If you donât recognize this network, check:

sh

Copy

scutil --proxy

If it returns 
proxy settings
, your traffic 
may be rerouted without your knowledge
.

Why Did Google Flag This?

If your 
IP is shared
 (e.g., multiple people/devices using it), Google might see 
suspicious traffic
 from other users.

If you 
didnât change networks but your public IP changed
, it could suggest 
a network issue, ISP rerouting, or a security concern
.

ð  Next Step: Check if Your Mac Is Using a Proxy/VPN

Run this in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

scutil --proxy

ð 
Expected Result:

If it says 
"None"
, your traffic isnât being routed through a proxy.

If thereâs a proxy 
you didnât set up
, we need to investigate further.

Run the command and let me know what it says!

ð Proxy Check Results: No Proxy Detected

â 
Your Mac is NOT using a proxy or VPN.

The output only shows 
standard exceptions
 (
*.local
, 
169.254/16
), which are normal.

No unexpected proxy settings
 are redirecting your internet traffic.

ð  What This Means for Your Google Warning

Since weâve confirmed:

â 
No proxy or VPN is in use

â 
Your IP is registered to a real ISP (Wireline B and G / Beagle Internet)

Googleâs warnings could be caused by:

A shared IP address
 â If multiple users on this ISP triggered Googleâs security systems.

Recent unusual login attempts
 â If your Google account was accessed from unexpected locations.

Temporary ISP routing changes
 â Your provider might have switched IPs dynamically.

ð  Next Step: Check Googleâs Security Alerts Directly

1ï¸â£ 
Go to

Google's Security Checkup

2ï¸â£ Look for:

Recent sign-ins from unknown locations

Devices you donât recognize

Unusual third-party app access

Check Googleâs security alerts and let me know what you find!

alright how would we check what an iPhone on the same network has been doing?

ChatGPT said:

Good question! If you want to check what an 
iPhone on the same network
 has been doing, there are a few ways to monitor its 
network activity, connections, and logs
.

ð Step 1: Check the iPhoneâs Local Network Activity

On your Mac, you can 
monitor traffic from all devices on the network
, including your iPhone.

1ï¸â£ Run a Live Network Capture

This will show 
all network requests from devices on your Wi-Fi
, including your iPhone.

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 -c 100 -nn

ð 
What this does:

Captures 
100 real-time network packets
 from all devices on your Wi-Fi.

Shows 
which external servers your iPhone is communicating with
.

â What to look for:

Apple servers (e.g., 
17.x.x.x
)
 â Normal iCloud, iMessage, App Store activity.

Google, Facebook, Amazon
 â Normal web services.

Unknown or suspicious IPs
 â Might need deeper investigation.

ð 
Run this on your Mac and look for any traffic from your iPhoneâs IP.

ð Step 2: Find Your iPhoneâs Local IP Address

To identify your iPhoneâs traffic, first find its 
local IP address
:

ð± 
On your iPhone:

Open 
Settings > Wi-Fi

Tap your 
Wi-Fi network name

Look under 
IP Address
 (should be something like 
192.168.1.X
)

ð» 
On your Mac, verify it:

sh

Copy

arp -a

This lists all devices on your network and their IPs.

Match the IP to your iPhoneâs name.

ð Step 3: Monitor Just Your iPhoneâs Traffic

Once you have your iPhoneâs 
local IP
, use this command to capture 
only
 its traffic:

sh

Copy

sudo tcpdump -i en0 host 192.168.1.X -nn

(Replace 
192.168.1.X
 with your iPhoneâs actual IP.)
