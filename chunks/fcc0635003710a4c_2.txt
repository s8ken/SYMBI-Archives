 seems suspicious (like unknown names or manufacturers).

List USB Devices with System Profiler

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

This provides a detailed breakdown of all USB devices. If anything seems unusual, let me know.

Check for HID (Human Interface Devices)

Some hardware keyloggers or rogue USB devices register as input devices. Run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOHIDSystem

If you see extra keyboard/mouse devices that shouldnât be there, it might indicate a hardware attack.

Check Kernel Extensions for USB Activity

sh

Copy

kextstat | grep -i usb

This lists active USB-related kernel extensions. If you see anything odd, it might indicate unauthorized modifications to USB behavior.

If you find any unfamiliar devices, we can look them up to see if they are suspicious. Let me know what you find! ð¨

Your output shows 
only the built-in USB controllers
 (
AppleT6000USBXHCI
), but no actual connected USB devices. This could mean:

No USB devices are currently plugged in
 â If you had devices like a keyboard, mouse, or external drive connected, they should be listed here.

A USB-based threat is 
hiding
 itself
 â Some malicious USB devices can disguise themselves or block system visibility.

System profiling may be restricted
 â Some security settings, malware, or system corruption can interfere with 
system_profiler
.

Next Steps to Investigate Further

ð 
1. Check for Hidden USB Devices

Run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l | grep -i 

"vendor"

 -B 5

This will list any USB devices with vendor details. Look for anything unusual.

ð 
2. Monitor USB Activity in Real Time

Keep Terminal open and run:

sh

Copy

log

 stream --predicate 

'subsystem == "com.apple.iokit.usb"'

 --info

Then 
plug in a known USB device
 (like a flash drive). If no logs appear, something may be blocking USB detection.

ð 
3. Check for USB HID Spoofing

Some malicious USB devices pose as keyboards/mice (keyloggers). Run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOHIDSystem -w0

If extra keyboard/mouse entries appear that you donât recognize, it may be suspicious.

ð¨ 
If You Suspect Compromise

Physically inspect your Mac's USB ports
 for anything unusual.

Check System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Extensions
 for unknown items.

Run a full malware scan
 using 
Malwarebytes
 or 
KnockKnock
.

Consider a clean macOS reinstall
 if suspicion remains high.

Let me know if you find anything unusual from these checks! ð¨

The fact that 
no USB devices
 appear in the output suggests one of the following:

There are genuinely no USB devices connected.

If you have external devices (USB drive, keyboard, mouse, etc.), but they 
do not appear
, this is suspicious.

A rootkit or malware is hiding USB activity.

Some advanced threats can block USB device enumeration to avoid detection.

USB logging or system integrity is compromised.

macOS should list even built-in USB devices (e.g., internal keyboard on MacBooks), so something may be interfering.

ð¨ Next Steps: Dig Deeper

1ï¸â£ Check if USB Devices Are Being Blocked

Try resetting the USB subsystem:

sh

Copy

sudo killall -STOP -c usbd && sudo killall -CONT -c usbd

Then rerun:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

If devices 
still donât appear
, something may be interfering.

2ï¸â£ Check for USB Driver or Hardware Issues

Run:

sh

Copy

kextstat | grep -i usb

This lists active USB-related kernel extensions. Look for anything 
unusual
 or missing.

3ï¸â£ Check for Unauthorized Processes Running

Run:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -i usb

If any unknown processes related to USB appear, it may be an issue.
