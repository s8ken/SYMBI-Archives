ð Detailed Analysis of Your iPhone Privacy Report

Your report contains 
4,863 entries
 showing app activity across different categories.

ð  Key Findings

1ï¸â£ 
Uncategorized Activity (
Unknown
 category) is the largest
 â 
2,005 entries

This means a large amount of app activity 
doesnât have clear labels
, which could indicate system processes or hidden activity.

2ï¸â£ 
High Access to Contacts & Location

Contacts accessed 1,390 times

Location accessed 572 times

Photos accessed 342 times

Camera used 252 times

Microphone used 146 times

3ï¸â£ 
Apps That Accessed Each Category the Most:

(Unfortunately, all entries are listed as 
Unknown App
âsuggesting the report didnât capture app names correctly.)

ð¨ Next Steps: Digging Deeper into the Data

Since app names are missing, letâs extract:

1ï¸â£ 
Apps making external network connections
 â Find out which apps are sending data outside your phone.

2ï¸â£ 
Apps using the microphone/camera frequently
 â See if anything is recording in the background.

3ï¸â£ 
Check timestamps for unusual patterns
 â Identify repeated access at odd hours.

ð 
Iâll now analyze external network connections from the report.
 Stay tuned!
