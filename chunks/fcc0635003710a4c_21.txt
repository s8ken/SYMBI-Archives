requent external connections
 (e.g., Safari, email, messaging apps).

If no network connections were logged
, it could mean:

The report wasnât configured to track network activity.

An app or process is preventing network activity from being logged.

Network activity logging may have been cleared before you saved the report.

ð  Next Steps: Manually Checking Network Activity on the iPhone

Since the report doesnât contain network logs, letâs check network activity 
directly from your iPhone
:

ð± 
On your iPhone:

Open 
Settings > Privacy & Security

Scroll down to 
App Privacy Report

Tap on 
Network Activity

Look for:

Apps making frequent 
background connections

Unknown domains being accessed

ð 
If you see anything unusual, take a screenshot and let me know!

ð Most Contacted Domains in Your iPhoneâs Privacy Report

Your iPhone contacted 
2,005 different domains
, with the top ones being:

ð¢ Top 5 Most Contacted Domains

1ï¸â£ 

www.google.com
 (29 times)
 â Normal Google services (Search, Gmail, etc.).

2ï¸â£ 

firebase-settings.crashlytics.com
 (29 times)
 â 
Google Firebase (App crash analytics)
.

3ï¸â£ 

firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com
 (26 times)
 â 
Google Firebase Logging (App data logging service)
.

4ï¸â£ 

fonts.gstatic.com
 (24 times)
 â Google Fonts (used by websites/apps for text rendering).

5ï¸â£ 

app-analytics-services.com
 (23 times)
 â Possible app tracking/analytics service.

ð¨ Anything Suspicious?

â 
Most domains are related to Google services, app analytics, and fonts
ânothing immediately dangerous.

â 

app-analytics-services.com

 is not a well-known domainâcould be an ad tracker or data collection service.

ð  Next Steps: Do You Want to Investigate Specific Domains?

We can 
lookup unknown domains
 (like 
app-analytics-services.com
) to see who owns them.

We can check 
which apps contacted these domains
 to see 
who is sending data where
.

Would you like to investigate any domains further?
