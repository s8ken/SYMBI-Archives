our 
iPhone Privacy Report does not list specific app names
âinstead, all Firebase and Google Login requests are grouped under 
"Unknown App"
.

ð¨ Why This Matters

We 
know
 Firebase and Google Login were accessed 
frequently
.

But since no apps are named, we 
canât confirm if Grindr or others specifically made those requests
.

This suggests 
either Appleâs privacy report failed to track app names, or something is hiding them
.

ð  Next Steps: Manually Check App Connections on iPhone

Since the Privacy Report didnât log app names, we need to check manually:

ð± 
On Your iPhone:

Go to:
 Settings â Privacy & Security â App Privacy Report.

Scroll down to "App Network Activity"

Look for apps frequently accessing:

firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com

oauth2.googleapis.com

accounts.google.com

ð 
Check if Grindr or other apps appear in the list. Let me know what you find!

ð Example of an "Unknown App" Entry

Hereâs an actual entry from your 
iPhone Privacy Report
, showing network activity that lacks clear app identification:

ð  What This Means

â 
We now have at least one app identified
 â 
com.google.ios.youtube
 (YouTube).

â 
But many other requests still donât show an app name
 â Instead, they just say 
"Unknown App"
.

ð  Next Steps

Since some app data 
is
 available (
YouTube
 appears), Iâll try to extract 
more specific app names
 from your report.

ð Identified Apps Accessing Network Services

Your 
iPhone Privacy Report successfully identified 2,005 entries with specific apps
, meaning some apps 
can
 be linked to Firebase and Google Login activity.
