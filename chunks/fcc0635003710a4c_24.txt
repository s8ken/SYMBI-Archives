ð  What This Means for Google Firebase & Login with Google

YouTube
 is directly linked to Google servicesâthis is expected.

Other apps (eToro, Reddit, Boost Mobile, DuckDuckGo)
 are also making network connections.

Grindr & similar apps were not explicitly listed
âbut may be in another part of the report.

ð  Next Steps: Look for Grindr & Related Apps

Would you like me to:

1ï¸â£ 
Check if Grindr (or similar apps) are listed at all?

2ï¸â£ 
Analyze which apps specifically contacted Firebase & Google Login?

You said:

ok so reading that I would say snapchat was the app and it accessed something called picaboo

ChatGPT said:

Not quiteâ
"Picaboo" is Snapchatâs internal bundle ID.

ð Explanation:

com.toyopagroup.picaboo

 â This is 
Snapchatâs app identifier
 (bundle ID).

aws.api.snapchat.com

 â The domain Snapchat connected to (hosted on Amazon Web Services).

"Picaboo"
 was Snapchatâs 
original name
 before it rebranded.

â 
So this entry confirms that Snapchat was making network requests.
