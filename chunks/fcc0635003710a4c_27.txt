 â Appleâs in-app purchase verification.

2ï¸â£ 
Google Apps & Services Are Active

YouTube (
com.google.ios.youtube
)
 is connected to multiple Firebase services.

Google Maps, Gmail, and Google Login services
 are also interacting with these domains.

3ï¸â£ 
Other Social & Financial Apps Are Also Active

Snapchat (
com.toyopagroup.picaboo
)
 appeared in 
Apple advertising & purchase tracking.

Reddit (
com.reddit.Reddit
)
 accessed 
Firebase & Google tracking services.

Klarna (
com.klarna.app
)
 made multiple connections to Google services.

ð¨ Why This Matters

Grindrâs presence in Firebase tracking is significant
, aligning with your concerns about Google Firebase & Login with Google.

Firebase is collecting data from multiple apps
 (not just Google-owned apps).

Ad tracking & analytics services are involved
, including 

app-analytics-services.com

, which might be a third-party tracker.

ð  Next Steps: What Would You Like to Investigate Further?

1ï¸â£ 
Dig deeper into what Grindr is sending to Firebase?

2ï¸â£ 
Investigate 
app-analytics-services.com
 to see who owns it?

3ï¸â£ 
Check if any unknown or hidden apps are using Firebase without clear identification?

ð Analysis of 2,858 Requests to "Unknown Domain"

Unfortunately, 
every single request (all 2,858) was made by "Unknown App."

ð¨ 
This means:

The 
iPhone Privacy Report did not log which apps
 made these requests.

No bundle ID, app name, or service information
 was captured for these requests.

This could indicate 
hidden system processes, background services, or obfuscated app activity.

ð  Next Steps: Investigate the Nature of These Requests

Since the report 
failed to identify apps
, letâs try other methods to detect hidden network activity:

1ï¸â£ 
Live Network Capture on Your iPhoneâs Network Activity

This will show real-time connections from all apps.

2ï¸â£ 
Check for Suspicious System-Level Services Running on the iPhone

Some unknown requests might be from background system processes or malware.

3ï¸â£ 
Investigate if Any Apps Have Special Permissions That Might Allow Hidden Requests

Some apps request extra permissions that could let them make unlogged connections.
