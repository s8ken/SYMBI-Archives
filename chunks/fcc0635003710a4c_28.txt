ð Example of an "Unknown Domain" Entry

Hereâs an actual entry where the domain is missing:

json

Copy

{

"accessCount"

:

0

,

"accessor"

:

{

"identifier"

:

"com.apple.MobileSMS"

,

"identifierType"

:

"bundleID"

}

,

"category"

:

"contacts"

,

"identifier"

:

"FDCE5030-4BE4-4B09-9C1D-198C0E0FAEB7"

,

"kind"

:

"intervalBegin"

,

"timeStamp"

:

"2025-02-22T07:59:04.531+11:00"

,

"type"

:

"access"

}

ð  What This Means

â 
Bundle ID Found:

com.apple.MobileSMS
 (Apple's iMessage/SMS app).

â 
No domain listed
 â This means the log 
does not specify where the request was sent
.

â 
Marked as "contacts" but access count is 0
 â Suggests an attempt to access contacts, but no recorded activity.

ð¨ 
This could indicate:

An unlogged network request from iMessage/SMS.

A failed or blocked request before reaching an external server.

A background system event related to messages or contacts.

ð  Next Steps

Since 
all 2,858 requests to "Unknown Domain" have no app data
, would you like to:

1ï¸â£ 
Investigate more "Unknown Domain" entries to see if patterns emerge?

2ï¸â£ 
Look for repeated timestamps to check if this activity happens at set intervals?

3ï¸â£ 
Monitor live network traffic to see if similar hidden requests are occurring?

ð 
Let me know which direction to take next!

ok so sms

ChatGPT said:

Yes, this specific example appears to be related to 
iMessage/SMS (
com.apple.MobileSMS
)
, attempting to access 
contacts
. However, since the 
access count is 0
, it suggests:

1ï¸â£ 
It didnât complete successfully
 (blocked or failed request).

2ï¸â£ 
It was a background system process
, not a user action.

ð  Next Steps: Dig Deeper into "Unknown Domain" Entries

Since we now have 
one example linked to iMessage
, we should check:

â 
Are other "Unknown Domain" entries also related to SMS/iMessage?

â 
Are there patterns (same timestamps, repeated access)?

â 
Do other system services (like iCloud, Apple ID, or Find My) appear in these logs?

ð 
Iâll now check if multiple "Unknown Domain" entries involve SMS/iMessage or other Apple services.
 Stay tuned!

ð Analysis of "Unknown Domain" Requests Related to Apple Services

A large portion of the 
2,858 "Unknown Domain" requests
 came from 
Apple system apps
 rather than third-party apps.

ð¢ Top Apple Services Involved in "Unknown Domain" Requests:

1ï¸â£ 
iMessage/SMS (
com.apple.MobileSMS
)
 â 
998 requests

This suggests 
a lot of background activity
 related to text messages.

2ï¸â£ 
Camera (
com.apple.camera
)
 â 
356 requests

Unclear why the camera would generate 
network-related requests
.
