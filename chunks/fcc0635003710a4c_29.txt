Could involve 
call logs, voicemail sync, or iCloud backup

Apple Music (

Likely syncing with 
iCloud Music Library

Photos App (

 â 
146 requests

Might indicate 
photo syncing, shared albums, or AI processing (face recognition, metadata access, etc.)
.

ð¨ Key Concern: Why Are These Requests Not Showing Domains?

Normal Apple services should be logging domains
 (e.g., iCloud, Apple servers).

The 
lack of domains could indicate encrypted or obfuscated requests
.

This may suggest 
background processes running system-wide without transparency
.

ð  Next Steps: Investigate Further?

Would you like to:

1ï¸â£ 
Analyze the timestamps to see if these requests happen at specific times?

2ï¸â£ 
Compare with normal Apple behavior to check if anything stands out?

3ï¸â£ 
Monitor live network traffic to catch these requests in real-time?

ð Comparison of "Unknown Domain" Requests vs. Normal Apple Behavior

Several 
Apple system apps
 made network requests 
without logging a domain
, which is 
not normal behavior
.

ð¨ Apple Services That Should Have Logged a Domain But Didnât:

1ï¸â£ 
iMessage/SMS (
com.apple.MobileSMS
)

â 
Expected:
 Should connect to 
Apple iMessage servers (apple.com, icloud.com)
.

â 
Issue:
 No domains were logged for 
998 requests
âmeaning messages might have been processed in a way that hides network activity.

2ï¸â£ 
Camera (
com.apple.camera
)

â 
Expected:
 Should not normally make network requests unless 
uploading photos/videos to iCloud
.

â 
Issue:

356 requests were logged without a domain
, which is unusual. If no uploads were happening, why did it generate network activity?

3ï¸â£ 
Phone App (
com.apple.mobilephone
)

â 
Expected:
 May sync call history to iCloud, but should log a connection (e.g., 
icloud.com
).

â 
Issue:

198 requests with no logged domain
âmeaning it may be transmitting data without transparency.

4ï¸â£ 
Apple Music (
com.apple.Music
)

â 
Expected:
 Should connect to 
Apple Music/iCloud Music Library
 (e.g., 
itunes.apple.com
).

â 
Issue:

152 unknown requests
âif Apple Music was 
not actively being used
, this is odd.
