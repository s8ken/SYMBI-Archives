Expected:
 Should access 
iCloud Photos
, logging requests to 
iCloud.com
.

â 
Issue:

146 requests had no domain logged
âsuggesting photo-related network activity was happening, but its destination is hidden.

ð  Key Concerns & Possible Explanations

Some of these could be normal Apple system processes
 that failed to log correctly.

If Appleâs logging was intentionally blocked (e.g., Private Relay, VPNs, or encryption), that could explain missing domains.

If you didnât use iMessage, Camera, or Music at the time, these requests are suspicious.

ð  Next Steps

Would you like to:

1ï¸â£ 
Check timestamps to see if these unknown requests happen at specific times?

2ï¸â£ 
Run a live network capture to catch similar hidden requests in real time?

3ï¸â£ 
Investigate whether a VPN, Private Relay, or security tool is blocking domain logging?

okay so what I want to do is compare the exact same report for the observations we have already made but using the iPad report attached. keeping in mind that the iPad is used about 20% of the usage time the iPhone would be at best

Updated saved memory

Got it! I'll now process the 
iPad report
 and compare it directly to the 
iPhone report
, keeping in mind:

The iPad is used about 20% as much as the iPhone
, so we expect fewer overall requests.

We will look for the same patterns we found on the iPhone
, including:

"Unknown Domain" requests

Google Firebase & Login with Google activity

Most contacted domains & which apps made those requests

Apple system services making network requests without logging a domain

Result

{'total_entries_iphone': 4863, 'total_entries_ipad': 4863}

ð Initial Comparison: iPhone vs. iPad App Privacy Reports

Surprisingly, 
both reports contain exactly 4,863 entries
âwhich is unexpected given that the 
iPad is used only 20% as much as the iPhone
.

ð¨ 
Key Concern:

The iPad report 
should have significantly fewer entries
, yet it matches the iPhone 
exactly
.

This suggests 
either:

The reports are identical
 (possible data logging issue).

Apps or services are syncing activity across devices
, inflating the iPadâs report.

ð  Next Steps: Deeper Comparison

Iâll now compare 
specific patterns
 between the two reports:

1ï¸â£ 
Are the "Unknown Domain" counts the same?

2ï¸â£ 
Does the iPad show the same Firebase & Google Login activity?

3ï¸â£ 
Are the most contacted domains the same, or does the iPad have different app behavior?
