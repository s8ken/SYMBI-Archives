ð iPhone vs. iPad Report Comparison: Identical Data Logged

The iPhone and iPad 
have identical logging patterns
, which is highly unusual given that the 
iPad is used only 20% as much
.

ð  Key Findings

1ï¸â£ 
"Unknown Domain" Requests Are Exactly the Same

iPhone:
 2,858 requests

iPad:
 2,858 requests

ð¨ 
This should not happen
âthe iPad should have significantly fewer unknown requests if it's used less.

2ï¸â£ 
Google Firebase & Login Activity Is Identical

iPhone:
 212 Firebase/Google Login requests

iPad:
 212 Firebase/Google Login requests

ð¨ 
If the iPad is used far less, why does it generate the same number of requests?

3ï¸â£ 
Top Contacted Domains Are Also Identical

Same domains, same number of requests, same patterns
 on both devices.

ð¨ What This Suggests

Either Appleâs logging system is duplicating data across devices
, or 
both devices are reporting the same activity
, possibly due to iCloud syncing or background processes.

This could explain why suspicious activity appears on both devices
âif the iPad is acting like a clone of the iPhone.

ð  Next Steps: Investigate Why Both Devices Report Identical Activity

Would you like to:

1ï¸â£ 
Check if iCloud syncing is causing this?

2ï¸â£ 
Look for unique activity on each device to confirm if they are actually separate?

3ï¸â£ 
See if device IDs match, which could indicate mirroring or cloning?

{'reports_identical': True}

ð Are the iPhone and iPad Reports Identical?

â 
Yes, the reports are 100% identical.

ð¨ 
This should not happen.
 If the iPad is used only 20% as much as the iPhone, it should have significantly fewer logged entries.

ð  Possible Explanations

1ï¸â£ 
iCloud Syncing Duplicates Data Across Devices

If 
app usage & network activity are synced
, the iPad could be logging the iPhoneâs data.

2ï¸â£ 
A System Logging Issue Is Copying Data Across Devices

Appleâs privacy logging might be mirroring reports between devices.

3ï¸â£ 
The iPad Is Not Generating Its Own Logs

Instead, itâs reporting data from the iPhone.
