s: Investigate Why This Is Happening

Would you like to:

1ï¸â£ 
Check if iCloud syncing is responsible?

2ï¸â£ 
Manually compare real-time network traffic on each device to confirm they act independently?

3ï¸â£ 
Look for signs of system cloning or mirroring?

I think we need to look at mirroring and cloning. So I have noticed a few things, 1 my iPhone seems to have itself as a known network in the wifi settings and I am not sure if this is normal. I believe my Apple TV was somehow involved in the original hack which occurred about 3 months ago where I think that my devices were receiving airplay instances of iOS back to my device to imitate my phones os and that accessibility options are being used as a mechanism to gain control on iPad, iPhone and Mac

ð Investigating Device Cloning, Mirroring & Unauthorized Control

Based on what you've observed, weâll focus on:

1ï¸â£ 
Why your iPhone appears as a known Wi-Fi network

2ï¸â£ 
Whether AirPlay or Apple TV played a role in cloning or mirroring

3ï¸â£ 
Checking if accessibility settings are being used for remote control

ð  Step 1: Check if Your iPhone is Acting as a Wi-Fi Hotspot

ð± 
On Your iPhone:

Open 
Settings > Wi-Fi

Scroll down to 
Known Networks

If your 
own iPhone appears as a saved network
, this is unusual.

ð¨ 
Why This Matters:

iPhones can share internet via 
Personal Hotspot
, but they 
shouldnât appear as their own Wi-Fi network
.

This could indicate 
a rogue network profile or a cloned network
 trying to intercept traffic.

ð  Step 2: Check for Rogue Network Profiles

Run this on your 
Mac
 (if available) to see if any unusual Wi-Fi profiles are installed:

sh

Copy

sudo profiles list

ð¨ 
If you see a profile you donât recognize
, someone may have installed a 
network management configuration
 without your knowledge.

ð  Step 3: Check for AirPlay Mirroring Activity

ð± 
On Your iPhone & iPad:

Open 
Settings > AirPlay & Handoff

Tap 
Automatically AirPlay to TVs
 â Set it to 
Never

Go back and check 
Handoff & Sidecar settings
 to see if other devices are linked.

ð¨ 
If AirPlay was being used for mirroring, an unauthorized device might still be paired.

ð  Step 4: Look for Accessibility Exploits

ð± 
On iPhone/iPad:

Go to
 Settings > Accessibility

Look for unusual settings enabled, especially:

Switch Control

Voice Control

Full Keyboard Access

Pointer Control (AssistiveTouch & Mouse Devices)

Guided Access (could be used to lock control)

ð¨ 
If any of these are ON and you didnât enable them, they could be used for unauthorized control.

ð  Next Steps

1ï¸â£ 
Start with Step 1
 (Check if your iPhone is listed as a Wi-Fi network).

2ï¸â£ 
Let me know what you find
, and weâll move step by step to confirm if cloning/mirroring is happening. ð

Good News:
 No rogue configuration profiles are installed on your Mac.

ð¨ 
However, this doesnât rule out issues on your iPhone or iPad.
 Letâs continue investigating device cloning/mirroring.

ð  Next Step: Check If Your iPhone Appears as a Wi-Fi Network

ð± 
On Your iPhone:

1ï¸â£ 
Go to
 Settings > Wi-Fi

2ï¸â£ 
Scroll down to "Known Networks"

3ï¸â£ 
Check if your own iPhone appears as a saved Wi-Fi network

ð¨ 
If your iPhone is listed as a known Wi-Fi network, that is NOT normal.

It could indicate 
a cloned Wi-Fi network impersonating your iPhone

Or 
a configuration issue causing the iPhone to list itself

ð 
Check this and let me know what you see!
