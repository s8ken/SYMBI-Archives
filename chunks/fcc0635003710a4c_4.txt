Understood! Let's go one step at a time.

Step 1ï¸â£: Check USB Devices in Safe Mode

This will help determine if something is blocking USB detection in normal mode.

How to Boot into Safe Mode:

Are you using an Intel Mac or an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac?

If you're not sure, click 
ï£¿ (Apple menu) > About This Mac
 and check under "Chip" or "Processor."

Let me know which one you have, and Iâll guide you through the correct steps. ð

Updated saved memory

Thanks! Since you have an 
M1 Mac
, follow these steps to boot into 
Safe Mode
:

Step 1ï¸â£: Boot into Safe Mode

Shut down your Mac completely
 (click 
ï£¿ Apple menu > Shut Down
).

Wait 10 seconds
 to make sure itâs fully off.

Press and hold the Power button
 until you see âLoading startup options.â

Click your 
Macâs main disk
 (usually "Macintosh HD").

Hold the Shift key
, then click 
âContinue in Safe Mode.â

Log in as usual.
 The login screen might say

M1 Pro 2013

ChatGPT said:

Apple 
M1 Pro
 was released in 
2021
, but if you're referring to a 
2013 Mac
, it would have an 
Intel
 processor instead.

Can you double-check? Hereâs how:

Click 
ï£¿ (Apple menu) > About This Mac
.

Look under 
Chip
 (for M1/M2) or 
Processor
 (for Intel).

Let me know what it says! ð

before we do that I want to go back to checking the usb devices please

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Let's check your USB devices again.

Step 1ï¸â£: Check USB Devices

Open 
Terminal
 (Go to 
Applications > Utilities > Terminal
) and type the following command:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Then press Enter.

This will list all connected USB devices. After running the command:

If you see a list of devices, copy and paste the output here.

If nothing appears, let me know.

Try this and tell me what you see! ð

You said:

and yes its a 2023 

ChatGPT said:

Update memory? 

âHas a 2023 M1 Pro Macâ

Yes

No

Thanks for confirming! Now, go ahead and run the USB check in Terminal:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Let me know what appears! ð

File

see attached

ChatGPT said:

Your USB device list only shows the 
built-in USB controllers
 (
AppleT6000USBXHCI
), but 
no external USB devices
 are detected.

What This Means

If you donât have any USB devices plugged in, this is normal.

If you do have USB devices connected (keyboard, mouse, flash drive, etc.) but they donât show up, this is suspicious.

It could indicate 
a system issue
 (corrupted drivers, hardware failure) or 
malware hiding devices
.

Next Step: Test USB Device Detection

Let's check if your Mac 
detects a USB device
 when you plug it in.

Step 1: Plug in a Known USB Device

Use a USB flash drive, wired keyboard/mouse, or any USB accessory.

Step 2: Run This Command Again

After plugging it in, open 
Terminal
 and run:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

What to Look For:

If the device appears, macOS is detecting it properly.

If the device 
still doesnât show up
, something may be blocking USB detection.

Run this test and let me know what happens! ð

are you sure? that looks like a lot of information in that file to say basically nothing? can you summarise the file for me before we proceed to the next step?

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right to double-check! Here's a 
summary
 of your USB device log:

Only Built-in USB Controllers Are Detected

Your Mac lists 
AppleT6000USBXHCI
 controllers, which are part of its internal USB system.

No external devices (like flash drives, keyboards, or mice) appea
