ð Step 1: Confirm If the Unauthorized "m" Account Still Exists

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to list all user accounts:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users

ð 
What to look for:

If 
"m" is listed
, it still exists and needs to be removed.

If only expected accounts appear (e.g., 
"djlcl"
 is legitimate), we still need to check for 
hidden users.

ð  Step 2: Check If "m" Is a Hidden User

Run this:

sh

Copy

dscl . 

read

 /Users/m

ð 
What this does:

Retrieves details about the 
"m" account
 (if it exists).

If the command 
returns data
, the account is still active.

If it says 
"No such key" or "not found,"
 the account may already be removed.

Run these and let me know what you find!

no no - what I want to know is how that differs from the user account search we did about 20 minutes ago

ChatGPT said:

Great question! Let's compare the 
current method (
dscl . list /Users
)
 with the 
user account search we did earlier
 to see the differences.

ð  The Earlier User Account Search

If we ran something like:

sh

Copy

id

whoami

w

or

sh

Copy

ls

 /Users

These would have shown:

The 
currently logged-in user
 (
whoami
).

Active user sessions
 (
w
).

Visible user folders in 
/Users/

 (
ls /Users
).

ð 
Limitations:

Hidden users
 (e.g., ones created by an attacker) may 
not appear
.

System accounts
 might not be included in 
/Users/
.

ð  Whatâs Different About 
dscl . list /Users
?

This 
dumps all user accounts
 registered in 
Directory Services
, even 
hidden or system-level
 ones.

ð 
Why this is important:

dscl . list /Users

shows ALL users
âincluding hidden ones that an attacker may have created.

The 
previous searches might have missed
 an unauthorized account if it wasnât listed in 
/Users/
 or actively logged in.

ð  Why 
dscl . read /Users/m
 Matters

This command:

sh

Copy

dscl . 

read

 /Users/m

ð 
What it does:

Pulls detailed info on "m" (if it exists).

Tells us 
if "m" is a normal, hidden, or admin user.

Shows its 
home directory, UID, and if it has login capabilities.

ð  Summary: Why This Matters Now

â 
If "m" didnât show up before but appears in 
dscl . list /Users
, it's hidden.

â 
If "m" does not appear in 
dscl . list /Users
, then it was removed or never existed.

â 
If 
dscl . read /Users/m
 returns data, we know exactly what permissions it has.

ð 
Would you like to re-run the earlier commands and compare results?

ð  Whatâs Missing?

â 
The unauthorized "m" account does not appear here.

â 
We donât see any other unknown users actively logged in.

However, this only shows 
active users and user shells
. 
To confirm if "m" still exists in the system, we should run:

sh

Copy

dscl . list /Users | grep m

ð 
Would you like to do that now to check if "m" is still in the system?
