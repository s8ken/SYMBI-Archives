r in the log.

No Vendor or Product Information Found

Normally, USB devices show 
vendor IDs
, product names, and connection details.

Your log doesnât contain any of thatâsuggesting no USB devices are recognized.

System Data is Present but Not USB-Specific

The log includes 
a lot of unrelated system info
, such as kernel diagnostics and hardware details.

This makes it look long, but 
thereâs no actual list of external USB devices
.

What This Means

If no USB devices were plugged in, this is expected.

If you had devices connected but they donât show up, it could mean:

A software issue (USB drivers not working).

Malware hiding USB activity.

A hardware problem with the USB ports.

Would you like to continue with the next step (testing USB detection by plugging in a device)? ð

no that's great information for me as I mentioned I don't really know this stuff but its a great way to learn

Updated saved memory

That's awesome! Iâll make sure to explain things in a way that helps you learn while troubleshooting.

Would you like to proceed with the next stepâ
testing USB detection with a plugged-in device
âor do you have any questions about what we found so far? ð

ok next step

ChatGPT said:

Great! Now letâs check if your Mac detects a 
USB device when itâs plugged in
.

Step 1ï¸â£: Plug in a Known USB Device

Use a 
USB flash drive, wired keyboard/mouse, or any other USB accessory
.

Plug it directly into your Macâs USB-C or USB-A port (avoid using a hub for now).

Step 2ï¸â£: Check If macOS Detects It

Once the device is plugged in, open 
Terminal
 and type:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Then 
press Enter
.

Step 3ï¸â£: Look for Changes

If the device 
appears
, macOS is detecting it properly.

If the device 
still doesnât show up
, something may be blocking USB detection.

ð Let me know what you see!
 If thereâs a lot of output, you can copy and paste it here or save it to a file and share it. ð

here you go

ChatGPT said:

Your new USB device log 
still does not show any external USB devices
, even after plugging one in.

Summary of Findings:

Only Built-in USB Controllers Are Detected

The output still only shows 
AppleT6000USBXHCI
, which is your Mac's internal USB controller.

No external USB devices (flash drives, keyboards, etc.) appear.

Possible Reasons:

Hardware issue:
 Your Macâs USB ports may not be working.

Software issue:
 A driver problem could be preventing macOS from detecting USB devices.

Security or malware issue:
 Something may be hiding USB activity.

Next Step: Check If macOS Detects USB Devices Another Way

Step 1ï¸â£: Open System Information

Click 
ï£¿ Apple menu > About This Mac
.

Click 
More Info... > System Report
 (at the bottom).

On the left, select 
USB
 under the "Hardware" section.

Step 2ï¸â£: Look for Your USB Device

If your device 
appears
 here but not in Terminal, that suggests a software or logging issue.

If your device 
still doesnât appear
, it could be a deeper USB detection issue.

Let me know what you find! ð

You said:

oh sorry 

ChatGPT said:

No worries at all! Let me know what you find in 
System Report
 or if you want me to clarify anything. I'm happy to guide you through it! ð

You said:

I'll plug one in 

ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Plug in a 
USB device
 and then check 
System Report
 to see if macOS detects it:

Click 
ï£¿ Apple menu > About This Mac

Click 
More Info... > System Report
 (bottom of the window)

On the left, select 
USB
 under "Hardware"

Look for your plugged-in device

Let me know if it shows up! ð

You said:

shall I just run that command again when I insert it?

ChatGPT said:

Yes! After plugging in the USB device, run the command again in 
Terminal
:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

Then press 
Enter
 and check if the device appears. If it still doesnât show up, weâll try 
System Report
 next.
