yes so I have 1 usb hub connected using one of the usb c ports the others are all ree

ChatGPT said:

Thanks for confirming! Since you have 
only one USB hub connected
, but 
multiple USB devices
 showed up in the System Report, this means the hub itself is detecting and presenting those devices to macOS.

ð What This Tells Us:

â 
Your USB ports are working
 â since macOS detects the hub and devices plugged into it.

â 
Terminal (
ioreg
) still doesnât show USB devices
 â which is unusual.

ð  Next Step: Run This Terminal Command

Now, let's check if 
macOS security settings or software restrictions
 are affecting USB logging.

1ï¸â£ Open Terminal and type:

sh

Copy

csrutil status

Then press 
Enter
.

2ï¸â£ What to look for:

If it says 
"System Integrity Protection: enabled"
, macOS security settings are active.

If it says 
"disabled"
, it could mean a security change or possible tampering.

ð Let me know what it says!

ð System Integrity Protection (SIP) Status: ENABLED

â 
Good News:
 Your Macâs 
System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled
, which means critical system files are protected from unauthorized modifications.

â ï¸ 
However, Terminal (
ioreg
) still isnât showing USB devices, even though System Report does.
 This suggests:

A 
macOS logging issue
 â something is preventing 
ioreg
 from listing devices.

A 
security setting or software bug
 â blocking USB details in Terminal.

(Less likely) 
Malware or tampering
 â though SIP being enabled reduces this risk.

ð  Next Step: Force Refresh USB Detection

Now, let's 
restart the USB subsystem
 and check if Terminal starts detecting devices.

1ï¸â£ Run This Command in Terminal:

sh

Copy

sudo killall -STOP -c usbd && sudo killall -CONT -c usbd

(Youâll be asked for your passwordâtype it and press 
Enter
.)

2ï¸â£ After That, Run This Again to Check USB Devices:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

ð 
Let me know if your USB devices now appear in the Terminal output!

ð Summary of Your Latest USB Check

Unfortunately, 
the 
ioreg
 command still does not list your external USB devices
. Instead, it mostly shows 
system-level information and internal components
, but 
no external USB devices appear
 in the Terminal output.

â Good News:

Your USB devices 
are detected in System Report
, meaning macOS does recognize them.

System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled
, reducing the risk of system tampering.

â ï¸ However:

Terminal (
ioreg
) still isnât showing USB devices
, which is unusual.

This could indicate:

A macOS logging issue
 (possibly a software bug).

A security setting blocking Terminal from seeing USB data
.

Less likely: Malware interfering with USB logs
.

ð  Next Step: Test Another USB Logging Method

Let's try another Terminal command to 
check if USB devices appear differently
.

1ï¸â£ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

What this does:

This retrieves 
USB device details directly from macOS
, similar to System Report.

If your devices 
appear here but not in 
ioreg

, it confirms a logging issue.

If they 
still donât appear
, then something is actively blocking USB detection in Terminal.

2ï¸â£ Let Me Know What Shows Up

If your devices 
appear
, then it's just an issue with 
ioreg
.

If your devices 
donât appear
, we may need to dig deeper into security settings.

ð 
Run the command and let me know what you find!

You said:

could it be that terminal only shows the hub if it is actually being used for something?

ChatGPT said:

Thatâs a great question! 
Yes, it's possible
 that the USB hub itself only appears in 
ioreg
 when an active device is connected to it and in use.

Why This Might Happen:
