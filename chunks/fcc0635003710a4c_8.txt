If the hub is connected but 
has no active devices plugged into it
, macOS might not register it as âin use.â

Some USB hubs also 
enter a low-power state
 when not in use, which could prevent them from appearing in certain logs.

ð  Next Step: Test This Theory

Let's check if plugging a device 
directly into the hub
 makes a difference.

1ï¸â£ Plug a Device Into the USB Hub

Use something like a 
USB flash drive, external keyboard, or wired mouse
.

Make sure it's 
connected to the USB hub
, not directly to your Mac.

2ï¸â£ Run This Command Again:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

If the hub now appears in the output, that confirms your theory!

If 
nothing changes
, then something else is blocking it from appearing.

ð Summary of Your Latest USB Check (With a Mouse Connected)

Even after plugging in a 
USB mouse
, the 
ioreg
 command 
still does not list the external USB device
.

â Good News:

Your Mac detects the USB hub and mouse in System Report
, so the hardware is functioning.

â ï¸ However:

Terminal (
ioreg
) still isnât listing the devices
, meaning:

The hub and mouse may not be actively communicating with the system in a way that 
ioreg
 logs.

macOS might be limiting Terminalâs access to certain hardware data.

A 
software or security restriction
 could be blocking 
ioreg
 from seeing USB activity.

ð  Next Step: Check USB Activity Using a Different Command

Letâs try another method to see if macOS 
logs USB activity differently in Terminal
.

1ï¸â£ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

What This Does:

It fetches 
USB device details
 (similar to System Report) and displays them in Terminal.

If your 
mouse appears here but not in 
ioreg

, it confirms 
ioreg
 is limited in logging USB devices.

If the 
mouse still doesnât appear
, there may be a 
macOS security setting blocking USB logs
.

ð Summary of Your USB Results (
system_profiler SPUSBDataType
)

Your 
System Report in Terminal now correctly lists all connected USB devices
, including:

â 
Your USB Hub (Genesys Logic, Inc.)

â 
Your USB Optical Mouse

â 
Your YubiKey (FIDO Security Key)

â 
A USB Type-C Digital AV Adapter

â 
A Realtek USB Ethernet Adapter

This confirms that 
macOS is correctly detecting and recognizing your USB devices.

â ï¸ But Why Doesnât 
ioreg
 Show These Devices?

Since 
System Report
 detects everything, but 
ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l
 does not, the most likely explanations are:

1ï¸â£ 

ioreg
 Filters Out Certain USB Data:

The 
ioreg
 command 
focuses on active kernel-level device interactions
, rather than listing every detected USB device.

Some hubs and low-power devices 
might not trigger 
ioreg
 logging unless they are actively communicating with the system
 (e.g., transferring data).

2ï¸â£ 
macOS Security or Logging Restrictions:

Apple has been tightening security and system logging access in recent macOS versions.

Some hardware logs may no longer be available in 
ioreg
 by default.

3ï¸â£ 
A Bug or Software Restriction on Your System:

Something could be affecting 
ioreg
's ability to display USB details.

A system update, security setting, or logging policy could be involved.

ð  Next Step: Test an Alternative 
ioreg
 Command

Letâs check if a 
different 
ioreg
 command
 gives more details.

1ï¸â£ Run This in Terminal:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOService -w0 | grep -i usb

What this does:

Instead of only listing USB controllers, it 
searches for all USB-related services
.

If devices appear here, then 
ioreg
 is just filtering them in the original command.

If devices 
still donât appear
, we may need to adjust system logging settings.
