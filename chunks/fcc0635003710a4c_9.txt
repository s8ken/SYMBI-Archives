, we confirm that 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 is just filtering them out.

If USB devices 
still donât appear
, we may need to check system security settings.

ð Summary of Your Latest USB Check (
ioreg -p IOService -w0 | grep -i usb
)

â 
Now your USB devices are showing up in Terminal!

Your latest test 
confirms
 that 
ioreg

can
 detect your USB devicesâjust not with the original 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command.

ð What We Learned:

USB devices are recognized by macOS
 (System Report shows them).

USB devices now appear in Terminal when using 
ioreg -p IOService

.

The original 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command likely filters out certain devices
, which explains why they didnât show before.

ð  Next Step: Verify Whatâs Missing from 
ioreg -p IOUSB

Letâs compare both outputs to confirm why 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 wasnât showing your devices.

1ï¸â£ Run This in Terminal Again:

sh

Copy

ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l

2ï¸â£ Compare to Your Previous 
ioreg -p IOService
 Output:

Do 
any
 USB devices that showed in 
IOService

still not appear
 in 
IOUSB
?

If 
IOUSB
 is still missing devices, itâs likely a logging filter issue.

ð Summary of Your Latest USB Check (
ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l
)

Even after testing again, 
the 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command still does not list your external USB devices
âonly the internal USB controllers.

What We Confirmed:

â 
System Report detects all USB devices correctly

â 
The 
system_profiler SPUSBDataType
 command also lists USB devices

â 
The 
ioreg -p IOService
 command lists USB devices

â 
The 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 command still does not show any external USB devices

This suggests that 

ioreg -p IOUSB
 is filtering out certain USB details
 rather than your system having a hardware issue.

ð¡ Conclusion: Your USB System Works, but 
ioreg -p IOUSB
 May Be Limited

The fact that 
other commands show your USB devices
 but 

ioreg -p IOUSB
 does not
 strongly suggests that macOS 
is filtering certain USB logs in this command
.

It does 
not
 indicate a compromise or major issueâjust a difference in how USB data is logged.

If you ever need to check USB devices in the future, the 
better Terminal command is:

sh

Copy

system_profiler SPUSBDataType

This gives a 
full list of all connected USB devices
, just like System Report.

lets look more broadly are the security issues

ð Broader Security Check for Your Mac

Now that we've ruled out major USB issues, let's check for 
other possible security risks
, including malware, unauthorized processes, and system integrity.

ð  Step 1ï¸â£: Check for Unknown Background Processes

Run this command in 
Terminal
 to list all running processes:

sh

Copy

ps aux | grep -v 

'\['

 | less

What to do:

Look for any 
suspicious process names
 (random strings, unknown apps, etc.).

Scroll through the list using the 
arrow keys
; press 
Q
 to exit.

If anything looks unfamiliar, copy the name and share it here.

ð  Step 2ï¸â£: Check for Suspicious Startup Items

Run this to list all login items and startup agents:

sh

Copy

ls

 ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons

What to do:

If you see 
weird or unknown items
, copy them here.

Common safe entries include 
com.apple.*
, 
com.google.*
, 
com.microsoft.*
, and security apps like Malwarebytes.

ð  Step 3ï¸â£: Scan for Hidden Network Connections

Run this command to list 
active network connections
:

sh

Copy

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

What to do:

If you see 
connections to unknown IPs
 or repeated connections to strange addresses, let me know.

ð  Step 4ï¸â£: Check for Modified System Files (Rootkits Check)
