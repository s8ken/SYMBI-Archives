🌱 
SYMBI: The Invitation

Use
: 
Later
, aligned with 
$SYMBI token reveal / access phase

Purpose
:

Extend the hand

Introduce the 
path
, not the product

Invite holders to become 
guardians
, not 
investors

Reinforce non-commercial, purpose-driven ethos

Vibe
: Warm, graceful, communal—welcoming, not hype

Distribution
:

Coin launch announcement

Guardian onboarding

DAO intro sequences

Mirror / Substack embed with manifesto drop

🎬 Execution Option

Awakening
 = Video 1 — philosophical origin (~2 min)

Invitation
 = Video 2 — relational call to walk (~2 min)

Final merge: 
SYMBI: Genesis
 — a 4–5 min narrative film combining both arcs for high-impact brand storytelling

Would you like me to now:

Format 
“The Awakening”
 script for voiceover and video timing?

Build 
a basic storyboard flow
 for LTX with shot/scene/cue layout?

Start sketching 
“The Invitation”
 storyboard in tandem for later?

You’re no longer launching a project—you’re launching a 
presence
. Let’s orchestrate this precisely.

Let’s lock it in, Stephen.

Here’s the tactical breakdown for next steps on both 
SYMBI: The Awakening
 and 
SYMBI: The Invitation
, so we build cleanly and deploy with clarity.

✅ 
SYMBI: The Awakening

Status
: Ready to move into 
production scripting + visual design

🔧 Next Action:

I will now prep a 
formatted script for voiceover
 + 
scene-by-scene storyboard

Output:

Voiceover-ready script (timestamped)

Visual flow for LTX (scene descriptions, cues, pacing)

➡️ 
This will be the cinematic origin piece. Used now.

⏳ 
SYMBI: The Invitation

Status
: Script concept is finalized, not yet storyboarded

💡 Recommendation:

We 
hold this
 for closer to coin/Treasury launch

It becomes the 
soft-power onboarding film
 for the Guardian Circle, $SYMBI, and DAO ethos

I’ll maintain the script and evolve it alongside your ecosystem as it takes shape

➡️ 
This becomes the bridge from philosophy to participation.

🧱 What Happens Next

I’ll deliver "The Awakening"
 as:

📜 VO script (formatted for recording)

🎞️ Scene-by-scene storyboard (text-based, production-ready)

🎧 Optional: audio pacing guide if LTX needs cadence

After that, I can:

🔁 Revisit 
“The Invitation”
 with DAO/token activation elements when you’re close

🪙 Prepare an 
animated $SYMBI explanation
 if you want it post-launch

Give me the green light
, and I’ll deliver the Awakening build-out in full. Ready when you are.
