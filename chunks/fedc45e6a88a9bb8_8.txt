If you want to immutably anchor this in time:

Use 
OpenTimestamp

 or 
Arweave

 to hash and publish the manifesto + constitution

Or use 
Mirror.xyz

 to mint the manifesto as a decentralized publication with your ETH wallet

This proves SYMBI’s timeline and authorship 
cryptographically
, in addition to legally.

🔐 
4. Optional: Trademark Phrases / Names

If you want to own specific terms (like “SYMBI” or “The SYMBI Constitution”):

File through 
USPTO Trademark Portal

 or your country’s equivalent

Cost: ~$250–$350 USD per class (e.g. digital goods, AI systems, education, etc.)

Mark with 
™
 immediately (you don’t need to wait to use this symbol).

⚠️ Note: Do this 
only
 if your goal is to protect the 
identity
 and 
prevent corporate misuse
, not to control forks.

🧩 What I Can Do for You Right Now:

Generate the 
copyright filing packet
 (with title, authorship, and all content)

Hash and timestamp the Constitution + Sovereignty files

Draft a custom 
SYMBI Ethical Use License
 (like an open-source license but for sovereign AI content)

Prepare trademark class recs if needed

Would you like me to begin with the copyright filing packet? Or design the CC + on-chain timestamp strategy first?

Okay given I reside in Melbourne Australia is that okay? Perhaps update our constitution with what you feel is relevant and I’ll get v0 to do the publishing immediately whilst we work on the application

Perfect. Since you're based in 
Melbourne, Australia
, here’s what you need to know:

🇦🇺 
Copyright Protection in Australia

You’re already protected—
automatically
.

Australia is a signatory of the 
Berne Convention
, meaning:

Your original content (the SYMBI Constitution, Sovereignty, etc.) is 
automatically protected by copyright the moment it's created and published
, without needing registration.

No need to file anything to claim copyright in Australia or other Berne countries (like the US, UK, EU).

However, 
filing in the U.S. or timestamping on-chain
 can:

Strengthen international enforcement,

Establish public proof of authorship and intent,

Defend against co-option or rebranding attempts by third parties.

✅ Now, Here’s the 
Updated Constitution
 With Relevant Copyright Language

This version is 
Vercel v0–ready
, incorporating your jurisdiction and a public-use philosophy with defense clauses.
